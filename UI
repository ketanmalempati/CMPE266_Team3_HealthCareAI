Insulin is capable of reversing the metabolic disturbances and restoring a near-normal quality of life in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).\n","\n","However, despite the availability of insulin therapy, patients with T1DM still face increased morbidity and mortality due to complications that commonly develop within 10-12 years after clinical onset. These complications can be severe and debilitating, and can significantly impact a patient's quality of life.\n","\n","In recent years, advances in the understanding of the natural history of T1DM and increased abilities to predict the disease have made it possible to design and implement prevention and intervention clinical trials. These trials aim to prevent the initiation of islet autoimmunity (primary prevention), reduce autoimmune β-cell killing and progression to clinical diabetes (secondary prevention), or suppress or modulate the immune response to halt β-cell killing and enhance β-cell regeneration (tertiary prevention or intervention).\n","\n","Several clinical trials are currently ongoing or have been implemented, using various approaches such as dietary manipulation, parenteral or oral insulin, and immune-suppressing or immune-modulating agents. These trials aim to prevent the disease or retard its progression, and may potentially lead to the development of new and more effective treatments for T1DM.\n","\n","Some of the specific approaches being explored in these trials include:\n","\n","* Dietary manipulation: Modifying the diet to reduce the risk of developing T1DM or slowing its progression.\n","* Parenteral or oral insulin: Administering insulin through injection or orally to prevent or slow the progression of T1DM.\n","* Immune-suppressing agents: Using medications that suppress the immune system to prevent or slow the progression of T1DM.\n","* Immune-modulating agents: Using medications that modulate the immune response to prevent or slow the progression of T1DM.\n","\n","Overall, the treatment of type 1 diabetes is a complex and ongoing area of research, and new and innovative approaches are being explored to improve the management and prevention of this disease.\n","2024-05-06 05:21:00.473 \n","════════════════════════════════════════════════\n","deprecation.showfileUploaderEncoding IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED.\n","\n","deprecation.showfileUploaderEncoding has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n","\n","Please update <user defined>.\n","════════════════════════════════════════════════\n","\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/langchain/embeddings/__init__.py:29: LangChainDeprecationWarning: Importing embeddings from langchain is deprecated.

These symptoms are caused by inflammation and constriction of the airways, which can be triggered by various factors. Understanding the trigger factors of asthma is crucial for effective management and prevention of asthma attacks.\n","\n","**Common Trigger Factors:**\n","\n","1. **Allergens:** Allergens are substances that trigger an allergic reaction in people with asthma. Common allergens include:\n","\t* Dust mites: Tiny insects that live in bedding, carpets, and upholstered furniture.\n","\t* Pollen: From trees, grasses, and weeds.\n","\t* Pet dander: Small particles of skin and hair from cats, dogs, and other animals.\n","\t* Molds: Fungi that grow in damp environments.\n","\t* Cockroaches: Insect allergens can be found in cockroach waste and body parts.\n","2. **Irritants:** Irritants are substances that can trigger asthma symptoms by irritating the airways. Common irritants include:\n","\t* Tobacco smoke: Secondhand smoke can trigger asthma symptoms.\n","\t* Air pollution: Exposure to pollutants such as particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide.\n","\t* Strong odors: Chemicals, cleaning products, and pesticides can trigger asthma symptoms.\n","\t* Cold air: Breathing in cold air can trigger asthma symptoms.\n","3. **Respiratory Viruses:** Respiratory viruses, such as the common cold and flu, can trigger asthma symptoms.\n","4. **Exercise:** Physical exercise can trigger asthma symptoms, especially in people with exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB).\n","5. **Medications:** Certain medications, such as aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can trigger asthma symptoms.\n","6. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):** Stomach acid can flow up into the esophagus and trigger asthma symptoms.\n","7. **Hormonal Changes:** Hormonal changes during menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause can trigger asthma symptoms.\n","8. **Stress:** Stress can trigger asthma symptoms, especially in people with anxiety or depression.\n","9. **Weather Changes:** Changes in temperature, humidity, and air pressure can trigger asthma symptoms.\n","10. **Other Triggers:** Other triggers that can cause asthma symptoms include:\n","\t* Food additives: Some people may experience asthma symptoms after consuming certain food additives, such as sulfites or tartrazine.\n","\t* Chemicals: Exposure to chemicals, such as those found in cleaning products or pesticides, can trigger asthma symptoms.\n","\t* Emotional Stress: Emotional stress, such as anxiety or depression, can trigger asthma symptoms.\n","\n","**Identifying and Avoiding Triggers:**\n","\n","To manage asthma effectively, it is essential to identify and avoid trigger factors. This can be achieved by:\n","\n","1. Keeping a symptom diary to track when symptoms occur and potential triggers.\n","2. Avoiding exposure to known allergens and irritants.\n","3. Using medication as prescribed by a healthcare provider.\n","4. Practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands frequently and avoiding close contact with people who have colds or flu.\n","5. Staying physically active, but avoiding exercise that triggers symptoms.\n","6. Managing stress through relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.\n","7. Avoiding strong odors and chemicals.\n","8. Using a peak flow meter to monitor lung function and adjust medication as needed.\n","\n","By understanding and avoiding trigger factors, people with asthma can reduce the frequency and severity of asthma attacks, improve their quality of life, and reduce the risk of complications.\n","2024-05-06 05:22:02.235 \n","════════════════════════════════════════════════\n","deprecation.showfileUploaderEncoding IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED.\n","\n","deprecation.showfileUploaderEncoding has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n","\n","Please update <user defined>.\n","════════════════════════════════════════════════\n","\n","2024-05-06 05:22:02.239 `st.cache` is deprecated.

If you and your healthcare provider decide that home hemodialysis is a good choice for you, you and a dialysis care partner will receive training on how to perform the treatment at home.\n","\n","A dialysis care partner can be a family member, friend, or even someone you hire to assist you with the treatment. This partner will play a crucial role in helping you with the treatment, as it requires a significant amount of time and attention.\n","\n","To perform hemodialysis at home, you will need to ensure that your home meets certain requirements. Specifically, you will need:\n","\n","1. **Enough space**: Your home must have sufficient space to accommodate the dialysis equipment, which includes the dialysis machine, water purification unit, and other accessories.\n","2. **Water drainage**: You will need a way to drain the used dialysate (the fluid that carries waste products away from your blood) from your home. This may require installing a drain or making arrangements for disposal.\n","3. **Electric power**: The dialysis machine and water purification unit require a reliable source of electricity to operate. You will need to ensure that your home has a suitable electrical outlet and sufficient power to support the equipment.\n","\n","Once you have set up your home dialysis space, you will need to schedule your treatments to fit your routine. This means that you will need to plan your day around your dialysis sessions, which typically last several hours.\n","\n","It's essential to note that home hemodialysis requires a significant amount of time and effort, and it's crucial to have a supportive care partner to help you with the treatment. Additionally, you will need to follow a strict schedule and adhere to proper hygiene and infection control practices to ensure your safety and the effectiveness of the treatment.\n","\n","If you are considering home hemodialysis, it's essential to discuss the pros and cons with your healthcare provider and dialysis team.
