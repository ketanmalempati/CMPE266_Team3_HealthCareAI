There is no preciseuniversally agreed definition of asthma. The descriptivestatements that exist include references to inflammation in thelungs, increased responsiveness of the airways, and reversibilityof the airflow obstruction.\\nThe clinical picture of asthma in young adults is\\nrecognisable and reproducible. The difficulties in precisediagnosis come in the very young, in older people, and in verymild asthma. Breathlessness from other causes, such as theincreased tendency to obesity, may be confused with asthma.\\nThe clinical characteristic of asthma is airflow obstruction\\nthat can be reversed over short periods of time or withtreatment. This may be evident from provocation by specificstimuli or from the response to bronchodilator drugs. Theairflow obstruction leads to the usual symptoms of shortness ofbreath. The underlying pathology is inflammatory change inthe airway wall leading to irritability and responsiveness tovarious stimuli—and also to coughing, the other commonsymptom of asthma.\\nAsthma has commonly been defined on the basis of wide\\nvariations over short periods of time in resistance to airflow.Recent definitions have come to recognise the importance ofthe inflammatory change in the airways.\\nLow concentrations of non-specific stimuli—such as inhaled\\nmethacholine and histamine—produce airway narrowing. Ingeneral, the more severe the asthma the greater theinflammation and the more the airways react on challenge.Other stimuli—such as cold air, exercise, and hypotonicsolutions—can also provoke this increased reactivity. Incontrast, it is difficult to induce significant narrowing of the\\nairways with many of these stimuli in healthy people. In someepidemiological studies increased airway responsiveness is usedas part of the definition of asthma. Wheezing during the past12 months is added to exclude those who have increasedresponsiveness but no symptoms.\\nIn clinical practice in the UK airway responsiveness\\ndemonstrated in the laboratory is not often used in thediagnosis of asthma. The clinical equivalent of the increasedresponsiveness is development of symptoms in response to dust,smoke, cold air, and exercise; these should be sought in thehistory.\\nLabelling\\nIn the past there was a tendency to use the term “wheezybronchitis” in children rather than “asthma” in the belief thatthis would protect the parents from the label of asthma.\\nMore recently there has been a greater inclination to label\\nand treat mild wheezing or breathlessness as asthma. Thesediagnostic trends have been seen in studies of prevalence.Studies through the 1970s and 1980s showed increasingprevalence, emergency room attendance, admission, and evenmortality, but recent studies suggest a levelling off or decline inthese more severe markers and of self reported wheezing,though the prevalence of the use of label of asthma hasremained high or continued to increase.The International Consensus Report on the Diagnosis and\\nManagement of Asthma gives the following definition: “Asthma isa chronic inflammatory disorder of the airway in which manycells play a role, in particular mast cells, eosinophils, and T lymphocytes. In susceptible individuals this inflammation causesrecurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness,and cough, particularly at night or in the early morning. Thesesymptoms are usually associated with widespread but variableairflow limitation that is at least partly reversible eitherspontaneously or with treatment. The inflammation also causesan associated increase in airway responsiveness to a variety of\\nstimuli.”\\nMultiple genetic factors\\nEarly environmental influences\\nClinical asthmaHyper-responsiveness\\nIrritant triggers Allergic triggers\\nGenetics and the environment influence asthma\\nThe preface to The Treatise of the Asthma by J Floyer,\\npublished in 1717', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/ABC of Asthma.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n"," Document(page_content='ABC of Asthma\\n2The relevance of early environment has been increasingly\\nevident in epidemiological studies. A considerable degree of\\nthe future risk of asthma and course of disease seems todepend on factors before or shortly after birth.\\nSelf reported wheezing in the past 12 months is used as the\\ncriterion for diagnosing asthma in many epidemiologicalstudies. Wheezing is a very common symptom, affecting threequarters of participants at some time in a recent study ofpeople followed up to the age of 26.\\nIn most people with asthma, available treatments can\\nsuppress symptoms to allow normal activity without significantadverse effects. These are the goals of most asthma guidelines.Treatments, however, are not always delivered efficiently, andmany people with milder asthma remain symptomatic. Only afew people have difficult to control asthma or troublesome sideeffects of treatment. In contrast, though we understand moreabout the onset and natural course of asthma, little practicaladvance has yet been made in its cure or prevention.\\nIn infants under the age of 2 wheezing is common because\\nof the small size of the airways. Many of these affected infantswill not go on to wheeze later. In adults who smoke, asthmamay be difficult to differentiate from narrowing of the airwaysthat is part of chronic bronchitis and emphysema caused byprevious cigarette smoking.\\nThe actual diagnostic label would not matter if the\\nappropriate treatment were used. Unfortunately, the evidenceshows that children and adults who are diagnosed as havingasthma are more likely to get appropriate treatment thanchildren with the same symptoms who are given an alternativelabel. In adults, attempts at bronchodilatation and prophylaxisare more extensive in those who are labelled as asthmatic.Asthma is now such a common and well publicised conditionthat the diagnosis tends to cause less upset than it used to. Withadequate explanation most patients and parents will accept it.The correct treatment can then be started. Persistent problemsof cough and wheeze are likely to be much more worrying thanthe correct diagnosis and improvement in symptoms ontreatment. The particular problems of the diagnosis of asthmain very young children are dealt with in chapter 12 (p.51).\\nTreating older patients\\nIn older patients the most common dilemma is differentiationfrom chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As bothconditions are common, some patients will have both. A degreeof increased airway responsiveness is found in COPD in relationto geometry from the narrower airways and the 20% changedefining responsiveness. Bronchodilators can be used for both conditions, although the agent may vary (p.36). Inhaledcorticosteroids are a mainstay early treatment of asthma, but inCOPD they are reserved for more severe disease or frequentexacerbations. When there is doubt they should be used.\\nPathology\\nSince the 1990s there has been more interest in andunderstanding of inflammation in the asthmatic airway.Inflammation in the airway wall involves oedema, infiltrationwith various cells, disruption and detachment of the epitheliallayer, and hypertrophy of mucus glands. Changes occur in thesubepithelial layer, with the laying down of forms of collagenand other extracellular matrix proteins.\\nThis remodelling of the airway wall in response to persistent\\ninflammation can resolve but may result in permanent fibroticdamage, possibly related to the irreversible airflow obstructionthat may develop in poorly controlled asthma.Differential diagnosis in adults\\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\\nGMay be difficult to differentiate from chronic asthma in older\\nsmokers\\nGThe pathology differs, as does the degree of responsiveness to\\nsteroids\\nLarge airway obstruction\\nGCaused by tumours, strictures, and foreign bodies; often\\nmisdiagnosed as asthma initially\\nGDifferentiated by flow volume loop (see p.12)\\nPulmonary oedema\\nGOnce called “cardiac asthma”\\nGMay mimic asthma, including the presence of wheezing and\\nworsening at night\\nIn smokers COPD may be difficult to distinguish from chronic asthma\\nThickening by\\ninflammationwith oedemaand cellularinfiltration\\nMucus plugs\\nHypertrophied\\nsmooth muscleDisrupted\\nepithelium\\nFibrosis under\\nbasement\\nmembrane\\nHypertrophied\\nmucus glands\\nInflammatory changes in the airway', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/ABC of Asthma.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n"," Document(page_content='Definition and pathology\\n3There is evidence that symptoms in very early life are\\nrelated to lifelong change in lung function. Early and\\nprolonged intervention may be necessary to allow normaldevelopment of the airways and lungs and prevent permanentchanges. In older children corticosteroids can suppressinflammation, but this returns, with associated hyper-responsiveness, when the drugs are stopped.\\nThe inflammatory cells involved in asthma include\\neosinophils, mast cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. Dendriticcells, derived from monocytes, present antigen and induceproliferation in naive T cells and primed Th2 cells. Antigencross links IgE to produce activation and degranulation of mastcells. T lymphocytes seem to have a controlling influence onthe characteristic inflammation. Th2 lymphocytes that produceinterleukin 4, 5, 9, and 13 are more common in the airway inasthma. Inflammatory cells are attracted to the airway bychemokines and then bind to adhesion molecules on the vesselendothelium. From there they migrate in to the local tissue.\\nIn acute inflammatory conditions such as pneumonia the\\nprocesses usually resolve. In asthma chronic inflammation candisrupt the normal repair process; growth factors are producedby inflammatory and tissue cells to produce a remodelling ofthe airway. There is proliferation of smooth muscle and bloodvessels with fibrosis and thickening of the basement membrane.Thickened smooth muscle increases responsiveness and,together with fibrosis, reduces airway calibre. Some of thesechanges may be reversible, but others can lead to permanentdamage and reduced reversibility in chronic asthma.\\nClinical evidence\\nEarly evidence on the changes in the airway wall came from afew studies of postmortem material. The understandingadvanced with the use of bronchial biopsies taken atbronchoscopy. These studies showed that, even in remission,there is persistent inflammation in the airway wall.\\nCells from the alveoli and small airways obtained by alveolar\\nlavage can give another measure of airway inflammation.However, this cannot be repeated regularly and is not practicalas a monitor in clinical practice. Induced sputum, produced inresponse to breathing hypertonic saline, is an alternative moreacceptable method.\\nAll these techniques sample different areas and cell\\npopulations and by themselves may induce changes that affectrepeated studies. They have, however, provided valuableinformation on cellular and mediator changes and the effectsof treatment or airway challenge.\\nA simpler method entails analysis of expired air. This has\\nbeen used to measure exhaled nitric oxide produced by nitricoxide synthase, which is increased in the inflamed asthmaticairway. Other possibilities are measurement of pH of theexpired breath condensate, carbon monoxide as a sign ofoxidative stress, or products of arachidonic acid metabolismsuch as 8-isoprostane. These methods hold promise for simplermethods of measuring airway inflammation but are notroutinely used.\\nMucus plugging\\nIn severe asthma, there is mucus plugging within the lumenand loss of parts of the surface epithelium. Extensive mucusplugging is the striking finding in the lungs of patients who dieof an acute exacerbation of asthma.\\nAsthma as a general condition\\nIt has been suggested that asthma is a generalised abnormalityof the inflammatory or immune cells and that the lungs are justthe site where the symptoms show.

The link to thenasal mucosa, however, has been recognised more widely. Thesame trigger factors may affect both areas of the respiratorytract. A combined approach to treatment may be helpful incontrol of each area.\\nTypes of asthma\\nMost asthma develops during childhood and usually variesconsiderably with time and treatment. Young patients usuallyhave identifiable triggers that provoke wheezing, though thereis seldom one single extrinsic cause for all their attacks. This“extrinsic” asthma is often associated with other features ofatopy such as rhinitis and eczema. When asthma starts in adultlife the airflow obstruction is often more persistent and manyexacerbations have no obvious stimuli other than respiratorytract infections. This pattern is often called “intrinsic” asthma.Immediate skin prick tests are less likely to yield positive resultsbecause of a lack of involvement of allergens or a loss of skintest positivity with age.\\nOther categories\\nThere are many patients who do not fit into these broad groupsor who overlap the two types. There are other important typesof asthma, including presentation with just a cough and asthmarelated to occupational exposure.\\nPresentation with a cough is particularly common in\\nchildren. Even in adults it should be considered as the cause ofchronic unexplained cough. In some series of such cases,asthma, or a combination of rhinitis and asthma, explained thecough in about half the patients who had been troubled by acough with no obvious cause for more than two months.\\nChurg-Strauss syndrome is a rare systemic vasculitis\\nassociated with asthma. The asthma is usually severe and oftenprecedes other elements of the condition. The diagnosticcriteria include asthma, blood and tissue eosinophilia, andvasculitis. Treatment is with corticosteroids and otherimmunosuppressants, as well as appropriate treatment for theasthma, which may be difficult to control.Types of asthma\\nChildhood onset\\nGMost asthma starts in childhood, usually in atopic children\\nGTends to have considerable variability and identifiable\\nprecipitants\\nAdult onset\\nGOften a relapse of earlier asthma, but may have initial onset at\\nany age\\nGOften more persistent with fewer obvious precipitants except\\ninfection\\nNocturnal\\nGCommon in all types of asthma\\nGRelated to poor overall control and increased reactivity\\nOccupational\\nGUnderdiagnosed\\nGNeeds expert evaluation\\nCough variant\\nGCough is a common symptom and may precede airflow\\nobstruction\\nExercise induced\\nGCommon precipitant\\nGMay be the only significant precipitant in children\\nBrittle\\nGTwo types:\\nChaotic uncontrolled asthma with variable peak flow\\nSudden severe deteriorations from a stable baseline\\nAspirin sensitive\\nGMay be associated with later onset and nasal polyps\\nGOnly 2-3% have a history of asthma but formal tests identify\\nasthma in 10-20%\\nChurg-Strauss syndrome\\nGAn uncommon diffuse vasculitis characterised by severe\\npersistent asthma\\nGInitial clue may be high eosinophilia ( /H110221500/ /H9262l) or vasculitic\\ninvolvement of another organABC of Asthma\\n4Further reading\\nGChronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

A familial link has beenrecognised for some time together with an association withallergic rhinitis and allergic eczema. The familial link withatopic disorders is strongest in childhood asthma and with thelink to maternal atopy. Earlier investigations were helped bystudies of isolated communities—such as in Tristan da Cunha,where the high prevalence of asthma can be traced to threewomen among the original settlers.\\nGenetic studies\\nEarly studies of genetic links within families with more thanone member with asthma suggested a strong link to certaingenetic regions of interest, particularly 5q and llq. Furtherstudies in different populations did not replicate all the earlyfindings, and it became evident that, as in other commonconditions, the genetic links were not simple. Several issueshave been identified, and there seem to be differences in thelinks between ethnic groups. Susceptibility seems to bedetermined by several genes that have an effect in differentaspects of asthma. There has been steady progress moving fromareas of broad linkage to candidate asthma genes. Again,findings have not always been replicated in differentpopulations. Genes have been identified that are linked to theTh2 cytokine signalling pathway, Th2 cell differentiation,airway remodelling, innate and adaptive immune responses,and IgE levels. Most of the work relates to the presence ofasthma. Further work is investigating different asthmaphenotypes and the natural course and severity of asthma, andinteraction with environmental influences.\\nFuture investigations\\nFuture investigations in the genetics of asthma may teach usmore about susceptibility and progression in asthma. Geneticinfluences may also underlie different responses to treatmentand raise the promise of matching treatment to a patient’sindividual response and the production of new forms oftherapy aimed at influencing specific genes and their products.\\nEarly environment\\nGenetic susceptibility alone does not account for thedevelopment or persistence of asthma. Genetic susceptibility islinked to environmental exposure. Early environmentalinfluences before and soon after birth may be particularlyimportant. The type and extent of exposure to allergens andinfections may influence the development of the immuneprocess and the likelihood of the development of asthma.\\nThe hygiene hypothesis links to this balance of the parts of\\nthe immune system. It was noted that asthma was less likely todevelop in children with older siblings. The hypothesis is thatprocesses such as earlier exposure to infections from oldersiblings and commensal gut bacteria may help the maturationof the immune system and the switch to a Th1 lymphocytephenotype rather than the Th2 phenotype. The Th1 cellularimmune responses are related to protection against manyinfections while Th2 responses favour atopy. This wassupported by evidence that asthma and allergies are lesscommon in children brought up on farms and in close contactwith animals.Asthma\\nHayfeverEczema\\nFamily tree of an atopic family\\nWagga Wagga BelmontPrevalence of wheeze (%)\\n019821015202530\\n51992 1982 1992\\nIncrease in prevalence of wheeze in children aged 8-10 in two towns in \\nNew South Wales between 1982 and 1992.

They can beidentified by immediate positive results from skin prick tests tocommon allergens\\nThe development of asthma depends on environmental\\nfactors acting with a genetic predisposition. The movement ofracial groups with a low prevalence of asthma from an isolatedrural environment to an urban area increases the prevalence inthat group, possibly because of their increased exposure toallergens such as house dust mites and fungal spores or toinfectious agents, pollution, and dietary changes.\\nFamily history —The chance of a person developing asthma\\nby the age of 50 is 10 times higher if there is a first degreerelative with asthma. The risk is greater the more severe therelative’s asthma. It has been suggested that breast feedingcould reduce the risk of a child developing atopic conditionssuch as asthma because it restricts the exposure to ingestedforeign protein in the first few months of life. Conflictingresults have been published, and it may require considerabledietary restriction by the mother to avoid passing antigen on tothe child during this vulnerable period. Overall, though infantwheezing may be less common in breastfed infants, there is nogood evidence to show that asthma is less prevalent.Nevertheless, the many other benefits of breast feeding indicatethat it should be encouraged.\\nSmoking in pregnancy —Maternal smoking in pregnancy\\nincreases the risk of childhood asthma; exposure during thefirst few years of life is also detrimental. Studies of paternalsmoking have produced similar but less certain trends.\\nWeight control —Obesity is associated with an increased\\nlikelihood of asthma. Regular exercise to maintain fitness andcontrol weight is sensible advice for people with asthma.\\nDiagnostic criteria in epidemiological\\nstudies\\nFor epidemiological purposes, a common set of criteria is the\\npresence of symptoms in the previous 12 months and evidenceof increased bronchial responsiveness. Phase 1 of theinternational study of asthma and allergies in childhood(ISAAC) looked at prevalence of symptoms in 13-14 year olds in 155 centres worldwide. Prevalence rates differed over 20-fold,and ISAAC phase 2 will explore these differences. The Odensestudy in children found 27% with current symptoms of asthmabut only 10% were diagnosed as asthmatic. Different diagnostictests, such as methacholine responsiveness, peak flowmonitoring, and exercise testing, did not correlate well witheach other. Each test was reasonably specific, but individualsensitivities were low. The combination of peak flow monitoringat home and methacholine responsiveness produced the bestresults.\\nPrevalence figures\\nThe reported prevalence depends on the definition of asthmabeing used and the age and type of the studied population.Regional variations exist, particularly in developing countries,where rates in urban areas are higher than in poor rural\\nPrevalence of asthma (%)\\n01015202530\\n5\\nLiving in\\nTokelau IslandsLiving in\\nNew ZealandPrevalence of asthma in Tokelauan children aged 0–14 still in the Tokelau\\nIslands or resettled to New Zealand.

The strong genetic element has not changed so anytrue increase, other than in changes in detection or diagnosis,must come from environmental factors. No single explanationis likely as the possible factors do not apply equally to all thepopulations experiencing the change in prevalence.\\nChange in the indoor environment —The advent of centrally\\nheated homes with warm bedrooms, high humidity, and softfurnishings probably increases exposure to house dust mite.This may be part of the explanation but does not fit withchanges in developing countries.\\nSmoking —Maternal smoking during pregnancy and infancy\\nis associated with an increased prevalence of asthma inchildhood.

A few patients, probably around 15-20%, willbe unaware of moderate changes in their airflow obstructioneven when these occur acutely; these patients are at particularrisk of an acute exacerbation without warning. They should beencouraged to take regular peak flow recordings and enterthem on a diary card to permit them to see trends in peak flowmeasurements and react to exacerbations at an early stagebefore there is any change in their symptoms.\\nWritten asthma action plans\\nMini peak flow meters are inexpensive and have an importantrole in educating patients about their asthma. Simply giving outa peak flow meter, however, has little benefit. Using homerecordings, the doctor or nurse and patient can work togetherto develop plans with criteria that indicate the need for achange in treatment, a visit to the doctor, or emergencyadmission to hospital.

Reversibility is often used to establish the diagnosisof asthma or to find out which is the most effectivebronchodilator. Because of the variability in asthma, airflowobstruction may not be present at the time of testing.Reversibility is relatively specific but not very sensitive as adiagnostic test in patients with mild asthma.\\nMeasuring reversibility\\nReversibility is usually assessed by recording the best of threepeak flow measurements and repeating the measurements 15-30 minutes after the patient has inhaled two or more dosesof a /H9252agonist—salbutamol or terbutaline—from a metered\\ndose inhaler or dry powder system. The method of inhalationshould be supervised and the opportunity taken to correct thetechnique or change to a different inhalation device ifnecessary. The 95% confidence intervals for a change in peakflow rate on such repetitions are around 60 l/min, and it isusual to look for a change in peak flow of 20% and 60 l/min.Reversibility can also be assessed in response to nebulisedbronchodilator or a course of oral or inhaled steroid.\\nWhen forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV\\n1) is the\\nmeasurement used, a change of 200 ml is outside the variabilityof the test. Such changes suggest asthma rather than COPD. A standard dose of a /H9252agonist can be combined with an\\nanticholinergic agent—ipratropium bromide. These agents areslower to act than /H9252agonists, and their effect should be\\nassessed 40-60 minutes after inhalation.\\nWhen there is severe obstruction and reversibility is limited,\\napplication of strict reversibility criteria may be correct fordiagnosis but inappropriate for the purpose of determiningtreatments. Any response may be worth while so attentionshould be paid to subjective responses and improvement ofexercise tolerance together with results of other tests ofrespiratory function. Reversibility shown by other tests, such asthose of lung volumes or trapped gas volumes, without changesin peak flow or FEV\\n1are more likely to occur in patients with\\nCOPD than in those with asthma.\\nPeak flow variation\\nCharacteristic of asthma is a cyclical variation in the degree ofairflow obstruction throughout the day. The lowest peak flowvalues occur in the early hours of the morning and the highestoccur in the afternoon. To see the pattern a peak flow metershould be used at least twice and up to four times a day.Possible reasons for this variation include diurnal variation inadrenaline, vagal activity, cortisol, airway inflammation, andchanges in /H9252\\n2receptor function.\\nDiurnal variation\\nDocumentation of diurnal variation by recording measurementsfrom a peak flow meter shows typical diagnostic patterns in manypatients. The timing of the measurements should be recorded,otherwise typical variations can be obscured by later readings atthe weekend or on days away from work or school. Variation hasbeen calculated in several different ways. Amplitude % best iscalculated as (highest /H11002lowest)/highest /H11003100. Amplitude %\\nbest of 20% on three days of two consecutive weeks is likely tomean that asthma is present, but changes smaller than this donot exclude asthma.Diagnostic testing and monitoring\\n9Time (seconds)Volume\\n1After bronchodilator\\nBefore bronchodilator\\nReversibility in asthma is shown by change in FEV 1on spirometry\\nDaysPeak flow (l/min)\\n1 2 3 4 50200300400\\n100\\nDiurnal percentage variation in peak flow readings.

Questions about sleep disturbance bybreathlessness and cough should be asked routinely inconsultations with patients. Deaths from asthma are also morelikely to occur in the early hours of the morning.\\nExercise testing\\nThe provocation test most often used in the United Kingdom is asimple exercise test. Exercise testing is a safe, simple procedureand may be useful when the diagnosis of asthma is in doubt.Patients without asthma do not develop bronchoconstriction onexercise; indeed they usually show a small degree ofbronchodilation during the exercise itself. When baseline lungfunction is low, provocation testing is unnecessary for diagnosisas reversibility can be shown by bronchodilatation.\\nExercise testing and the recording of diurnal variations are\\nused when the history suggests asthma but lung function isnormal when the patient is seen.\\nTesting outdoors\\nThe exercise is best done outside because breathing cold dry airintensifies the response. The characteristic asthmatic response isa fall in peak flow of more than 15% several minutes after theend of exercise. About 90% of asthmatic children will show adrop in peak flow in response to exercise. Once the peak flowrate has fallen by 15% the bronchoconstriction should bereversed by inhalation of a bronchodilator. Late reactions aboutsix hours after challenge are unusual, so, unlike challenge withan allergen, patients do not need to be kept under observationfor late responses after the initial response has been reversed.Such tests are best avoided if the patient has ischaemic heartdisease, but there is no reason why peak flow measurementsshould not be included during supervised exercise testing forcoronary artery disease when this is appropriate.\\nOther types of challenge\\nThe exercise test relies on changes in temperature and in theosmolality of the airway mucosa. Other challenge tests that relyon similar mechanisms include isocapnic hyperventilation;breathing cold, dry air; and osmotic challenge with nebuliseddistilled water or hypertonic saline. These are, however,laboratory based procedures whereas the simple exercise testfor asthma can be done at any clinic or surgery.\\nBronchodilators and sodium cromoglicate should be\\nstopped at least six hours before the exercise test and longacting oral or inhaled bronchodilators and /H9252antagonists\\nshould be stopped for at least 24 hours. Prolonged use ofinhaled corticosteroids reduces responses to exercise, but theseare not usually stopped before testing because the effect takesdays or weeks to wear off.\\nAirway hyperresponsiveness\\nOther common forms of non-specific challenge to the airwaysare the inhalation of methacholine and histamine. These testsproduce a range of responses, usually defined as the dose ofthe challenging agent necessary to produce a drop in the FEV of20%.

It isa safe procedure, providing it is monitored carefully and notused in the presence of moderately severe airflow obstruction.\\nAirway muscle is increased in asthma.

It would be unusual, however, tosustain the diagnosis of asthma in a patient with normal airwayresponsiveness on no treatment.\\nDegree of responsiveness\\nThe degree of responsiveness is associated with the severity ofthe airways disease. It can be reduced by strict avoidance ofknown allergens. Drugs such as corticosteroids reduceresponsiveness through their effect on inflammation in the wallof the airway, but they do not usually return reactivity to thenormal range. Use of a bronchodilator is followed by atemporary reduction while the mechanisms of smooth musclecontraction are blocked.\\nSpecific airway challenge\\nChallenge with specific agents to which a patient is thought tobe sensitive must be done with caution. The initial dose shouldbe low, and, even so, reactions may be unpredictable. Earlynarrowing of the airway by contraction of smooth muscleoccurs within the first 30 minutes, and there is often a “lateresponse” after four to eight hours.\\nThe late response may be followed by poorer control of the\\nasthma and greater diurnal variation for days or weeksafterwards. The late response is thought to be associated withrelease of mediators and attraction of inflammatory cells to theairways. It has been used in drug development as a moresuitable model for clinical asthma than the brief early response.\\nChallenges with specific allergens are used mostly for the\\ninvestigation of occupational asthma, but they should berestricted to experienced laboratories. Patients should besupervised for at least eight hours after challenge.\\nSkin tests\\nIn skin prick tests a small amount of the test substance isintroduced into the superficial layers of the epidermis on thetip of a small needle. The tests are painless, just causingtemporary local itching. More general reactions aretheoretically possible but extremely rare. Most young peoplewith asthma show a range of positive responses to commonenvironmental allergens such as house dust mite, pollens, andanimal dander. A weal 3 mm larger than the negative controlthat develops 15 minutes after a skin prick test suggests thepresence of specific IgE antibody; the results correlate well withthose of in vitro tests for IgE such as the radioallergosorbenttest (RAST), which is more expensive but may be helpful indifficult cases in the presence of widespread asthma.Diagnostic testing and monitoring\\n11Bronchial reactivity is an important epidemiological and\\nresearch tool.

Suspicions can beconfirmed by skin tests, RAST, or, less often, by specificinhalation challenge.\\nConclusions\\nAlthough positive results to skin tests do not incriminate theallergen as a cause of the patient’s asthma, it would be rare foran inhalant to be important in asthma with a negative result.The results do, however, rely on the quality of the agents usedin testing and will be negative if antihistamines or leukotrienereceptor antagonists are being taken. Bronchodilators andcorticosteroids have no appreciable effect on immediate skinprick test results.\\nDifferential diagnosis\\nThe difficulty in breathing that is characteristic of asthma maybe described as a constriction in the chest that suggestsischaemic cardiac pain. Nocturnal asthma that causes thepatient to be woken from sleep by breathlessness may beconfused with the paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea of heartfailure.\\nAsthma and COPD\\nAfter some years, particularly when it is severe, asthma may losesome or all of its reversibility. COPD, usually caused by cigarettesmoking, may show appreciable reversibility, which can make itquite difficult to be sure of the correct diagnosis in olderpatients with partially reversible obstruction. The pathologicalchanges in the airway are different in asthma and COPD.\\nIn practice, however, bronchodilators are given and\\ncorticosteroids often used to establish the best airway functionthat can be achieved. Inhaled corticosteroids are much moreimportant in asthma treatment than in COPD. When there isreversibility to bronchodilators and any doubt whether thediagnosis might be asthma, inhaled corticosteroids should bepart of the treatment.\\nNon-asthmatic wheezing\\nOther causes of wheezing, such as obstruction of the largeairways, occasionally produce problems in diagnosis.

Most wheezychildren improve during their teens, but the outlook dependsto some extent on the severity of their early disease.\\nOver half the children whose wheezing is infrequent will be\\nfree of symptoms by the time they are 21, but of those withfrequent troublesome wheezing, only 20% will be symptom-freeat 21, although 20% will be substantially better. In 15% ofpatients, asthma becomes more troublesome in early adultyears than it was in childhood. Even if there is prolongedremission lasting several years, symptoms may return later. In aNew Zealand study wheezing was persistent in 14.5% ofchildren up to the age of 26, while 12.4% wheezed inchildhood, remitted, and then relapsed by 26. After monthsfree from symptoms, biopsy studies show that the airwayepithelium may still be inflamed and airway responsiveness tomethacholine and histamine may remain abnormally high. Thissuggests that the underlying tendency to be asthmatic remains.\\nLikelihood of remission\\nAsthma is less likely to go into remission in patients with astrong family history of atopy or a personal history of otheratopic conditions, low respiratory function, onset after the ageof 29, and frequent attacks. More boys than girls are affected byasthma but the girls do less well during adolescence and byadulthood the sex ratio is equal. Most of those who do grow outof asthma are left with no residual effects other than the risk ofrecrudescence. Smoking increases the likelihood of persistence,while an early onset is predictive of relapse. In those withpersistent asthma through childhood, results of respiratoryfunction tests are significantly poorer. Chest deformities areuncommon and occur only when there is severe intractabledisease.\\nAdult height\\nAlthough puberty may be delayed, the final adult height ofchildren with asthma is usually normal unless they havereceived long term treatment with systemic or high doseinhaled corticosteroids.\\nPrognosis in adults\\nAsthma in adults often shows less spontaneous variation than itdoes in children. Wheezing is more persistent, and there is lessassociation with obvious precipitating factors other thaninfections. The chances of a sustained remission are also lowerthan in children. Smokers with increased bronchial reactivityare particularly at risk of developing chronic airflowobstruction, and it is vital that people with asthma do notsmoke. When there are known precipitating agents that can beavoided—such as animals or occupational factors—thensustained removal of these can reduce bronchial reactivity. Theavoidance of contact with known allergens can decrease theinflammation in the airway wall and thus reduce responses tonon-specific agents, including cigarette smoke, cold air, anddust. It can lead to an improvement in the control and theprogress of the asthma.\\n144 Clinical course\\nParents hope that their children’s asthma will improve\\nas they get older\\nBronchial biopsy specimen from patient with asthma\\nshowing eosinophilia and increased basement membrane(courtesy of Chris Corrigan)\\nAsthma: things to avoid\\nGKnown allergens\\nGActive and passive cigarette smoking\\nGAreas of high pollution (particularly avoid exercising\\nat times of high air pollution)\\nG/H9252blockers\\nGAspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\\nGObesity', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/ABC of Asthma.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n"," Document(page_content='The reversibility of airway obstruction in asthma is not\\nalways maintained throughout life. Those with more severe\\nasthma are most likely to go on to develop irreversible airflowobstruction. It is likely that this progression to irreversibility isrelated to persistent inflammation of the wall of the airway,which leads to permanent damage through remodelling of theairway wall. Suitable prolonged prophylaxis reduces theinflammation, and most chest physicians act on the belief thatthis will reduce the likelihood of long term damage andeventual irreversibility. There are few prolonged studies toprove or disprove this contention, but the benefits of anti-inflammatory prophylaxis are well established in the shortterm, and it seems prudent to follow this practice.\\nA few studies on the introduction of inhaled corticosteroids\\ngive some hope that treatment can affect the clinical course.The degree of impairment in lung function when patientstarted inhaled steroids was greatest in those with the longesthistory of symptoms, suggesting that more prolonged untreateddisease may lead to irreversible change. Delayed onset ofinhaled steroids in one study comparing /H9252agonists and steroids\\nseemed to reduce the potential benefit of the steroids.

The deathsin the 1960s have been attributed to cardiac stimulation causedby overuse of inhaled isoprenaline or to excessive reliance onits usual efficacy leading to delay in using appropriatealternative treatment when symptoms worsened. Isoprenalineas a bronchodilator has been superseded by safer /H9252\\n2stimulants.\\nAfter the peak in the 1960s, the number of deaths from\\nasthma in the United Kingdom stabilised. In the late 1980s therewas a suggestion of a gradual rise in mortality to about 2000 peryear but statistics for the 1990s show a gradual decline. Thefigures are most reliable for the ages 5–34, and the most recentfigures confirm a slight fall in mortality in the group. Confidentialinquiries into deaths suggest that clinical management issues havereduced, whereas patients’ factors such as compliance andpsychosocial problems have become more important.\\nNeed for rapid response\\nInvestigation of the circumstances surrounding individualdeaths generally finds evidence of undertreatment rather thanexcessive medication in such deaths. Doctors and patientsunderestimate the severity of attacks; the most important factormay be an apparent reluctance to take oral corticosteroids forsevere episodes and to adjust treatment early during periods ofdeterioration. Nevertheless, about a quarter of deaths occurless than an hour after the start of an exacerbation. Patientswho have such rapid deterioration are particularly vulnerable.If patients have deteriorated swiftly in the past they should havesuitable treatment readily available, such as steroids andnebulised and injectable bronchodilators.

This avoids delay in\\nadmission to hospital and is a logical development of involvingpatients in the management of their own disease.\\nDiurnal variation\\nSome studies have shown that patients are particularly at riskafter they have been discharged from intensive care or highdependency units to ordinary wards and after discharge fromhospital. Problems often occur in the early hours of themorning at the nadir of the diurnal cycle. They may be relatedto premature tailing off of the initial intensive treatmentbecause the measurements during the day have beensatisfactory. Monitoring of peak flow will identify the instabilityof the asthma manifested by a large diurnal variability in peakflow. Adequate supervision and treatment must be maintainedthroughout these periods until control is restored.\\nBritish guideline on the management of asthma\\nAssessment and management in hospital have also been criticised.Asthma is a popular subject for audit according to the consensusguidelines of the British Thoracic Society (BTS) and the ScottishIntercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). Studies have shownthat initial assessment and treatment are satisfactory but thatthere are weaknesses in the exploration of reasons for an attack,establishment of adequate control before discharge, andarrangements for follow-up. Meeting the criteria of PEF /H1102275%\\nbest or predicted, diurnal variability /H1102125%, and establishment of\\na personalised management plan are the commonest problems inaudits of asthma care. Every admission should be regarded as afailure of routine management. The usual treatment, compliancewith therapy, and the existence and performance of managementplans should be explored with the patient. Quality of treatment,readmission rates, and asthma control are improved when thosewith an interest in thoracic medicine supervise the inpatient care.Admission to hospital is an appropriate opportunity to involve arespiratory nurse specialist in the management.\\nMorbidity\\nAsthma causes considerable morbidity with persistent symptomsand loss of time from work and school. Repeated studies haveshown that the aims of most guidelines are not met in a largeproportion of patients. In milder disease (steps 1-3 of the BTSguidelines) the aim is control with no symptoms, no limitationof activity, and no adverse effects of treatment. This is achievedin less than half of patients, which suggests that the expectationsof many doctors and patients are not high enough. Half of allpatients have their sleep disturbed by asthma more than once aweek, and this leads to poorer daytime performance. There hasbeen a shift in the general approach to management, aiming toproduce freedom from symptoms rather than a tolerableexistence free of disabling attacks. The aims of the first threesteps of the BTS guidelines involve virtual freedom fromsymptoms with minimal or no use of rescue bronchodilator. In children this would include freedom to take part in regularexercise. This requires a more aggressive approach early in thecourse of the disease with regular anti-inflammatory drugs andwill, it is hoped, lead to a reduction in morbidity fromexacerbations of asthma and long term damage.\\nEducation of patients\\nEducating patients about their asthma and the use of treatmentis an integral part of management.

Whileinflammatory change in the airway wall is associated withincreased reactivity, the underlying mechanisms of increasedbronchial reactivity are uncertain. The sustained reactivityfound in patients with asthma has been attributed to imbalanceof autonomic control or other non-adrenergic, non-cholinergicplexuses, abnormal immunological and cellular responses,increased permeability of the epithelium, and intrinsicdifferences in the action of smooth muscle or its hypertrophy.\\nNon-specific stimuli\\nAirways in people with asthma are usually sensitive to non-specific stimuli such as dust and smoke. Laughing or coughingmay provoke wheezing. Specific responses to agents such aspollen may lead to increased non-specific reactivity andsymptoms of asthma for days or even weeks. Upper respiratoryviral infections may lead to similar changes and may increasereactivity in people without asthma. In contrast, avoidance ofexposure to known allergens may lead to improved control ofasthma with reduced responses to other stimuli. Challenge toairways by specific allergens may induce late responses six toten hours after exposure. Such late responses may mimic moreclosely the inflammatory changes caused by asthma that occurspontaneously. They lead to a subsequent rise in non-specificairway reactivity.\\nExercise\\nVigorous exercise produces narrowing of the airways in mostpeople with asthma and, as described in chapter 2, can be usedas a simple diagnostic test. Asthma during or after exercise ismost likely to be a practical problem in children, in whom itmay interfere with games at school. The type of exerciseinfluences the response; most people find that swimming inwarm indoor pools is the activity least likely to induce an attack.This observation has been explained by clinical studies showingthe importance of cooling and drying of the airways duringhyperventilation and exercise.\\nDrug prophylaxis\\nMany of the commonly used drugs protect against exerciseinduced asthma. Use of a short acting /H9252agonist 15-30 minutes\\nbefore exercise is usually effective and such treatments willnormally allow a child to take part in games at school. Sodiumcromoglicate and nedocromil sodium also block the response.Long acting /H9252agonists and leukotriene receptor antagonists\\ncan prevent or minimise exercise induced asthma.

Variousover the counter preparations for upper airway symptoms arenot allowed.\\nRefractoriness\\nA second bout of exercise within an hour or so of the first isoften less troublesome, a phenomenon known as refractoriness.The general benefits of warming up before exercise maytherefore be greater for asthmatic athletes. Late asthmaticresponses four to six hours after exposure to allergens arecommon, but they are rare and not troublesome after exercise.\\nAllergens in the home\\nPets\\nThe parents of children with asthma often worry abouthousehold pets. Cats cause the greatest problem, with allergens insaliva, urine, and dander, but most domestic animals can triggerasthma on occasions. Associated symptoms of conjunctivitis andrhinitis are common. People who have major problems with theirasthma should be advised not to acquire any new pets.\\nWhen children are born into a family with a strong history\\nof atopy, furry pets are best avoided. Pets already in residenceshould be kept out of bedrooms and off soft furnishings. If theanimal seems to be a cause of serious symptoms, a trialseparation should be organised. Animal allergens remain in thehouse long after the pet is removed so the pet should move outfor a month or two; alternatively the patient could move out fora week or two. Unjustified removal of favourite pets withoutgood reason may, however, provoke more serious problemsfrom emotional upset.\\nThe position is complicated by evidence that asthma is less\\ncommon in children born to families with pets or domesticanimals. This is connected with the maturation of the immunesystem from early exposure to allergens and infections.\\nDust mites\\nThe house dust mite, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, provides\\nthe material for the most common positive skin prick test in theUK. The main allergen is found in the mites’ faecal pellets. The mites live off human skin scales and are widely distributedin bedding, furniture, carpets, and soft toys and thrive best inwarm damp conditions. The expectation of a warmenvironment at home has increased the exposure of children toallergens and is likely to be an important element in theincreased prevalence of asthma.\\nChange of environment\\nIf patients move into environments that are completely free ofhouse dust mites their symptoms improve. This can be achievedin the mountains of Switzerland or near to home, but lesspicturesque, in specially cleaned hospital wards without softfurnishings.\\nIt is more difficult to reduce the numbers of mites\\nsufficiently in the home. Regular cleaning of bedrooms andavoiding materials that are particularly likely to collect dust aresensible measures to keep down the antigenic load.

Although thesemeasures reduce mite numbers they have little effect on controlof asthma, probably because they do not produce enough of asustained reduction in house dust mite antigen. Desensitisationto house dust mites may be of some use in children.\\nFood allergy\\nFood allergy causes eczema and gastrointestinal symptomsmore often than asthma, but some striking cases do occur.Exclusion diets have generally given disappointing results inasthma; immediate skin prick tests and radioallergosorbenttests are less useful than for inhaled allergens. Most seriouscases of asthma induced by food intolerance are evident from acarefully taken history, so elaborate diets are not warranted.When there is doubt, suspicions can be confirmed by excludingthe agent from the diet or by controlled exposure.\\nIntolerance to food does not always indicate an allergic\\nmechanism. Reactions may be related to pharmacologicalmediators such as histamine or tyramine in the food. They maybe produced by food additives such as the yellow dye tartrazine,which is added to a wide range of foods and medications. Whenthere is a specific allergy to foodstuffs, the most likely to beimplicated are milk, eggs, nuts, and wheat. Management can bedifficult because of the use of nuts in a wide range or products.\\nPollens and spores\\nSeasonal asthma, often together with rhinitis and conjunctivitis,is usually associated with grass pollens, which are most commonduring June and July. Less common in the UK is precipitationof asthma by tree pollens, much of which is produced betweenFebruary and May, and mould spores from Cladosporium and\\nAlternaria , which abound in July and August. Complete\\navoidance of such widespread pollens is impractical.\\nHyposensitisation\\nThe effectiveness of hyposensitisation is debatable. It is generallyunnecessary because inhaled drugs usually produce adequatecontrol and are simple to use. The strong placebo effect,allergic reactions to hyposensitisation, and the occasional deathmust also be taken into account in assessing its value. Somestudies show some benefits and advances in allergen productionand manipulation may lead to greater future use.\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary\\naspergillosis\\nSome people with asthma develop sensitivity to the spores of\\nAspergillus fumigatus , which is a common fungus particularly\\npartial to rotting vegetation.

Some estimates suggest that up to 10% of cases ofadult asthma have an occupational origin and over 200precipitating agents have been reported. People with asthmashould avoid occupations where they are likely to be exposed tolarge quantities of non-specific stimuli such as dust and cold air.An occupational element should always be considered,particularly with adult onset asthma\\nDefinition\\nOccupational asthma is officially recognised as an industrialdisease and is subject to compensation. It is defined as asthmathat “develops after a variable period of symptomless exposureto a sensitising agent at work” (www.occupationalasthma.com/).Fourteen agents are currently recognised for compensation,and this list is kept under regular review. Agents such asproteolytic enzymes and laboratory animals are particularlylikely to produce problems in atopic people, whereas isocyanateasthma is not related to atopic status. In some studies potentagents such as platinum salts have produced asthma in up tohalf of those who are exposed to them.\\nDiagnosis\\nIncreased bronchial reactivity provoked by occupational agentsmay persist long after the person is no longer exposed. Regularpeak flow recordings are once again an important diagnostictool and usually show a distinct relation to time at work, but theassociation may not be obvious because the timing of theresponses is variable. Reactions may occur soon after arrival atwork, be delayed until later in the day, or come on slowly overseveral days. In some cases a weekend away from work may notbe long enough for lung function to return to normal andabsence for a week or two may be necessary. Initialinvestigations include exploration of potential agents at workand recording peak flow patterns every two or four hours atand away from work. Further investigation may require specificchallenge testing in an experienced laboratory.\\nManagement\\nAwareness and early detection are important as occupationalasthma is the one area where appropriate management canaffect the natural course of the disease. The first approach tomanagement should be to try to adjust the conditions at workthat produced the sensitisation. If this is not possible thepatient may be able to continue working with a mask to providefiltered air. If these measures fail and simple inhaled treatmentis inadequate then a change of job will be necessary. It isadvisable to try to obtain, with the patient’s consent, thecooperation of any occupational health staff in the workplaceat an early stage.

About 2-3% of people with asthma have a history of sensitivity to aspirin, but around 20%have some sensitivity on provocation testing. Once such areaction has been noted these patients should avoid contactwith aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, whichusually produce the same effects. The mechanism is probablyrelated to changes in arachidonic acid metabolism withincreased production of leukotrienes. Milder salicylatesensitivity can be shown more often on routine testing,particularly in adults with asthma and nasal polyps.\\nIbuprofen is available without prescription and has the\\nsame effects. Patients are often unaware of the presence ofsalicylate in common compound preparations and cold cures.When salicylate sensitivity is suspected the patient should beasked to check carefully the contents of any such medicationthey take. When salicylate reactions occur it may be possible toinduce tolerance by carefully building up from small oral doses.This should be done only in experienced units.\\nIatrogenic effects\\nOccasionally, drugs used to treat asthma can themselves beresponsible for provoking bronchoconstriction.

It isparticularly important that patients know exactly what to doduring an acute exacerbation. More specific measures such asrelaxation, yoga, hypnotherapy, and acupuncture have beeninvestigated.

Though the inner city smogs disappeared afterthe introduction of the Clean Air Act 1956, high levels ofozone, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulatematter develop in certain areas and in particular climaticconditions. Combinations of high temperature, humidity, andheavy traffic can cause levels of these pollutants above those inthe guidelines of the World Health Organization. Increasedsymptoms and admissions have been linked to levels ofnitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide and, in some studies,ozone. High levels of small particulate matter are associatedwith increased mortality from cardiorespiratory diseases. Peoplewith asthma should be aware of measures of air quality.\\nWeather\\nClimatic conditions such as the pressure and humidityassociated with thunderstorms can provoke asthma.

Some\\nsevere episodes come on over a period of minutes with nowarning, although more often there is a background ofdeterioration over days or weeks. This period during whichcontrol of the asthma deteriorates tends to be longer in olderpatients. A good early guide to developing problems is theneed to use bronchodilator inhalers more often than usual orfinding that they are less effective.\\nPeak flow monitoring\\nDeterioration in control can also be detected by measurementof peak flow at home; a drop in the peak flow or an increase inthe diurnal variation of peak flow provides evidence ofinstability. Detecting these changes allows a change oftreatment while the decline is slow and before severe problemsarise. Even if patients do not use their peak flow meterregularly it can be useful to confirm changes in symptoms.\\nBreathlessness\\nThe most common symptom is breathlessness, and there ismore likely to be a sensation of difficulty in inspiration than inexpiration. Some patients have a poor appreciation of changesin the degree of their airflow obstruction and will complain offew symptoms until they have developed moderately severeasthma. They are more likely to develop severe asthma and areat particular risk during acute attacks. When such patients areidentified they should be encouraged to use a peak flow meterregularly to provide objective evidence of their asthma control.For these patients regular monitoring of peak flow isparticularly important. Some studies of patients who have hadlife threatening asthma show that patients with psychosocialproblems, poor adherence to treatment, and high levels ofdenial are over-represented compared with those with goodcontrol.\\nAs the severity of the asthma increases, breathlessness\\nbegins to interfere with simple functions. Exercise is limitedand later, eating and drinking are difficult. In severe attacks itwill be difficult for the patient to speak in full sentenceswithout gasping for breath between words. Knowledge of thepattern of previous attacks is important as the progress is oftenbroadly similar in subsequent episodes.\\nPatients must be taught to seek help early rather than late\\nin an acute exacerbation; it is easier to step in and preventdeterioration into severe asthma than to treat a full blownattack. Patients and their families should all be confident aboutthe management of exacerbations—not only regarding theimmediate treatment but also about how and when to seekfurther help and hospital admission. These should all bediscussed before the first acute attack of asthma.\\nExamination\\nInability to speak will be obvious when the history is taken.Respiratory rate is a useful sign and should be countedaccurately; a rate of /H1135025 breaths per minute is a sign of severity\\nHypoxia severe enough to cause confusion occurs only insevere asthma and means that admission to hospital andAssessment of severity in asthma\\nAlways err on the side of caution in assessment.

The pulse rate is\\nalso a useful guide to severity: tachycardia /H11022110 beats per\\nminute is found in severe episodes, though this sign may be lessreliable in elderly people, when pulse rates tend to remain low.In extremely severe attacks bradycardia may occur.\\nPulsus paradoxus (a drop in systolic pressure of /H1102210 mm\\nHg on inspiration) is a traditional measurement in acuteasthma but is not useful in practice. Any evidence of circulatoryembarrassment, such as hypotension, is an indication foradmission to hospital.\\nChest sounds\\nExamination of the chest itself shows a fast respiratory rate,overinflation, and wheezing. In severe acute asthma airflow maybe too little for an audible wheeze, so a quiet chest during anacute attack is worrying rather than reassuring. It may alsoindicate a pneumothorax (although these are not common in acute asthma, and they are difficult to diagnose clinically; a chest x ray film must be taken if there is any doubt).\\nPeak flow readings\\nIn severe attacks the peak flow rate may be unrecordable. Peakflow or FEV should be monitored throughout the attack andduring recovery as they are reliable, simple guides to theeffectiveness of treatment. Peak flow values are easier tointerpret if the patient’s usual or best readings are known.\\nBlood gases\\nAn initial measurement of blood gases should be done inpatients with asthma severe enough to warrant admission tohospital. Great care should be taken in obtaining arterial bloodbecause some asthmatic patients who have had bad experiencesof arterial puncture may delay attendance at hospital becauseof the memories of pain. In patients with mild attacks a pulseoximeter should be used in the accident and emergencydepartment. If saturation is /H1135093% while the patient is\\nbreathing air and he or she does not have signs of severeasthma, then blood gas measurement can be omitted. In moresevere cases oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter can be used toassess progress after the first arterial gas measurement,provided the initial carbon dioxide tension was not raised andthere is no sign of appreciable deterioration.\\nHypoxia and hypercapnia\\nSome hypoxia is usual and responds to supplemental oxygen.An arterial oxygen tension of /H113498 kPa on air is a mark of severity.\\nAs long as the patient does not have COPD there is no need tolimit the concentration of supplemental oxygen. The arterialcarbon dioxide tension is usually low in acute asthma;occasionally it is high on admission, particularly in children, butquickly responds to treatment with a bronchodilator.Hypercapnia, however, is an alarming feature of acute asthma,and failure either to reduce carbon dioxide retention duringthe first hour or to prevent its development during treatment isan indication that mechanical ventilation must be considered.The final decision on this depends on the overall clinical stateof the patient rather than on the blood gas measurement alone.\\nWhere to treat acute asthma\\nAn acute attack of asthma is frightening; transfer to hospitalmight exacerbate symptoms by producing anxiety, andreassurance that treatment is available to relieve the attack is animportant part of the management.

The threshold for admissionshould be lowered if there has been a recent admission,previous severe attacks, poor patient perception of severity, orpoor social support.\\nDangers of undertreatment\\nMost deaths from asthma occur when the patient or doctor hasfailed to appreciate the severity of the attack. When there is anydoubt it is safer to opt for vigorous treatment and admission tohospital.

The specific short acting /H9252\\n2agonists\\nsuch as salbutamol and terbutaline have replaced the earliernon-selective preparations for acute use. There are no greatdifferences in practice between the commonly used agents. Iflong acting bronchodilators are used they can be continuedduring the attack.\\nUse and availability of nebulisers\\nIn acute asthma, metered dose inhalers often lose theireffectiveness. This is largely because of difficulties in thedelivery of the drugs to the airways because of coordinationproblems and narrowing and occlusion of the airways.\\nAn alternative method of giving them is necessary—usually\\nby nebuliser or intravenously. A large volume spacer (forexample, Nebuhaler or Volumatic) can be as effective as anebuliser in most cases. Like the nebuliser it has the advantageof removing the need to coordinate inhaler actuation andbreathing. There is little or no difference in the effectiveness ofdrugs that are nebulised or given intravenously in acute severeasthma, so nebulisation is generally preferable.\\nIt is helpful for general practitioners to have nebulisers\\navailable for acute asthmatic attacks. In acute asthma, /H9252\\n2\\nagonists are best given by nebulisers driven by oxygen as theymay even worsen hypoxia slightly through an effect on thepulmonary vasculature. In general practice the use of oxygen asthe driving gas is not usually practical. Domiciliary oxygen setsdo not produce a flow rate adequate to drive most nebulisers,but, if available, they can be used with nasal cannulae duringthe nebulisation for a patient having an acute attack.

The driving gas, flow rate, drugdiluent, and volume of fill should be clearly written on theprescription chart. Dilutions should always be done with salineto avoid bronchoconstriction from nebulisation of hypotonicsolutions. There is no real advantage of nebulisation with a machine capable of producing intermittent positive pressure.\\nFor adults the initial dose should be 5 mg salbutamol or its\\nequivalent.

The\\ndose of ipratropium is 500 /H9262g, and there are no problems with\\nincreased viscosity of secretions or mucociliary clearance at suchdoses. Ipratropium starts working more slowly than salbutamol:the peak response may not occur for 30-60 minutes.\\nAdverse reactions such as paradoxical bronchoconstriction\\nhave been reported occasionally. These were related mainly tothe osmolality of the solution or to the preservatives, and theyhave been corrected in the current preparations.\\nAlthough the combination of /H9252stimulant and\\nanticholinergic agents produces a greater effect than use of asingle agent, the difference is small and /H9252\\n2agonists are\\nsufficient for most patients.

If the patient is seen at home andthen transferred to hospital the first dose of corticosteroidshould be given together with initial bronchodilator treatmentbefore the patient leaves home.\\nLength of steroid course\\nWhen intensive initial treatment has been requiredprednisolone should be maintained at 40 mg a day for at least aweek. Two to three weeks of treatment may be needed to obtainthe maximal response with deflation to normal lung volumesand loss of excessive diurnal variations of peak flow. Few sideeffects occur from such short courses of corticosteroids, but themost common ones are given in the adjacent box.\\nSteroids can be stopped abruptly after courses lasting up to\\nthree weeks. Tailing off the dose is not needed to preventadrenal suppression or helpful to prevent relapse, althoughmany patients are used to such regimens.\\nOxygen\\nAcute severe asthma is always associated with hypoxia, thoughcyanosis develops late and is a grave sign. Death in asthma iscaused by severe hypoxia; oxygen should be given as soon aspossible. It is unusual to provoke carbon dioxide retention withoxygen treatment in asthma, so oxygen should be given freelyduring transfer to hospital where blood gas measurement canbe made. Masks can provide 40-50% oxygen.\\nNebulisers should be driven by oxygen whenever possible.\\nIn older people with an exacerbation of COPD there is apotential danger of carbon dioxide retention. In these patientstreatment should begin with 24% or 28% oxygen by venturimask until the results of blood gas measurements are available.\\nMagnesium\\nIntravenous magnesium sulphate is effective and safe in acuteasthma. It is given as an infusion at a dose of 1.2-2.0 g over 20 minutes. It provides a possible additional therapy in acutesevere asthma in hospital when the initial response to nebulisedbronchodilators is inadequate.Adverse effects of short course of oral corticosteroids\\nGFluid retention\\nGHyperglycaemia\\nGIndigestion\\nGSleep disturbance\\nGSteroid induced psychosis\\nGSusceptibility to severe herpes zoster\\nGWeight gainABC of Asthma\\n30Fatal attacks of asthma are associated\\nwith failure to prescribe any or adequatedoses of corticosteroids\\nSide effects of short courses of corticosteroids\\nGIncreased appetite\\nGFluid retention\\nGGastrointestinal upset\\nGPsychological disturbance\\nExposure to herpes zoster may produce severe infections in\\nsusceptible individuals\\nSupplemental oxygen is a very important component of the treatment of\\nacute asthma.

Dehydration increases theviscosity of mucus, making plugging of the airways more likely,so intravenous fluid replacement is often necessary. Three litresshould be given during the first 24 hours if little oral fluid isbeing taken.\\nPotassium supplements\\nIncreased alveolar ventilation, sympathomimetic drugs, andcorticosteroids all tend to lower the serum potassiumconcentration. This is the most common disturbance ofelectrolytes in acute asthma; the serum potassium concentrationshould be monitored and supplements given as necessary.\\nAntibiotics\\nUpper respiratory tract infections are the most common triggerfactors for acute asthma and most of these are viral. In only afew cases are exacerbations of asthma precipitated by bacterialinfection.\\nThere is no evidence of benefit from the routine use of\\nantibiotics. They should be reserved for patients in whom thereis presumptive evidence of infection—such as fever, neutrophilsin the blood or sputum, or radiological changes. Although allthese features may occur in acute attacks without bacterialinfection, an antibiotic such as amoxycillin, doxycycline, orerythromycin would be appropriate.\\nControlled ventilation\\nPatients with acute severe asthma who need hospital admissionshould be treated in an area able to deal with acute medicalemergencies, with adequate nursing and medical supervision. If hypoxia is worsening, hypercapnia is present, or patients areexhausted or drowsy, then they should be nursed in anintensive care unit.\\nOccasionally, mechanical ventilation may be necessary for a\\nshort time while the treatment takes effect. It is usually neededbecause the patient becomes exhausted; experience and carefulobservation are necessary to judge the right time to beginventilatory support. Unlike in patients with COPD andrestrictive lung disease, non-invasive ventilation is not usuallyappropriate in acute asthma, though it may occasionally betried in expert hands in an intensive care unit.\\nHigh inflation pressures and long expiratory times may make\\nventilation difficult, but most experienced units have good resultsprovided that the decision to ventilate the patient is madeelectively and is not precipitated by respiratory arrest. Whenpatients being mechanically ventilated fail to improve on adequatetreatment, bronchial lavage may occasionally be considered toreopen airways that have become plugged by mucus. In extremelysevere unresponsive cases other treatments such as inhalationalanaesthetics may be helpful, or a mixture of helium and oxygenmay improve airflow while other treatment takes effect.\\nOther factors\\nMost patients with acute severe asthma improve with thesemeasures.

In the UK those produced by theBritish Thoracic Society and the Scottish IntercollegiateGuidelines Network, Asthma UK, and the Royal College ofPhysicians in association with accident and emergency, primarycare, and paediatric groups have had wide distribution andacceptance. They were published in 2003 and updated in 2004.The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA, www.ginasthma.com)also produces valuable guidelines and resources.\\nGuidelines are most likely to influence behaviour when they\\nare adapted to local needs in hospital or practice and endorsedby a local respected enthusiast. They should be accompanied byregular audit against the agreed parts of the guidelines. Most ofthe published guidelines are in broad agreement on thestrategy for managing chronic asthma.\\nIn the UK the general practitioner contract allows practices\\nto earn points related to organisation of asthma management.\\nGeneral features\\nAs a preliminary step in all patients with asthma, obviousprecipitating factors should be sought and avoided whenpracticable. This is possible for specific allergens such asanimals and foods but more difficult with widespread allergenssuch as pollens and house dust mites. A common non-specificstimulus is cigarette smoking. Up to a fifth of asthmaticscontinue to smoke; strenuous efforts should be made todiscourage smoking in them and their families. Precipitatingfactors should be carefully explored on one of the first visits,but they should also be reassessed periodically.\\nPatients with asthma often look for a cure. It is important to\\nestablish early on that cure is not possible but if patients acceptthe need for regular treatment most can be virtually free fromsymptoms. Fortunately, most patients can achieve such controlwith safe drug treatment, with minimal or no side effects.Unfortunately, however, many patients with mild asthma fail toachieve this. Education in understanding the disease andtreatment is often helped by home peak flow recording andwritten explanations of the purpose and practical details oftreatment. In particular, the differences between symptomaticbronchodilator treatment and regular maintenance treatmentmust be emphasised. It is all too common to find asthmaticpatients using their dose of inhaled steroid only to treat anacute attack. In general practice and in hospital, nurses providea vital element in the management of asthma.\\nInhaler technique and understanding of and adherence to\\nmanagement plans should be checked regularly, particularlywhen control is not adequate and stepping up treatment isbeing considered.\\nAsthma clinics\\nMany hospitals have concentrated their patients into specificasthma clinics for some years.

Local and national training\\ncourses are available for nurses who take on such clinics—forexample, the National Respiratory Training Centre in Warwick.The clinics can be used to audit the treatment of asthmaticpatients in a practice and to ensure that all patients areencouraged to participate in their optimal management.\\nAsthma clinics in general practice are best if they work with\\nclearly written management guidelines and care plans. In somepractices they are run by doctors but in most cases they are runby nurses, who have more time to spend with each individualpatient to go through inhaler techniques, understanding, andmanagement plans. An interested doctor should be available forconsultation, and a close liaison should be built up with chestphysicians at the local hospital. Every patient should have apersonal management plan and be reviewed at least once a year.\\nAims of management\\nPersistent inflammation of the airways and increased bronchialreactivity have been recognised even in mild intermittentasthma. Drugs such as inhaled corticosteroids, which reducebronchial hyperresponsiveness, symptoms, and inflammatoryinfiltration of the airway, can target the inflammation. There hasbeen a general move to more aggressive treatment of asthma, thegoal being freedom from symptoms rather than tolerance ofshortness of breath and frequent need of bronchodilators. Oncecontrol is achieved the regimen is usually maintained for three tosix months before the treatment is stepped down.\\nDrug regimens\\nRoutine regular use of short acting bronchodilators should beavoided. They should be used to treat symptoms, and their useshould be limited by the use of prophylactic agents. Thisapproach fits with the various sets of guidelines published overthe past few years.\\nRegular inhaled corticosteroids decrease reactivity, as do\\nleukotriene receptor antagonists and (probably) sodiumcromoglicate and nedocromil sodium. Studies of mild asthmashow that regular use of prophylactic agents reducesinflammation of the airways. The hope is that the reduction inthe inflammation will prevent damage to the airway that wouldotherwise go on to produce irreversible obstruction. There isstill no convincing long term evidence for this, nor is thereconvincing evidence that inhaled steroids change the naturalcourse of asthma in any other way. Reactivity is improved butdoes not return to normal and reverts to pre-treatment levelswhen steroids are stopped. Leukotriene receptor antagonistshave shown evidence of an anti-inflammatory action in additionto bronchodilatation.\\nMild episodes of wheezing occurring once or twice a month\\ncan be controlled with inhaled /H9252\\n2agonists. When attacks are\\nmore frequent regular treatment with anti-inflammatory agentis necessary. Patients with lack of adequate control should beasked about sensitivity to irritants such as dust and smoke, nighttime symptoms, and peak flow recording. Definite diurnalvariation on peak flow readings or nocturnal waking indicates ahigh degree of reactivity of the airways and the need forvigorous treatment. When chronic symptoms persist in the faceof appropriate inhaled treatment a short course of oralcorticosteroids often produces improvement, which may last formany months after the course.\\nLong acting inhaled /H9252\\n2agonists are good at controlling\\nsymptoms.

They start to workquickly—salbutamol and terbutaline take effect within 15 minutes and last for four to six hours. There is no clearthreshold for all patients, but if there has been an exacerbationof asthma in the past two years, if inhaled /H9252\\n2agonists are\\nneeded three times a week or more, or if symptoms are presentthree times a week or waking one night a week, then additionaltreatment must be considered. The dose response varies amongpatients as does the dose that will produce side effects, such astremor. Patients should be taught to monitor their inhaler useand to understand that if they need it more, or if its effectslessen, these are danger signals. They indicate deterioration incontrol and the need for further treatment.\\nAdverse effects\\nSome patients worry that /H92522agonists may become slightly less\\neffective with time, particularly if the dose is high. There is littleevidence of appreciable tachyphylaxis for the airway effects inasthmatics. If it exists, it is minor and is quickly reversed bystopping the treatment temporarily or by taking corticosteroids.Tremor, palpitations, and muscle cramps may occur but arerarely troublesome if the drug is inhaled; these adverse effectsoften become less of a problem with continued treatment.\\nSome studies found that regular use of /H9252\\n2agonists was\\nassociated with increased bronchial reactivity, worseningcontrol of asthma, and accelerated decline of lung function.These have not been confirmed, and when the standardguidelines are followed, /H9252\\n2agonists are not used regularly\\nunless they are needed for control of symptoms.\\nLong acting /H9252agonists\\nThe long acting inhaled /H92522agonists salmeterol and formoterol\\nhave had an increasing role in treatment since the early 1990s.The mechanism of the prolonged action is different in the twodrugs and the onset of bronchodilatation is faster withformoterol, but in other ways most physicians regard them asequivalent. Choice depends more on the device required thanthe drug itself. They are particularly effective for nocturnal andexercise induced asthma. The British guidelines now placethem as a first option at “step 3,” when a low to moderate doseof inhaled corticosteroids (400-800 /H9262g beclometasone or\\nequivalent) fails to establish symptom-free control.\\nSeveral studies have shown that salmeterol and formoterol\\nare is more effective than doubling the intake of inhaledcorticosteroids in controlling symptoms and increasing peakflow. The effect is maintained over six months in such studies.A comparison of low and high dose inhaled steroids over 12 months, with or without formoterol, showed that increasingsteroids and addition of formoterol reduced exacerbations.Severe exacerbations, defined by the need for oral steroids orpeak flow drop, were prevented more effectively by higher dosesteroids than formoterol, but best of all by the combination.Formoterol with steroids was the most effective in symptomreduction and peak flow control. Remember, long acting /H9252\\nagonists are bronchodilators and do not suppress inflammation.\\n369 Treatment of chronic asthma\\nIncreases in cyclic AMP lead to bronchodilatation and may be produced by\\n/H92522receptor stimulation or phosphodiesterase inhibition\\nMonthFEV1 percentage predicted\\n-1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12758590\\n80High budesonide\\nLow budesonide+ formoterol\\n+ formoterol\\nEffect of formoterol with and without a corticosteroid.

Its safety margin is lower thanother inhalational bronchodilators. Individual differences inthe doses required are high so it is necessary to monitortreatment by blood concentrations. Inhaled treatment with /H9252agonists is preferable, but slow release theophyllines are an\\nalternative to long acting /H9252agonists for nocturnal symptoms.\\nAbsorption of aminophylline from suppositories is much lesspredictable, and they are best avoided.\\nAdverse effects\\nThe starting dose of theophylline should be around7 mg/kg/day in divided doses and should then be built up. Allpatients taking theophylline should have their serumconcentrations monitored and doses adjusted until they arebetween 8 and 18 mg/l (40-90 /H9262mol/l) for optimal\\nbronchodilator effect. Above 20 mg/l toxic effects areunacceptably high, though gastrointestinal effects are commonat lower concentrations.\\nSmoking, alcohol consumption, and enzyme-inducing drugs\\nsuch as phenytoin, rifampicin, and barbiturates increasetheophylline clearance (p.29).

There isstill little reason to use it, however, unless patients will not takeinhaled steroids.\\nInhaled corticosteroids\\nInhaled corticosteroids are the most effective preventativetreatment in asthma. Steroids may be given by metered doseinhaler, dry powder devices, or nebuliser, and the dose shouldbe adjusted to give optimum control. Two common inhaledsteroids—beclometasone dipropionate and budesonide—areroughly equivalent in dose, while fluticasone has the sameeffect at half the dose.\\nMethod of delivery\\nThe formulation and delivery device must also be considered.The non-CFC beclometasone metered dose inhaler QVar has asmall particle size and increased lung deposition. The dose ofbeclometasone can be halved when the patient is switched fromanother preparation. Much of the benefit of inhaledcorticosteroids is seen at low to moderate doses up to 400-800 /H9262g beclometasone. There is some further effect with\\nhigher doses but the dose response above 800 /H9262g\\nbeclometasone or 500 /H9262g fluticasone becomes flatter.\\nAdverse effects\\nIn adults there are no problems, apart from occasionaloropharyngeal candidiasis or a husky voice, until a daily doseabove the equivalent of 1000 /H9262g beclometasone dipropionate is\\nreached. At higher doses there may be biochemical evidence ofsuppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, evenwith inhaled steroids. Much of the systemic effect comes fromabsorption from the lung itself, bypassing the metabolicpathways of the gut and liver that limit any problems from drugdeposited in the mouth and swallowed.\\nWith doses of more than 1000 /H9262g daily of budesonide or\\nbeclometasone there are metabolic effects, including anincrease in the concentration of osteocalcin, a marker ofincreased bone turnover. There is some evidence of skinthinning and purpura, even in patients who have not hadappreciable doses of oral steroids.

These problems may be increased by the use ofinhaled corticosteroids earlier in the course of asthma and toachieve total control free of symptoms. Combination with longacting bronchodilators may improve adherence as loss ofbronchodilator effect will be noticed more quickly if therapy isdiscontinued.\\nDosage reduction\\nThere seems to be no advantage in starting a high dose toachieve quicker control. The starting dose should match theseverity of the asthma, and moderate doses are usuallyadequate and appropriate. When asthma is controlled the nextdecision is how long to maintain the inhaled steroids. The doseshould be reviewed regularly, particularly at doses /H110221000 /H9262g\\ndaily. Control should be established for three months beforethe dose is reduced by 25-50%, though more flexible regimensto match the dose to symptoms are also used.\\nOral corticosteroids\\nShort courses of oral steroids are often necessary for acuteexacerbations and have few serious problems. Some patientshave to take long term oral corticosteroids but this should beonly after vigorous treatment with other drugs has failed. Thesymptoms or risks of the disease must be balanced against theadverse effects of long term treatment with oral corticosteroids.\\nLength of treatment\\nShort courses of oral steroids may be stopped abruptly or tailedoff over a few days. Low concentrations of cortisol andadrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) are found for just twoto three days after 40 mg prednisolone daily for three weeks, butclinical problems with responses to stress or exacerbations ofasthma do not occur. An appropriate course would be 30-50 mgprednisolone daily for a minimum of five days and usually up to14 days until baseline function returns. Most patients can betaught to keep such a supply of steroids at home and to usethem according to their individual management plan whenpredetermined signs of deteriorating control occur.\\nIf patients require long term oral steroids, they should be\\nsettled on a regimen of treatment on alternate days wheneverpossible. The goal is always to establish control with othertreatments so that the oral steroids can be discontinued. Inhaledsteroids in moderate to high doses should be maintained tokeep the oral dose as low as possible. Alternative preparationssuch as ACTH and triamcinolone are less flexible and give noappreciable benefit in terms of adrenal suppression.\\nAdverse effects\\nWhen patients are on long term oral steroids or take shortcourses more than three times a year the risks of osteoporosisshould be considered.

More common are patients withreactive airways who are also sensitive to pollens, house dustmite, and other allergens.

Most will use these alongsideconventional treatment but may not inform their medicalcarers, particularly if they appear dismissive of such treatments.The dangers come when alternative treatments are used insteadof standard treatments. Controlled trials are more difficult inthis area, and there are few examples of scientifically valid trialsof adequate size and duration.

With the range of devices available nearly all patients cantake drugs by inhalation. All the available devices usedappropriately can provide adequate drug to the airways.Inhalers should not be prescribed without checking that thepatient can use the device satisfactorily. This should berechecked on subsequent visits as errors can develop andinterfere with treatment. Some drugs, such as leukotrienereceptor antagonists and theophylline, cannot be given byinhalation.\\nMetered dose inhalers\\nInhalers deliver the drug directly to the airways. Even when ametered dose inhaler (MDI) is used properly, however, onlyabout 10% of the drug reaches the airways below the larynx.Nearly all the rest of the drug gets no further than theoropharynx and is swallowed. This swallowed portion may beabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but drugs such asinhaled corticosteroids are largely removed by first passmetabolism in the liver. Absorption directly from the lungbypasses liver metabolism.\\nAn MDI should be shaken and then fired into the mouth\\nshortly after the start of a slow full inspiration. At full inflationthe breath should be held for 10 seconds. The techniqueshould be checked periodically. About a quarter of patientshave difficulty using a metered dose inhaler and the problemsincrease with age. Arthritic patients can find it hard to activatethe inhaler and may be helped by a Haleraid device, whichresponds to squeezing, or be given a breath actuated or drypowder system.\\nBreath actuated aerosol inhalers\\nBreath actuated MDIs are available for most classes of drug.The valve on the inhaler is actuated as the patient breathes in.The devices respond to a low inspiratory flow rate and areuseful for those who have difficulty coordinating actuation andbreathing. They require a propellant similar to that found in astandard inhaler.\\nCFC-free inhalers\\nMany current MDIs have moved from chlorofluorocarbon(CFC) propellants. The production, importation, and use ofCFCs have been stopped in most developed countries becauseof the effect on the ozone layer. There is a temporaryexemption for medical use under the Montreal Protocol, butCFC inhalers will be removed once adequate non-CFC productsbecome available.\\nAlternative propellants\\nThe challenge has been to develop safe alternatives that are asconvenient, effective, and clinically equivalent. The process ofdevelopment of alternative propellants has been more of aproblem than first appreciated, particularly for inhaled steroids.Adaptations to the method of adding the drug to the propellantand to the valve and jet mechanisms have been necessary.50-60% recoverable\\nfrom the mouth andpharynx by washing\\n>90%\\nswallowedInhaler\\n<10% reaches \\nthe lungs\\nInhalers deliver the drug direct to the airways\\nMetering chamber\\nMetering valve\\nActuator orifice\\nOpening for emptying \\nof metering chamber\\nThe mechanisms inside a metered dose inhaler\\nElderly patients may find using a metered dose inhaler\\ndifficult (3M United Kingdom plc)', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/ABC of Asthma.pdf', 'page': 49}),\n"," Document(page_content='Use of spacer devices\\nGMatch the MDI and spacer\\nGInhale as soon as possible after each single\\nactuation\\nGEmpty the chamber by single large breaths or\\ntidal breathing\\nGClean chamber monthly\\nGWash chamber in detergent and water and leave\\nto dry\\nGWipe any detergent from mouthpiece\\nGReplace spacer every 6-12 monthsABC of Asthma\\n44Hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs) 134 and 227 are used in the new\\ndevices.\\nShort and long acting /H9252agonists, inhaled steroids, and\\ncombinations are now available in inhalers withhydrofluoroalkanes. Each new device has to be tested carefullyas total and regional delivery to the lung will differ with thenew devices. The beclometasone product QVar is prescribed athalf the dose of a conventional MDI because of its better lungdeposition. Other preparations can be substituted at the samedose. Patients will notice differences in the speed of the aerosolcloud and taste.\\nThe switch to CFC-free MDIs should be taken as an\\nopportunity to review the patient’s understanding and inhalertechnique and general asthma management.\\nSpacer devices\\nThe coordination of firing and inspiration becomes slightly lessimportant when a short extension tube or spacer is used. Thismay help if problems are minor, and a larger reservoir removesthe need for coordination of breathing and actuation. Theinhaler is fixed into the chamber and the breath is takenthrough a one way valve at the other end of the chamber.Inhalation should be as soon as possible after each actuation,certainly within 30 seconds, and tidal breathing is as effective asdeep breaths.\\nPharyngeal deposition is greatly reduced as the faster\\nparticles strike the walls of the chamber, not the mouth.Evaporation of propellant from the larger, slower particlesproduces a small sized aerosol that penetrates further out intothe lungs and deposits a greater proportion of drug beyond thelarynx. This reduces the risk of oral candidiasis and dysphoniawith inhaled corticosteroids and reduces potential problemswith systemic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Theyshould be used routinely when doses of inhaled steroid of/H11022800/H9262g daily are given by metered dose inhaler.\\nThe device is cumbersome, but this is no great disadvantage\\nfor twice daily treatment such as corticosteroids. Chambershave proved useful as a substitute for a nebuliser in acuteasthma. Output characteristics of MDIs vary, and inhalers andextension tubes need to be matched appropriately. It cannot beassumed that results transfer to different combinations.\\nElectrostatic charge can reduce drug delivery. Chambers\\nshould be washed in detergent and left to air dry (rather thanwiped dry) once a month and changed every 6–12 months.Metal chambers without static charge can also be used.\\nDry powder inhalers\\nDry powder inhalers of various types are available for /H9252\\nagonists, sodium cromoglicate, corticosteroids, anticholinergicagents, and combinations. Because inspiratory airflow releasesthe fine powder many problems of coordination are avoided,and there are none of the environmental worries of metereddose inhalers. The dry powder makes some patients cough, andthe respiratory flow rate needed may be a problem with somedevices in asthma. The problems of reloading for each dosehave been eased by the development of multiple dose unitswith up to 200 doses and many devices have a dose counter thathelps the patient to know when the inhaler needs renewingand provides a compliance monitor.\\nSome dry powder devices such as the Turbohaler increase\\nlung deposition and may allow a reduction in the prescribeddose.\\nThe Accuhaler has a convenient dose counterOne way valve Metered dose inhalerSpray output Clear plastic\\nAn extension tube (spacer) used with a metered dose inhaler.

Theyprovide a way of giving inhaled drugs to those unable to useany other device—for example, the very young—or in acuteattacks when inspiratory flow is limited.\\nNebulisers also offer a convenient way of delivering a\\nhigher dose to the airways. Generally, about 12% of the drugleaving the chamber enters the lungs, but most of the dose staysin the apparatus or is wasted in expiration. Delivery dependson the type of nebuliser chamber, the flow rate at which it isdriven, and the volume in the chamber. In most cases flow ratesof less than 6 l/min in a jet nebuliser give too large a particleand nebulise too slowly. Some chambers have a reservoir andvalve system to reduce loss to the surrounding room duringexpiration.\\nIn many situations equivalent effects can be obtained with\\nMDI and a spacer but patients often have confidence in theirnebuliser.\\nTablets and syrups\\nTablets and syrups are available for oral use.

Slow release tablets are used when a prolongedaction is needed, particularly for nocturnal asthma in whichtheophyllines have proved helpful.

Labelling achild as asthmatic can still cause anxiety within the family andcontroversy among paediatricians. Alternative diagnoses such aswheezy bronchitis or allergic airways disease, however, probablyhinder clinicians in their approach to management of asthma.\\nPresenting symptoms\\nFor most practising paediatricians and general practitioners, apreschool child with recurrent wheezy episodes whose wheezedisappears after treatment with a bronchodilator probablyjustifies a clinical diagnosis of asthma (on the understandingthat this term has no implication for long term prognosis orunderlying pathology). For example, respiratory syncitial virus(RSV) bronchiolitis itself causes wheezing and up to half ofaffected children will go on to develop recurrent episodicwheeze. Many children have mild wheezing during viralinfections (virus associated wheeze), but their prognosis is betterthan children who have wheeze without a viral infection. Inaddition, the airways of children in the first two to three years oflife (that is, preschool children) are small relative to the size ofthe lungs. The airways and chest walls are less rigid, so duringexpiration they are more likely than those of older children tocollapse or become obstructed by secretions or mucosal changesthat are not the result of an inflammatory process like asthma.\\nOlder children can describe symptoms of cough, wheeze,\\ndyspnoea, and chest tightness, and whether there is animprovement with bronchodilator and steroid therapy. Inaddition, peak flow measurements, FEV\\n1by spirometry, exercise\\ntesting, and recordings of diurnal variations will assist diagnosis.\\nThus in paediatric practice, in the absence of an easily\\nrecognised diagnostic marker, a clinical diagnosis of asthmausually relies on a combination of history of characteristicsymptoms, evidence of airway lability, and, in particular, areduction in symptoms after treatment with a short acting /H9252\\n2\\nagonist showing reversible airflow obstruction.\\nPrevalence of asthma\\nAsthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood.About 1 in 6 (17%) or more children aged between 2 and 15 inthe UK have asthma symptoms that require treatment.\\nIs prevalence increasing or reaching a plateau?\\nWhile several epidemiological studies show that the prevalenceof asthma and other atopic disorders such as eczema and hayfever is increasing in many countries throughout the world,more recent studies indicate that, perhaps in the Western worldat least, prevalence rates are reaching a plateau.\\nThe observation that all forms of allergic disease are\\nincreasing simultaneously suggests an increase in hostsusceptibility, rather than a rise in allergic sensitisation.Associations between the prevalence of asthma and small familysize, affluence, and BCG status (decreased asthma with BCGvaccine) are all recognised and, coupled with our understandingThe International Consensus Report on the Diagnosis and\\nManagement of Asthma gives the following definition: “Asthma is achronic inflammatory disorder of the airway in which many cellsplay a role, in particular mast cells, eosinophils, and T lymphocytes.In susceptible individuals this inflammation causes recurrentepisodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughparticularly at night and or in the early morning. These symptomsare usually associated with widespread but variable airflowlimitation that is at least partly reversible either spontaneously orwith treatment. The inflammation also causes an associated\\nincrease in airway responsiveness to a variety of stimuli.”\\nIn the UK about 1.6 million children\\naged 2-15 have asthma symptoms thatrequire treatmentInfant\\n0.4 mmAdult\\n0.7 mm\\nComparative diameters of bronchioles in infant and adult\\nA definition of asthma', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/ABC of Asthma.pdf', 'page': 52}),\n"," Document(page_content='of the immunology of asthma, hint at the possibility of factors\\neither in utero or in early life that might modify an individual’satopic tendency.\\nThe ISAAC study suggested that asthma prevalence was not\\ndirectly related to air pollution. Regions such as China andEastern Europe, with high levels of particulate matter andsulphur dioxide pollution, had low rates of asthma, whereasWestern Europe and the US, with high levels of ozone, had anintermediate prevalence of asthma. Centres with the lowestlevels of air pollution, such as New Zealand, had a highprevalence of asthma.\\nThe International Study Asthma and Allergies in Childhood\\n(ISAAC) attempted to identify further important environmentalrisk factors in the pathogenesis of asthma and related atopicdisorders, being a population based study spanning 56 countrieswith 155 centres taking part. Nearly half a million children aged 13-14 completed a written questionnaire on symptoms of asthma,allergic conjunctivitis, and atopic eczema; over 300 000 completeda video questionnaire. The highest prevalence asthma symptomswas from the UK, New Zealand, and Australia, with a consistentlyhigh prevalence of other atopic disorders such as eczema and \\nhay fever\\nPublic health issues\\nIn terms of burden of disease, childhood asthma presents a\\nserious public health problem. More than half of all cases ofasthma present before the age of 10, and over 30% of childrenexperience a wheezing illness during the first few years of life.More absence from school is caused by asthma than any otherchronic condition; 30% of asthmatic children miss more thanthree weeks of schooling each year. Asthma influenceseducational attainment even in children of above averageintelligence, the extent of this adverse effect being related toseverity of the disease.\\nReasons for the increasing \\nprevalence\\nIt is unlikely that there is a single cause and effect association\\nto account for the rise in prevalence of asthma and atopicdisorders. Recent immunological studies, however, haveindicated that the first three years of life (including life beforebirth) are probably the most critical in terms of environmentalinfluences on the development of the asthma phenotype. Forexample, there are strong links between cigarette smoking inpregnancy and narrow airways in the offspring, and the risk ofa child developing asthma is more closely associated withallergy in the mother than in the father.\\nChanges such as those in housing that allow proliferation of\\nhouse dust mite, the effects of outdoor and indoor pollutantssuch as cigarette smoke, dietary changes, and low birth weightand prematurity may all account for some of the increasedprevalence. To account for the increase in disease prevalencefrom 10% to 15% (such as has occurred in the UK over thepast 30 years), however, the proportion of the populationexposed to these hazards would need to have increased from10% to nearly 70%, suggesting that other, as yet unidentified,risk factors may be operating.\\nThe relevance of atopy\\nAtopy, defined as the predisposition to raise specific IgE tocommon allergens, is probably the single strongest risk factorfor asthma, carrying up to a 20-fold increased risk of asthma inatopic individuals compared with non-atopic individuals.

The fetal immune system is primarilypolarised towards a Th2 response as a result of interleukin 4and 10 (IL-4 and IL-10) production by the placenta.Furthermore, T lymphocytes isolated from cord blood ofnewborn babies of atopic mothers are able to respond toaeroallergens, suggesting that they may have been exposed toantigens ingested by the mother and transferred across theplacenta in the third trimester of pregnancy.\\nDuring early childhood, environmental allergens—in\\nparticular intestinal microflora—are thought to influence theimmune deviation of T helper cells towards the Th1 type in non-atopic children and towards the Th2 type in atopic children. Inatopic children with recurrent wheezing illness, bronchoalveolarlavage studies indicate increased mast cell and eosinophilconcentrations in children as young as 3. Up to the age of 10,the peripheral blood mononuclear cell response to specificstimulation in children who develop atopic disease is deficient inits capacity to generate interferon gamma, thereby causingupregulation of Th2 responses and an allergic phenotype.\\nEarly exposure to infections\\nThe “hygiene hypothesis” argues that the increase in asthma isdue to a decrease in exposure to infection in early life.Frequent infections in childhood generate Th1 cytokines suchas the interleukins IL-12, IL-18, and interferon gamma, andthese in turn inhibit the growth of Th2 cells, thus preventingdevelopment of the asthma phenotype. The hypothesis wouldalso explain the inverse association between socioeconomicstatus and asthma and allergy, with the assumption thatchildren from higher social classes are exposed to fewerinfections in early life. It may also explain why firstbornchildren have a higher prevalence of asthma, as they would beexposed to fewer infections from siblings.\\nProspects for prevention\\nAllergen avoidance studies—such as the Isle of Wight study, inwhich infants born to mothers with a strong family history ofatopy were randomised to receive prophylaxis with the mothereating a hypoallergenic diet and breast feeding or giving a soyamilk preparation to their babies—showed a significant decreasein the prevalence of eczema and reactions to skin prick tests toaeroallergens and dietary factors, but no sustained benefit inrelation to reduction in asthma.\\nOther similar studies focusing on dietary manipulation to\\nprevent atopic eczema have shown equivocal results, but breastfeeding is still advised in children from atopic families or inbabies identified by high concentration of IgE in cord blood.Breastfeeding mothers are also advised to avoid allergens towhich they are sensitive.\\nThese results seem to indicate that the development of\\nasthma is a combination of genetic susceptibility and exposurein early life to allergic stimuli and pollutants that augment aTh2 immune response. Once the asthma is established, cycles ofacute and chronic inflammation triggered by allergens, viruses,pollutants, diet, and stress are responsible for exacerbations.\\nRecent studies indicate that the rise in childhood obesity\\nmay also be linked with the rise in childhood asthma.

Once asthma isestablished, however, T cells and eosinophil responses may haveenhanced capacity to generate the leukotrienes IL-3, IL-4, andIL-5, and it may be more difficult to reverse an established Th2response. In this situation, secondary prevention measures toreduce exposure to trigger factors are appropriate.\\nTrigger factors in asthma\\nGViral infections\\nGDusts and pollutants including cigarette smoke\\nGAllergens—for example, house dust mite, pollens, moulds,\\nspores, animal dander and feathers, certain foods, Alternaria in\\ndry arid conditions\\nGExercise\\nGChanges in weather patterns and cold air\\nGPsychological factors such as stress and emotion\\nTrigger factors in asthma\\nDuring the preschool years viral infections, exercise, and\\nemotional upset are all common triggers of asthma. Youngchildren contract six to eight viral upper respiratory tractinfections each year so it is not surprising that these infections aremore common precipitants of asthma in children than in adults.Asthmatic children tend to have more symptoms during the winterthan the summer, probably because viral respiratory infections aremore common in winter and because exercise induced asthma ismore likely to develop outdoors in cold weather.\\nThe domestic environment\\nIf asthmatic children are sensitised to house dust mite parentscan reduce exposure by removing carpets or vacuum cleaningregularly and dusting surfaces with damp cloths, as well asencasing mattresses and pillows in plastic sheets, washingcovers, blankets, duvets, and furry toys regularly, and applyingacaricides to soft furnishings. A recent Cochrane review,however, suggests that chemical and physical measures toreduce house dust mite cannot be recommended on the basisof the evidence available.\\nSmoking\\nTobacco smoke has consistently been found to triggerexacerbation of asthma in children, and families should beencouraged to stop smoking or smoke in areas away fromchildren outside the house. In addition, in families with astrong family history of asthma, and in children exposed tomaternal smoking during pregnancy, there is a fourfold risk ofdeveloping wheezing illnesses in young children.\\nAir pollution\\nEpidemiological studies have suggested that certain types ofoutdoor air pollution (sulphur dioxide and high dieselparticulates) may provoke emergency admissions for asthma oraggravate existing chronic asthma.Definition, prevalence, and prevention\\n49\\nElectron micrograph of pollen grains.

Researchers have differentiated earlytransient wheezers from persistent wheezers by analysis of riskfactors and lung function tests. The transient wheezers hadsmaller airways and their mothers smoked, whereas thepersistent wheezers had a more classic atopic history with apositive family history of maternal asthma, raised serum IgE,and positive results to skin prick tests.\\nRespiratory tract infections\\nMany babies have repeated episodes of wheezing associatedwith viral respiratory tract infections. The mechanism by whichthis happens is still not fully understood, but geneticconstitution and environmental influences in early life maypredispose to wheeze by causing changes in airway calibre or inlung function. For example, wheezy lower respiratory illnessesare more common among boys, among infants of parents whosmoke, and among babies born prematurely who have neededprolonged positive pressure ventilation. Thus pre-existingfactors other than asthma that cause narrowing of the airwaysaccount for more than half of the wheezing developed byinfants.\\nBronchiolitis\\nAbout 1% of infants are admitted to hospital with acute viralbronchiolitis. Recurrent cough and wheezing commonly followbut in most cases stop before school age. About 40% of babieswith atopic eczema also develop recurrent wheezing, and thereis a strong association between a family history of atopic diseaseand wheezing in early childhood. According to data fromMartinez and colleagues (see box) 14% of children hadpersistent wheezing from infancy to the age of 6 (persistentwheezers), and this group also had the highest proportion ofviral respiratory disease in the first year of life, suggesting thatsome viral infections may facilitate the development of asthma,whereas others (as discussed in chapter 11) may help to modifythe immune response in such a way as to protect againstasthma.\\nProgression of asthma from\\nchildhood to adolescence\\nThe outcome of early onset wheeze is still controversial.\\nChildren seen in referral centres have poorer outcomes thanthose followed up in longitudinal studies of generalpopulations, probably because those with more severe asthmaare referred to hospital.\\nPredictability\\nThe data from Martinez and colleagues would suggest that earlyonset asthma is associated with poor outcome in terms of lungfunction and persistent bronchial hyperresponsiveness.Another study in infants aged 1 month showed that those whowere more responsive to histamine challenge were more likelyto have asthma diagnosed at the age of 6, and other studieshave shown a clear relation between degree of airwayA prospective study by Martinez and colleagues in 1995 looked at\\nover 1200 children born in Tucson, Arizona. By the age of 6, 826children (51%) had never wheezed. Three patterns were identifiedin the others: 20% of children who had wheezed early on withrespiratory tract infections had no wheezing by the age of 6 (earlytransient group), 15% had no wheezing at the age of 3 but hadwheezing at the age of 6 (late onset group), and 14% had wheezing\\nbefore the age of 3 and at the age of 6 (persistent wheezers)\\nAbout 1% of infants will be admitted to hospital with acute viral\\nbronchiolitis\\nWith permission from Mark Clarke/Science Photo Library', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/ABC of Asthma.pdf', 'page': 57}),\n"," Document(page_content='ABC of Asthma\\n52hyperresponsiveness to histamine challenge and persistence of\\nasthma.\\nIn a review of patients aged 29-32 who had previously been\\nstudied at the age of 7 by questionnaire and spirometry,however, Jenkins and colleagues found that of those who hadreported asthma at age 7, only 26% still had symptoms asadults. Other childhood risk factors that predicted asthma inadult life included being female, a family history of asthma,and more severe asthma (especially if it developed after the ageof 2 and was associated with reduced expiratory flow rate).\\nA population study in New Zealand reported that as\\nchildren grow older bronchial hyperreactivity decreases. Judgedby the response to inhaled histamine, the number of childrenwith hyperresponsive airways halved between the ages of 6 and12. In contrast, the total number of children with atopydoubled. Of those aged 5-7 who had evidence of bronchialreactivity, about half were atopic; of the children aged 13 withbronchial hyperresponsiveness over 90% were atopic.\\nResults of studies\\nThese results support the clinical observations that non-specificfactors—notably viral infections and exercise—are importanttriggers of asthma during preschool years, and allergic triggersassume greater importance as children grow older. Other similarlongitudinal studies suggest that children with mild diseaseusually outgrow their asthma as a result of the increase in airwaysize with growth and the apparent spontaneous decline in airwayresponsiveness with age. However, females and those with moresevere disease, greater airway hyperresponsiveness, and an atopichistory tend to have more persistent disease.\\nTeenagers with asthma\\nAsthmatic teenagers are coping with a period of intenseemotional and psychological change, and this can have aconsiderable impact on quality of life. They also have concernsabout body image, peer acceptance, physical capabilities interms of exercise and activity, and the physiological delay ofpuberty caused by their asthma, all of which can complicatetheir asthma treatment goals.\\nIn addition, because of a need to emphasise their own\\nidentity, they may become isolated and may experience anxietyand depression, especially if they are excluded fromparticipation in the decision making process regarding theircondition. They may also participate in risky behaviour such ascigarette smoking and non-compliance with treatment, whichmay account for their increased morbidity and mortality.\\nIn 2000, annual hospital admission rates for asthma were 48\\nper 10 000 children aged /H110215 and 16 per 10 000 children aged\\n5-14. Between 1990 and 2000, hospital admission rates haddecreased by 52% among children /H110215 and by 45% among\\nchildren aged 5-14.

Holding separate clinics for young people and\\nbeing prepared to discuss wider issues other than asthma maygo some way to improve understanding and compliance.\\nDiagnosis of asthma\\nThe diagnosis of asthma is made after taking an appropriateclinical history and examination, testing for reversibility ofbronchoconstriction and assessing a response to therapy.Demonstration of airway reversibility or a short term trial withantiasthma therapy may be useful diagnostic markers, especiallyin those children with episodic symptoms (see chapter 3 onpeak flow variation, p.9).\\nPresentation\\nIn school age children there is little difficulty in recognisingasthma, especially when one asks specifically about cough,wheeze, shortness of breath, and exercise induced symptoms.Preschool children sometimes present with cough alone. Theother characteristics that suggest asthma are episodic cough orwheeze and symptoms that are worse at night, after exercise orexposure to allergens, and with viral respiratory tract infections.Asthmatic babies sometimes have attacks of breathlessnesswithout obvious wheezing.\\nHypersecretory asthma\\nSome asthmatic children produce large amounts of bronchialsecretions. This is called hypersecretory asthma. Increasedproduction of mucus is associated with a productive cough,airway plugging, and areas of collapse on the chest radiograph.These children may be misdiagnosed as having recurrent lowerrespiratory tract infection.\\nMost wheezing in infancy is due to accumulation of\\nsecretions in the airway in response to bronchial inflammation.Certain features, however, suggest that the cough or wheezingmay be caused by factors other than asthma. These includeonset soon after birth, chronic diarrhoea or failure to thrive,recurrent infections, a persistent wet cough, stridor, choking ordifficulty with swallowing, mediastinal or focal abnormalities onthe chest radiograph, and the presence of cardiovascularabnormalities.\\nLung function and other tests\\nWhen possible the diagnosis should be confirmed by lungfunction testing. This can be done at any age, but in infantsand very young children the facilities are available only inspecialised centres. From the age of 4 some children can use apeak flow meter, and the peak flow reading can be comparedwith a range of values related to the child’s height. A normalpeak flow reading at one examination does not exclude asthmaand several recordings made at home may be more valuable. Ifthe result of spirometry is normal, then reversibility testing is oflittle use. Occasionally an exercise test or therapeutic trial isnecessary to confirm the diagnosis. Measurement of total IgEconcentration will ascertain only whether the child is atopic. Achest radiograph is more useful to look for other causes ofwheezing than to diagnose asthma.\\nLabelling\\nMaking a diagnosis of asthma carries with it a certain stigma,for no parent likes to be told their child may have a chronicillness with the possibility of recurrent exacerbations. Withappropriate explanation and reassurance, however, parentalanxiety is more likely to be reduced and compliance withtherapy increased.\\nA peak flow meter can be used by some children (over \\n4 years) to test lung function.

This is probably because the amount of drug deliveredin a suspension from a nebuliser to a freely breathing infant oryoung child is small. Over three quarters of the drug remainsin the nebuliser and fewer than 20% of the nebulised dropletscontaining the drug are /H110215 /H9262m diameter. To overcome this\\nproblem it is necessary to use large starting doses. Doses ofnebulised budesonide up to 1000 /H9262g/day have shown a\\ntherapeutic effect in infants with severe asthma.\\nAdverse effects\\nThere is a reluctance to give inhaled and oral steroids to youngchildren because of possible side effects. Local side effects suchas oral thrush and dysphonia are rare in children, probablybecause powder inhalers and spacer devices are used.\\nIt is difficult to separate the adverse effects of asthma from\\nthe adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids on children’sgrowth. Likewise, if children whose asthma is well controlled onlow dose steroids are placed on high dose steroids, growth maybe stunted, whereas children with severe asthma may notexperience any adverse effects but instead may enjoy a goodperiod of growth as a result of better control.\\nEvidence on the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on\\ngrowth shows that both beclometasone and budesonide atdoses used at step 3 or above of the BTS guidelines affectchildhood growth as assessed by knemometry (leg length belowthe knee) and conventional stadiometry. Studies have not,however, shown any adverse effect on final height.\\nThe exact mechanism of the adverse effect of inhaled\\nsteroids on growth is unknown but is believed to be the resultof decreased bone turnover rather than changes in growthhormone or IGF1 levels. The effects of inhaled corticosteroidson bone mineral density are more worrying because they arecumulative. Long term inhaled corticosteroids may be inducinga state of bone demineralisation that could lead to osteoporosisin the long term, particularly in women.\\nSome studies have identified symptomatic adrenal\\ninsufficiency in children on high dosages of inhaledcorticosteroids. A recent study by Masoli and colleaguessuggests that therapeutic gain at high doses of inhaledcorticosteroids /H11022800 /H9262g/day is likely to be small—the so called\\n“ceiling effect”—and therefore the clinician has to excludeother causes of treatment failure, such as poor adherence totreatment and alternative diagnoses, before using higher dosesof inhaled corticosteroids as recommended at step 4.\\nA few children on high doses of inhaled steroid have clinicalDrug treatment\\n57Management of mild to moderate exacerbations of asthma in children.\\nAdapted from guidelines from the British Thoracic Society and ScottishIntercollegiate Guidelines Network\\nStadiometry can be used to measure\\ngrowth in children', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/ABC of Asthma.pdf', 'page': 63}),\n"," Document(page_content='adrenal insufficiency and present with hypoglycaemic episodes,\\ncoma, or convulsions.

They are available for\\npaediatric usage at step 3 of the guidelines. In the UK,salmeterol is currently licensed for use in children from the ageof 4 and formoterol in children age /H110226. They increase airway\\ncalibre for at least 12 hours, prevent exercise-induced symptomsfor up to nine hours, and reduce the frequency of exacerbations.\\nTheir safety profile is similar to that of short acting /H9252\\n2\\nagonists. Although symptoms improve when these agents aregiven alone, their use is more appropriate in conjunction withregular anti-inflammatory therapy.\\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists\\nLeukotrienes are a recognised mediator of asthma as they causebronchoconstriction, mucous secretion, and increased vascularpermeability, promoting eosinophil migration into airwaysmucosa. Recent studies in children aged 6-14 treated withleukotriene receptor antagonists have shown an improvement inexercise induced bronchospasm and an improvement in FEV\\n1.\\nCurrently in the UK, montelukast (available in granules or as apink, chewable, cherry flavoured tablet) is licensed for childrenaged /H110222 years and zafirlukast in those aged /H1102212. These drugs\\nare currently used at step 2 (children aged /H110215) or step 3\\n(children aged 5-12) in the management of paediatric asthma.\\nSodium cromoglicate\\nSodium cromoglicate is completely safe with virtually no sideeffects, even when it is taken regularly for years. Its taste andthe requirement for it to be taken three or four times a day,however, makes non-compliance a common reason for failureof treatment. Furthermore, there is little evidence base for itsuse in the modern management of asthma.\\nTheophyllines\\nTheophylline can improve lung function and act as an effectivebronchodilator with some anti-inflammatory action. Its safetymargin is low compared with other bronchodilators and it isnecessary to monitor treatment by serum concentration. It isimportant to bear in mind that barbiturates, carbamazepine,phenytoin, and rifamicin may reduce blood concentrations ofxanthine derivatives and conversely cimetidine, erythromycin,and ciprofloxacin may increase these concentrations. Slowrelease granule preparations may suit some children.\\nOral agents\\nWhen a drug has to be taken regularly there are potentialadvantages if it can be taken by mouth and only once or twice aday. Slow release theophylline in doses titrated to give bloodconcentrations of 10-20 mg/l will control asthma in childrenwith frequent symptoms, but it is relatively ineffective inpreventing the wheezing that accompanies viral upperrespiratory tract infections.

Because of problems with giving the drugand its side effects, use has been restricted to children whoseasthma is uncontrolled despite treatment with inhaled steroidsand where there has been no response to long acting /H9252\\n2\\nagonists (step 3 add-on therapy).\\nInhaler devices\\nWhenever possible asthma treatment should be given to childrenby inhalation, and the most common reasons for failure ofinhaled treatment are inappropriate selection or incorrect use ofthe inhaler. Children become fully aware of their own breathingand recognise the difference between inspiration and expirationby about the age of 3; until then they need inhalation devicesthat require only tidal breathing. Inspiratory flow rates are slowerand the airways narrower in children, and both these factorsinfluence the dose inhaled and the site of deposition of thedrug. The choice of inhaler will depend on the child’s age andpreference for a particular device.\\nAerosols and powders\\nHydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellants are replacingchlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants in pressurised metereddose inhalers (pMDIs). Patients may notice a slight tastedifference as a result and should be warned about this.\\nMost children under the age of 10 are unable to achieve the\\ncoordination needed to use an unmodified pMDI. Less thanhalf of children obtain benefit from these devices because ofpoor inhalation technique. Breath actuated aerosol inhalers(Autohaler) are easier to use, but a child tends to close theglottis when the breath actuated valve opens and fewer childrenunder the age of 7 are able to use these inhalers.\\nThe age at which breath actuated dry powder inhalers such\\nas the Accuhaler and Turbohaler can be used depends on theoptimal inspiratory flow rate—for example, the Turbohalerneeds an inspiration of about 30 l/minute. The latter cantherefore be used in children over the age of 4-5 with propertraining. In addition, twice as much drug can be deposited inthe lungs with a Turbohaler than with the same drug given viaa pMDI (without a spacer).\\nSpacers and nebulisers\\nA spacer device reduces the velocity of the particles before theyreach the mouth and allows more of the propellant toevaporate so that the inhaled particles become smaller andpenetrate further into the lungs. Recent developments includethat of a metal spacer device, which has no electrostatic charge,no dead space, and may allow better lung deposition. Afteractivation of the drug canister, the aerosol can be inhaled bytaking a few breaths sufficient to open and close the valveattached to the mouthpiece. Children can use spacers in thisway from the age of 2. Children under 2 can be given inhalerswith a spacer and mask with the spacer held at 45 /H11034to keep the\\nvalve open. The infant can then inhale the medication duringnormal tidal respiration. During acute attacks, infants andyoung children may not tolerate a facemask, in which case onlynebulised treatment is appropriate. Some parents report thattheir children cannot tolerate a facemask at all, and so a paperdrinks carton can be used in place of a spacer.Drug treatment\\n59\\nA 6 year old girl using a breath actuated aerosol inhaler\\n(3M United Kingdom plc)Inhaler devices for children\\nAge (years)\\n1-2 3-5 /H113505\\npMDI /H11001spacer 1st choice 2nd choice —\\npMDI /H11001spacer 2nd choice 1st choice 2nd choice\\nBreath actuated Inappropriate Useful Equal 1st\\naerosol inhalers choice\\nBreath actuated Inappropriate Occasionally Equal 1st\\ndry powder inhaler useful choice\\nA 5 year old boy using a pMDI and spacer', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/ABC of Asthma.pdf', 'page': 65}),\n"," Document(page_content='The spacer should be cleaned when it becomes cloudy and\\nat least once a month.

Where possible they should bereplaced every 6 to 12 months.\\nNebulisers\\nMetered dose inhaler therapy with a spacer is at least as good asa nebuliser for treating mild and moderate exacerbations ofasthma. In wheezy infants short acting /H9252\\n2adrenergic\\nbronchodilators inhaled through a nebuliser may sometimes beassociated with worsening of intrathoracic airway function: thepoor response may be related to the small dose of drugreaching the airways. In young children the anticholinergicagent ipratropium bromide may be beneficial, given eitherthrough a nebuliser or a spacer device with a facemask.\\nNebulisers are expensive, time consuming, and\\ninconvenient. They are often used incorrectly at home. Acompressor and jet nebuliser suitable for giving asthmamedication should have a driving gas flow rate of 8-10 l/minute and a volume fill of 4 ml; this is particularlyimportant when suspensions such as inhaled steroid are given.The equivalent dose for older children is not necessarilyappropriate for a younger age group because inhalationtechnique, volume of tidal breathing, and the anatomy of theupper airway are different. Despite these reservations, however,there is an important place for the judicious use of nebulisersin the treatment of young asthmatic children at home. Adouble blind placebo controlled study of 36 children withpoorly controlled asthma, showed a significant improvement intheir asthma and reduction in intake of oral corticosteroids.\\nChoice of device\\nThe patient’s preference is of major importance in the choiceof device. Many patients are unable to use pMDIs correctly, andeven with good technique only 10-15% of the dose is deliveredto the lungs.\\nSpacer devices will reduce problems with coordination and\\nimprove lung deposition. Children on regular prophylacticinhaled steroids are advised to use a spacer at all times. Evenwhen a spacer device is used, correct positioning of the device,inhalation of the drug within 10-20 seconds, single doseactuations, and regular rinsing and drip drying of the spacerdevices are important take home instructions.\\nDry powder inhalers may also vary in their lung deposition,\\nand up to 30% of a drug may reach the lungs with a goodtechnique. The main determining factor for their use isvariations in the inspiratory flow rate.\\nThe future\\nOur understanding of the pathogenesis of childhood asthmacontinues to improve. However, we still need to identify moreprecisely those factors that can prevent the onset of disease andmodify disease progression. Genetic markers should enable usto identify those children at risk, as well as allow more specificpharmacological therapies in individual cases.\\nImmunomodulation and modification of fetal and early life\\nenvironmental factors are currently being evaluated, but in themeantime we need to improve both our and our patients’understanding of the disease, improve adherence to therapy,and continue to follow guidelines of management to minimisethe potential side effects of therapy.When to refer to a specialist\\nGUncertainty about the diagnosis\\nGPoor symptom control despite adequate therapy within\\nguidelines\\nGPatient on high dosages of inhaled steroid ( /H11022800 /H9262g/day)\\nGParental concern/request for a second opinion\\nGEvidence of side effects\\nFurther reading\\nGAgertoft L, Pedersen S.

They become dehydrated because of poorfluid intake, sweating, and, in the early stages, hyperventilation.This must be corrected, but there are potential risks ofoverhydrating children with severe asthma. Production ofantidiuretic hormone may be increased during the attack, andthe considerable negative intrathoracic pressures generated bythe respiratory efforts may predispose to pulmonary oedema.After correcting dehydration the wisest course is to give normalfluid requirements and measure the plasma and urineosmolality.Management of severe asthma in children\\nNebulised therapy being given via mouthpiece during treatment for an\\nacute episode of asthma', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/ABC of Asthma.pdf', 'page': 67}),\n"," Document(page_content='Features of life threatening asthma\\nGCyanosis, silent chest, poor respiratory effort\\nGFatigue or exhaustion\\nGAgitation or reduced level of consciousness\\nGDifficulty in speaking\\nGPeak flow rate /H1102133% best or predicted (in children aged /H110225)\\nGOxygen saturation /H1102192% in room airABC of Asthma\\n62Antibiotics\\nAs most asthma attacks in childhood are triggered by viruses\\nand discoloured sputum is often due to inflammatory cells suchas eosinophils and neutrophils, there is no role for antibioticsin the management of acute asthma.\\nStabilisation\\nChildren should not be discharged from hospital until they aretaking the treatment that will be used at home and the peakflow rate is at least 75% of expected or best known.\\nA paediatric asthma nurse should assess inhaler technique,\\ngive general advice and a written asthma action plan, andarrange appropriate follow-up.

In developed countries, severe and\\ndifficult asthma remains a stubborn problem in terms of healthcare costs,\\npressure on healthcare providers and individual quality of life. In low- and\\nmiddle-income countries, especially those adopting aspects of Western\\nlifestyles rapidly, asthma and associated allergy are increasing in\\nprevalence, while high mortality rates point to inadequate diagnosis and lack\\nof use of proven effective asthma treatments.\\nThis fully updated fourth edition of Fast Facts: Asthma incorporates several\\nnew perspectives. Effective asthma management must comprise accurate\\ndiagnosis and a careful assessment of the risks attributable to asthma.\\nHowever, given the widespread availability of effective asthma treatments,\\nthe initial focus of assessment has changed from a diagnosis of asthma\\nseverity based on symptoms and simple measures of lung function to the\\nachievement of asthma control and an appreciation of those factors that\\nincrease the risk of exacerbation. We have therefore further updated the\\nchapter on diagnosis to reflect this significant change in practice, as\\nrecommended by international management guidelines.\\nOnce asthma has been diagnosed, successful management is achieved by\\npatients reliably self-managing treatment regimens. Strategies to improve\\npatient self-management and medication use are the best way to achieve best\\noutcomes and quality of life.\\nDifficult-to-treat asthma is a particular focus of current interest, as the burden\\nof such severe asthma is responsible for the bulk of hospital expenditure in\\ndeveloped countries and considerable impairment of life oppor tunities in\\nindividuals. Recognizing the importance of this and the many different factors\\ncontributing to severe asthma, we have expanded the section on refractory\\nasthma, with particular focus on the importance of strategies that assess\\nairway inflammation as a biomarker by which to titrate asthma treatment,\\nsince inflammation-guided therapy improves outcomes.

It is\\ncharacterized by recurrent episodes of airflow limitation which, depending\\non the severity of the attack, produce symptoms such as breathlessness,\\nwheezing, chest tightness and cough. Acute exacerbations can be rapid or\\ngradual in onset, and may be severe and pot entially life-threatening.\\nAutopsy studies of patients who have died from asthma show hyperinflated\\nlungs, with both large and small airways blocked by plugs containing a\\nmixture of mucus, serum proteins, inflammatory cells and cell debris.\\nMicroscopic examination reveals extensive inflammatory infiltration of the\\nairways (Figure 1.1), with edema due to vasodilatation and blood ve ssel\\nengorgement, and epithelial disruption. Biopsy studies have shown increased\\nnumbers of leukocytes, particularly eosinophils, mast cells and T\\nlymphocytes, in the airways together with increases in the markers of\\nlymphocyte activation. Structural changes resulting from chronic\\ninflammation include bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia,\\nnew vessel formation, interstitial matrix deposition resulting in basement\\nmembrane thickening, and airway wall remodeling.\\nFigure 1.1 Pathological features associated with death from asthma. Airways are blocked by\\nplugs of mucus and inflammatory exudate. There is also vasodilatation and edema, vascular\\nremodeling, smooth muscle hypertrophy and thickening of the basement membrane.\\nDisease mechanisms', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Fast Facts of Asthma.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n"," Document(page_content='In many cases, asthma is an allergic disorder mediated in part by\\nimmunoglobulin (Ig)E-dependent mechanisms. Exposure to allergen results in\\nallergen uptake and its presentation by dendritic cells to T helper (Th)\\nlymphocytes (Figure 1.2).\\nFigure 1.2 Role of immunoglobulin E (IgE) in airway inflammation and asthma symptoms.\\nExposure to allergen leads to activation of T lymphocytes, cytokine expression (interleukins [ILs])\\nand release of IgE from B lymphocytes. IgE binds to cells involved in inflammation, which then\\nrelease inflammatory mediators.\\nTh lymphocytes are categorized according to the dom inant pattern of\\ncytokines secreted. Those secreting interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13 are\\nTh2, and stimulate the production of IgE from B lymphocytes. Conversely,\\nTh1 lymphocytes produce interferon (IFN)γ, which facilitates the secretion\\nof IgG by B lymphocytes. T lymphocytes in asthmatic epithelium\\npredominantly release a Th2 pattern of cytokines, indicating the cardinal\\nimportance of Th2 lymphocytes in driving the eosinophilic inflammation that\\nis characteristic of asthma.\\nThe IgE produced by the stimulated B lymphocytes binds to mast cells and,\\npossibly, other cells involved in inflammation (e.g. eosinophils), leading to\\nthe release of inflammatory mediators. Antigens can also provok e T-cell\\nactivation, cytokine and chemokine release, and production of inflammatory\\nmediators. A characteristic finding in asthma, reported only recently, is the\\npresence of mast cells distributed within airway smooth muscle.

Stimulation of mast cells through IgE-antigen binding or\\nother mechanism results in the release of these mediators together with\\nhistamine, and newly generated bronchoconstrictors such as prostaglandin D2\\nand cysteinyl leukotrienes LTC4 and LTD4. As asthma becomes more severe,\\nthe number of MCTC increases in the mucosa at the expense of MCT.

For these patients, an inhaled as-\\nneeded SABA may be appropriate therapy without a regular controller\\ntreatment. Such patients can still experience exacerbations and the intensity\\nof treatment for exacerbations should depend on the severity of the\\nexacerbation (see Chapter 5).\\nStep 2 is usually indicated for initial treatment in those who have moderate\\nsymptoms. It involves the regular use of a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid\\nmedication (Table 4.6) in addition to a rapidly acting β2-agonist for symptom\\nrelief as needed. The dose of inhaled corticosteroid at this level would range\\nfrom 200 t o 500 µ g daily of beclometasone or equivalent medication in\\nadults, and 100 t o 200 µ g daily in children. While the best available\\nevidence supports inhaled corticosteroids for asthma treatment at this level\\nfor prevention of exacerbations and symptom control, leukotriene modifiers\\nare an alternative at this treatment step. Leukotriene modifier medication is\\nparticularly favored in children for whom the dose of inhaled corticosteroid\\nneeds to be minimized, although existing evidence suggests that leukotriene\\nmodifier medication is less effective in preventing exacerbations than low-\\ndose inhaled corticosteroid medication.\\nTABLE 4.6 Daily doses of inhaled\\ncorticosteroids: definitions for low, medium\\nand high doses\\nDose\\nlevelBeclometa-sone-\\nHFA*Fluticasone\\npropionate*Ciclesonide†Budesonide*\\nLow 100-200 µg 100-200 µg 80-160 µg 200-400 µg\\nMedium 200-400 µg 200-400 µg 160-320 µg 400-800 µg\\nHigh > 400 µg > 400 µg > 320 µg > 800 µg\\n*ex-valve dose. †ex-acuator dose.

Patients who still have symptoms of uncontrolled asthma despite\\nusing a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid, or those with more severe\\nsymptoms without treatment, should progress to step 3. T his involves the\\naddition of a LABA to regularly administered low-dose inhaled\\ncorticosteroid therapy and as-needed short-acting reliever therapy. The\\navailable evidence suggests that use of a LABA at this level provides\\nsymptom control superior to that from increasing doses of inhaled\\ncorticosteroids.\\nAn alternative method of  delivering therapy at this or later stages of\\nmanagement is a combined inhaled corticosteroid/LABA for both preventer\\nand reliever therapy. This relies on the use of a rapid- and long-acting β2-\\nagonist (formoterol) in combination with a low-dose formulation of inhaled\\ncorticosteroid (usually budesonide, 200–400 µ g twice daily) to be used as\\nboth controller and reliever therapy. This treatment has the advantage of\\nconvenience, as well as enabling the delivery of increased dos es of inhaled\\ncorticosteroid for symptoms, thereby increasing anti-inflammatory controller\\ntreatment at the first sign of worsening symptoms. Evidence supports this\\napproach for reducing asthma exacerbations. A potential concern with this\\napproach is that patients may not take regular controller medication, and\\neducation therefore needs to emphasize the importance of using the\\nbudesonide/formoterol inhaler for both regular maintenance as well as\\nreliever treatment.\\nAt this treatment step, other options are the addition of a theophylline to low-\\ndose inhaled corticosteroid medication or the addition of a leukotriene\\nmodifier, but both these treatment strategies appear to be less effective than\\nthe combination of a LABA with low-dose inhaled corticosteroid.\\nStep 4. Patients with more severe asthma and persistent symptoms despite\\nstep 3 treatment should be treated with escalating doses of inhaled\\ncorticosteroid and LABA therapy in addition to a SABA. Moderate to high\\ndoses of inhaled corticosteroid treatment are up to 1000 µ g daily of HFA-\\nbeclometasone or equivalent in adults and up to 400 µ g in children.

In studies\\nof asthma in the community, asthma symptoms are frequently poor ly\\ncontrolled, bu t this is most usually due to lack of availability of, or failure to\\ntake, recommended asthma controller therapies. However, not all patients\\nachieve complete control of symptoms. For instance in a dose-escalation\\nstudy using fluticasone dipropionate and salmeterol, only 72%  of individuals\\nachieved complete control of symptoms with high-dose inhaled therapy,\\nalthough most of these had partially controlled asthma symptoms.\\nHowever, some individuals with asthma suffer from severe symptoms or may\\nhave progressive loss of lung function, together with frequent exacerbations\\ndespite optimal inhaled therapy. These individuals are considered to have\\nrefractory asthma.\\nCommunity studies of asthma severity suggest that approximately 5% of\\nasthma sufferers have severe asthma and continue to suffer from uncontrolled\\nasthma despite treatment.

It is\\nestimated that fewer than 50%  of individuals with an illness take medication\\nexactly as prescribed.\\nAsthma medication may be difficult to obt ain for reasons of cost or\\ninconvenience. Asthma places a considerable burden on individuals and\\nappears to be more common, and more severe, in lower income groups. The\\npersonal cost of asthma in terms of lost vocational oppor tunities, lost days at\\nwork and illness can be very significant and impair an individual’s capacity\\nto access and afford medical care. In some instances the financial burden of\\nregular medication can exceed a patient’s ability to pay for it. Patients can\\nthen decide not to take, or ‘ration’ asthma medication so that they receive\\nless than was prescribed.\\nNon-adherence to medication can therefore be intentional due to economic\\nreasons and other concerns surrounding medication use. Patients perform a\\n‘cost–benefit’ analysis as to whether to take prescribed medication, an\\nanalysis that includes their beliefs about the benefits of the treatment, its cost\\nto them and the likely outcome of their asthma, and their fears about side\\neffects (Figure 5.1). To address intentional non-adherence, the health\\nprofessional must take part in the patient’s analysis and address issues that\\narise in order to aid adherence to a medication plan. This can be an excellent\\nrole for an asthma health educator.\\nFigure 5.1 Diagram of patient’s decisions regarding adherence to medication: patients undertake a\\ncost-benefit analysis of medication use.\\nPeople with asthma may also suffer from comorbidities that render it more\\ndifficult for them to acquire and take medication.

Many people, especially the young and very old, find the\\nmanipulation of inhaled devices difficult. A major part of consultation with a\\npatient who is not successful in achieving good a sthma control should be a\\nreview of inhaler use and technique, as this can be a significant barrier to\\neffective treatment. Routinely, the substitution of a spacer device with an\\nMDI can improve medication delivery and consequently asthma control. A\\nfurther consideration is in those with low lung function and consequent poor\\ninspiratory flows who may not reach required inspiratory flow to achieve\\ndrug deposition with dry pow der devices.\\nSo the first step in uncontrolled or poor ly controlled asthma is the assessment\\nof medication use and adherence.

In children, asthma exacerbations remain\\none of the most common causes of school absence and hospital admission. In\\nadults, exacerbations are responsible for loss of work time, emergency\\nasthma attendances to primary care practitioners and hospital presentation\\nand admission. A major indicator of risk for emergency asthma attendance is\\nprevious emergency attendance, indicating that preventive strategies should\\nbe applied for such individuals to prevent future severe and even life-\\nthreatening episodes. Fear of acute severe asthma is a major burden for many\\nwho live with severe asthma, and is a further reason for taking steps to\\nprevent severe attacks.\\nPatients at risk\\nAny patient with asthma can suffer from an acute asthma episode, often\\ndescribed as an asthma attack. Viral respiratory infections are the most\\ncommon cause, accounting for at least 50%  of hospital admissions for asthma\\nin adults and ove r 80%  in children. Such infections can be responsible for a\\nrapid decline in lung function, which may not be entirely prevented by\\nregular inhaled controller (preventer) therapy.\\nOther causes of acute asthma include acute allergen exposure, when an\\nallergic person is exposed to an allergen not usually encountered in the\\nenvironment. Examples of this include ‘thunderstorm asthma’ in people who\\nusually have allergic rhinitis due to grass pollens, or individuals with allergy\\nto molds. Inhalation of small allergen particles into the lower respiratory\\ntract can cause a severe asthma episode and weather patterns can lead to\\nepidemics of asthma in such circumstances. Similarly, severe food a llergies\\n(e.g. to peanuts or shellfish) may trigger asthma. While individuals with such\\na food a llergy often present with signs of anaphylaxis, acute asthma is a\\nmajor component of a severe food r eaction for some and it requires\\nrecognition and treatment in its own right.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Fast Facts of Asthma.pdf', 'page': 87}),\n"," Document(page_content='Some medications, such as β-blockers – even in eye drops – may also be\\nresponsible for an acute exacerbation of asthma.

A fall in FEV1 of 10%  following the eucapnic voluntary\\nhyperventilation challenge has been adopted by the International Olympic\\nCommittee as the preferred criterion for confirmation of an asthma diagnosis\\nin elite athletes.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Fast Facts of Asthma.pdf', 'page': 112}),\n"," Document(page_content='Indirect airway challenges such as mannitol and hypertonic saline have been\\nshown to correlate very well with eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation\\nchallenges.

It is\\ntherefore important not to exclude exercise-induced asthma on the basis of a\\nnegative direct airway challenge test result.\\nExercise-induced asthma in athletes\\nThe high prevalence of exercise-induced asthma in elite athletes has been an\\nissue of concern. Escalating use of bronchodilator treatments by elite athletes\\nhas prompted rulings from the International Olympic Committee so that\\ndiagnosis of asthma in elite competition must be confirmed by lung function\\nabnormality or challenge testing. Some elite cold-weather athletes, such as\\ncross-country skiers, are very likely to develop exercise-induced asthma (so\\ncalled ‘skier’s asthma’). In summer athletes, a high occurrence of asthma has\\nbeen reported in elite swimmers. In both these instances, training for\\nprolonged periods at high ventilatory workloads and consequent high\\nexposure to very cold or chlorinated air, respectively, is thought to contribute\\nto an airway injury that may lead to exercise-induced asthma. The finding that\\nolder athletes and those from sports that are predominantly aerobic are more\\nlikely to have exercise-induced asthma supports this theory.\\nThe symptoms of elite athletes with asthma are thought to differ from those of\\nnon-athletes in that they may complain of poor  performance or fatigue rather\\nthan dyspnea. Investigation of symptoms of elite athletes revealed that\\ntraditional asthma symptoms have a sensitivity of only 60%  in predicting\\nexercise-induced bronchoconstriction in laboratory challenge. Thus, poor\\nperformance in an athlete ought to prompt consideration of exercise-induced\\nasthma. The diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma in elite athletes must be\\nverified by airway challenges.

It has been suggested that this\\nobserved increase may be due to the decreasing incidence of childhood\\ninfections and other environmental influences such as alteration in diet and\\nintestinal bacterial flora. Immune stimulation by infections in early life may\\nbe necessary for the differentiation of T regulatory lymphocytes which can\\nmodulate immune responses.

The\\nrole of dietary manipulation early in life to prevent allergic disease is still\\nthe subject of intense interest, with large-scale cohort studies under way.\\nStudies are also under way to attempt to manipulate the responses to\\nallergens early in life to facilitate the development of regulatory immune\\nresponses. These include trials of mycobacterial vaccines and probiotics.\\nAllergen immunotherapy is a productive area for developments in this arena.\\nSome evidence exists that allergen immunotherapy can prevent the\\ndevelopment of asthma in those with allergic rhinitis. Increasing attention is\\nbeing devoted to the development of safer forms of injected allergen\\nimmunotherapy and more convenient modes of sublingual administration of\\nallergen immunotherapy extracts.\\nIn addition, intensive research is focused on developing a safer form of\\ninhaled corticosteroid that interferes with the inflammatory pathways\\nunderpinning the pathogenesis of asthma and yet does not produce the usual\\nside effects.\\nAssessing airway inflammation', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Fast Facts of Asthma.pdf', 'page': 116}),\n"," Document(page_content='The development of methods of measuring the underlying airway\\ninflammation in asthma heralds changes in the choice of asthma treatments.\\nThe most commonly used non-invasive method of  establishing the nature of\\nairway inflammation is induced sputum analysis for cells, which is\\ncumbersome to incorporate into daily clinical practice.

After years of standard care and one size \\nfits all treatment, things have improved substan -\\ntially, and little in the medical field has changed so \\nmuch and so fast since the appearance of inhaled \\ncorticosteroids than asthma care, involving asthma \\nassessment, differentiated testing, multimodal \\ntreatment options and follow-up schedules. The \\nlatter has, during the COVID pandemic, switched \\nfrom clinic visits to web-based follow-up, requir -\\ning even more differentiated care, as objective \\nmeasurements must be taken in patients’ homes.\\nAlthough many asthma patients are easy to \\nmanage, there is a substantial group with moder -\\nate to severe asthma who are more complicated \\nand need the evaluation of endotypes, phenotypes \\nand comorbidities. Thus, since the discovery of \\ntargeted biologic drugs (i.e., monoclonal anti -\\nbodies), everything concerning the assessment of \\npatients with moderate to severe asthma, the man -\\nagement of their disease and the follow-up sched -\\nules has changed substantially. Furthermore, the \\ncomorbidities in asthma, which as part of treat -\\nable traits, that is pulmonary, extrapulmonary \\nand other risk factors, have also changed from \\nbeing simplistically assessed and managed to a \\nmore multidisciplinary approach. Importantly, \\nasthma treatment has changed from a one size fits \\nall approach to personalised medicine and care, \\nwhich has required a change from simple assess -\\nment to a systemic assessment in which the exact \\nendotype and phenotype must be clarified.\\nThe three authors are very similar in age but \\nwere educated and lived in different parts of the \\nworld. They all trained as MDs during the one \\nsize fits all era but have grown and developed \\nclinically and scientifically based on experience and research within the areas of inflammation, \\nhyperresponsiveness, disease management, data \\ncapture and pharmaceuticals, with an increas -\\ning number of studies following RCT principles. \\nAlthough there are different traditions in different \\nplaces in terms of asthma management, hospital \\nsystems and peripheral versus centralised care, we \\nhave found that the basic science has led to funda -\\nmentally similar approaches to asthma manage -\\nment and monitoring of patients with asthma. All \\npatients should be managed individually in order \\nto be managed equally, and we have discovered \\nthrough discussions that our fundamental views \\non the science have produced similar reflections \\non Type-2 and non-Type-2 inflammation, how to \\nevaluate them and the choices of treatment. This \\nprinciple of focusing on treatable traits can also \\nbe used in the management of less severe patients, \\nalthough not all management tools are needed \\nfor all severities of asthma, and decisions will be \\ninfluenced by the setting in which the patients \\nare treated and sometimes the interests of the \\nhospital.\\nMany patients are easy to manage in primary \\ncare, while the more severe segment of patients \\nwill have many different treatable traits, which \\nneed orderly assessment, and this differentiated \\napproach will be shown in the various chapters \\nin this book, which will address the needs of the \\nstudent in an internship at a specialised asthma \\nclinic, the young doctor working in an outpatient \\nservice and both new and experienced researchers \\nstepping into the area of asthma assessment for \\nthe first time. These chapters seek to describe what \\nsymptoms to enquire about, which questionnaires \\nto use and which tests to conduct in the diagnosis \\nof asthma. We have used the concept of treatable \\ntraits, split into pulmonary and extrapulmonary ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n"," Document(page_content='viii Preface\\nissues, and of selected but important risk factors \\nthat you, as a clinician and researcher, will meet \\nin practice. When evaluating patients, we suggest \\nthat you consider the same three issues mentioned \\nabove, and this approach will ensure not only that \\neverything is covered, but also that you do not \\nfocus too much on one issue. When the patient’s \\nhistory is complete and a conclusion is reached, you \\ncan then ensure that the treatment, which could be \\npharmacological or non-pharmacological, covers \\nall three issues.\\nWe hope that this book will lead clinicians to \\nuse the right tools, make the right decisions and \\ndevelop their management skills to the benefit of \\ntheir patients – using the right treatment based \\non the right inflammatory endotype and in the \\nright doses and administrative forms. We have \\nenjoyed the development of this book, and the pro -\\ncess of writing it has also made the topics clearer \\nfor us as well.

\\nPERSPECTIVE\\nAsthma has been recognised since antiquity. The \\nword comes from the Greek ασθμα, ασθματος \\nmeaning a ‘short-drawn breath, hard breathing, or \\ndeath rattle’ and was a term used to describe a \\ncomplex of symptoms rather than a specific disease \\nentity. Early pathogenic models suggested that air -\\nflow to the body was impeded by phlegm from the \\nbrain lodging in the lungs; there was also recogni -\\ntion of an association with environmental factors, \\nincluding climate and geographical areas.\\nFrancis Rackemann, a distinguished Boston \\nPhysician, carried out a detailed longitudinal clini -\\ncal study of asthma in the first half of the 20th \\ncentury and was the first to highlight heterogene -\\nity of asthma. He commented that: ‘surely it is hard \\nto believe that the wheeze that comes to the young \\nschool girl for a day or two in the ragweed season is \\nthe same disease as that which develops suddenly in \\nthe tired business man or in the harassed housewife \\nand pushes them down to the depths of depletion and \\ndespair. The problem is still wide open: the approach \\nis not at all clear’.  Rackemann described two clinical \\nasthmatic phenotypes: extrinsic asthma, thought \\nto be due to allergens from outside the body and \\nassociated with younger age of onset, environmen -\\ntal triggers, atopy and the presence of other allergic \\ndiseases; and intrinsic asthma, due to factors intrin -\\nsic to the body associated with older age at onset and \\nthe absence of atopy.\\nThe association of asthma with bronchodilator \\nresponsiveness was formally recognised soon after \\nthe FEV1/FVC ratio was described by Hutchinson \\nin the 1940s, and this test emerged as a diagnostic \\ncriterion for asthma primarily because broncho -\\ndilator treatments were found to increase FEV1 quickly and in many cases substantially. Early in \\nthe second half of the 20th century, systemic cor -\\nticosteroids were identified as a potentially useful \\ntreatment. The introduction of systemic corticoste -\\nroid treatment in the UK was not entirely straight -\\nforward as an early and influential MRC sponsored \\nclinical trial showed little useful efficacy and high -\\nlighted a high potential for systemic toxicity. Harry \\nMorrow-Brown, a young chest physician working \\nin Derby, was surprised by these negative findings \\nand went on to show that there was clear efficacy in \\npatients with asthma who had eosinophils present \\nin their sputum smear but not in those without. He \\nused a similar method of patient selection to show \\nin the early 1970s that inhaled beclomethasone was \\nan effective topical treatment when administered \\nby aerosol and that treatment reduced the adverse \\neffects of oral corticosteroids by allowing a signifi -\\ncant number of patients to withdraw this treatment \\nwithout loss of asthma control. This work was pio -\\nneering and important as it showed for the first \\ntime that asthma is associated with different pat -\\nterns of airway inflammation and demonstrated \\nthat it is clinically important to distinguish them. It \\nalso showed that airflow limitation and bronchodi -\\nlator reversibility were not a good means for iden -\\ntifying patients best suited for anti-  inflammatory \\ntreatment with corticosteroids. Both key lessons \\nwere ignored over the next 50 years.\\nOver these 50 years, it was possible to identify \\ntwo main eras of asthma management each last -\\ning about 25 years: the bronchodilator era, starting \\nwith the introduction of increasingly selective \\ninhaled β-agonists in the mid-1960s and focusing \\non airway hyperresponsiveness as the key patho -\\nphysiological abnormality; and the anti-inflam -\\nmatory era, starting in the early 1990s, where \\nmore aggressive use of inhaled corticosteroids was ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n"," Document(page_content='2 Introduction\\nemphasised and airway inflammation was seen to \\nbe of central importance. The first era was perhaps \\nthe first to offer patients with asthma a reasonable \\nquality of life and some degree of control of their \\nsymptoms but was associated with a progressive \\nincrease in hospitalisation rates with acute severe \\nasthma and an increase in mortality from asthma \\nin many countries. This increased mortality \\noccurred in spikes, compellingly linked to overuse \\nof non-selective, or high-dose selective β-agonist \\ninhalers and underuse of inhaled corticosteroids. \\nThis association, and the increasing recognition \\nthat airway inflammation was commonly seen \\neven in patients with mild asthma, fuelled the sec -\\nond era. Increased use of inhaled corticosteroids \\nproved to be a more difficult sell than the use of \\nβ-agonists, in part because treatment had a less \\nrapid and, therefore, less obvious impact on symp -\\ntoms. Guidelines were used to encourage patients \\nand prescribers to introduce inhaled corticoste -\\nroids earlier and patient education with multi -\\ndisciplinary input was employed to encourage \\ncontinued adherence to treatment once a symp -\\ntom response had occurred. This second era was \\nassociated with an impressive reduction in hospi -\\ntalisation rates and mortality from acute asthma, \\nparticularly in children. However, progress against \\nthese outcomes has stalled in the last 10 years, \\ndespite increasing investment in the treatment, \\nand the recent National Review of Asthma Deaths \\nreport shows that preventable deaths continue to \\noccur with depressing regularity. In addition, we \\nhave not had comparable progress in the develop -\\nment of new treatments as has been seen in other \\ndisease areas.\\n1.2  A NEW ERA: ASTHMA \\nPHENOTYPES, ENDOTYPES, \\nTREATABLE TRAITS AND \\nPERSONALISED MANAGEMENT\\nIn this book, we recommend a new approach \\nwhich recognises the heterogeneity of asthma and \\nthe disassociation between symptoms and risk of \\nattacks, utilises biomarkers of eosinophilic and \\nnon-eosinophilic airway inflammation and pro -\\nvides a mechanism for individualised personalised \\nmanagement based on the identification of treat -\\nable traits as well as using standardised diagnostic tools based on objective measurements and recog -\\nnised easy to use respiratory questionnaires.\\nWe define treatable traits as aspects of the dis -\\nease that can be identified and modified with resul -\\ntant benefit to the patient. Our system moves from \\napplying the label asthma and generic, one size fits \\nall management to a new system where the label is \\nthe start of the diagnostic process and the focus is \\non what asthma the patient has.\\nThe incorrect belief is that symptom control \\nand the elimination of the risk of asthma attacks \\nare synonymous. In reality, there is a clear discon -\\nnect between characteristics used to define and \\nmonitor asthma (i.e. variable airflow obstruction, \\nasthma symptom scores) and the risk of asthma \\nattacks and the likelihood that this risk can be \\nreduced by corticosteroid treatment. This is the \\ncase between but also within patients. Thus, a \\nparadigm for asthma management that is based on \\nsymptom control and maintenance of normal lung \\nfunction can never deliver optimal outcomes.

Airway mucosal inflammation can reduce airflow by causing mucosal oedema and over-production of mucus resulting in impaction of the airway lumen. This results in airflow obstruction that may vary over hours and days and responds to anti-inflammatory treatment but not bronchodila -\\ntors. The airway response to an allergen challenge is an excellent example of a challenge that results in airflow limitation as a result of multiple mecha -\\nnisms ( Figure 2.3 ).\\n2.2  WHAT CLINICAL PROBLEMS \\nDOES IT CAUSE?\\nAirflow limitation is responsible for the cardi -\\nnal symptoms of asthma: wheeze, breathlessness, cough and chest tightness. These symptoms tend to occur in patterns, related to the trigger for bron -\\nchoconstriction ( Table 2.2 ). Nocturnal asthma and early morning symptoms occur as a result of the increased parasympathetic activity in the airways in the small hours of the morning. It is typically maximum at 4 am and minimum at 4 pm; how -\\never, it depends on the period of sleep, and can be inverted in patients with night shift. Symptoms provoked by irritant stimuli such as cold air, smoke and fumes also likely involve increased parasym -\\npathetic activity provoked by activation of irritant receptors in the airway.\\nExercise-induced asthma symptoms are par -\\nticularly likely to occur after exercise in a cool dry environment. This results in cooling and drying of the airway mucosa triggering mast cell degranu -\\nlation and bronchoconstriction mediated by the mast cell products cysteinyl-leukotrienes (CT) and histamine. After inhaled allergen in a sensitised individual, early bronchoconstriction is mediated by degranulation of mast cells secondary to aller -\\ngen-induced cross-linking of IgE on mast cells. Many patients with allergic asthma develop a late \\nFigure 2.3  Mechanisms of the early and late response to allergens. The early response is driven by \\nmast cell mediator release following cross linking of IgE by allergens on the surface of mast cells. Recruitment of eosinophils in response to the cytokines and chemokines IL-5, IL-3, G-CSF and GMCSF is important in the pathogenesis of the late response.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n"," Document(page_content='10 Pulmonary – Treatable traits\\nresponse to an inhaled allergen involving an influx \\nof eosinophils and airflow limitation as a result of airway wall oedema, activation and sensitisation of airway smooth muscle and airway mucus plugging (Table 2.2 ; Figure 2.3 ).\\n2.3 HOW CAN IT BE DETECTED?\\nBy definition, airflow limitation is defined by an abnormal expiratory spirogram ( Figure 2.1 ). \\nSpirometry shows a reduction in the forced expira -\\ntory volume in one second (FEV\\n1) compared to pre -\\ndicted values and a reduced ratio of FEV1 to forced \\nvital capacity (FVC). Normal ranges of FEV, FVC and FEV\\n1/FVC are derived from population-based \\nsurveys. Spirometric values are directly related to height and are greater for a given height in males \\nvs females and Caucasians vs non-  Cau casians. \\nValues peak in males at the age of 25 and females at 18. Equations to calculate predicted spirometric values based on age, gender, height and ethnic -\\nity are available. A great advantage of using the FEV\\n1 as the primary means of identifying airflow \\nlimitation is that the measurement is simple and, to a large extent, effort independent. These fac -\\ntors mean that measurement of FEV\\n1 is repeatable \\nwithin patients. Studies have shown that the 95% range for repeat measures is around 120 mL. This value is independent of the absolute FEV\\n1.Airway responsiveness is quantified as the pro -\\nvocative concentration or dose of agonist required to cause a 20% fall in FEV\\n1 (PC20 or PD20). Patients with \\nsymptomatic asthma usually have a methacholine PC\\n20 of <8 mg/mL ( Figure 2.4 ), and there is a weak \\nnegative correlation between severity of symptoms and the methacholine PC\\n20. The peak expiratory \\nflow (PEF) can be assessed very simply using cheap meters suitable for use at home. Although PEF is not effort independent, reproducible measures can be obtained from most patients with a little coaching. Home monitoring of PEF at least twice daily can be a useful way to confirm variable airflow limitation and identify potential causes. A within-day varia -\\ntion of >60 L/min is outside the normal within vari -\\nability and is, therefore, likely to represent abnormal variable airflow obstruction ( Figure 2.5 ). PEF moni -\\ntoring has been of particular value in supporting a diagnosis of occupational asthma where typically PEF is measured as often as every 2 hours during periods at work and away from\\xa0work.\\nA fundamental issue with spirometrically \\ndefined airflow limitation as a treatable trait is that the small airways can be extensively damaged without a major impact of forced expiratory flow because the major site of airflow limitation is the larger airways. Other techniques can be used to demonstrate and quantify airflow limitations and some might allow inferences to be drawn about \\nFigure 2.4  Airway responsiveness measured as the fall in FEV1 after increasing inhaled concentrations \\nof methacholine. Severe (yellow), moderate (orange) and mild (red) airway hyperresponsivness are shown.

However, what these techniques gain \\nin sensitivity is lost in repeatability and/or ease of measurement, and there is limited evidence that any of these methods allow clinicians to make bet -\\nter treatment decisions.\\n2.4 HOW IS IT TREATED?\\nBronchodilators are the mainstay of managing short-term airflow limitation as a result of airflow limitation and AHR.\\n2.4.1  Beta2 agonists\\nThis group of drugs act via the beta2 receptor on to increase intracellular cyclic AMP in smooth mus -\\ncle cells leading to airway smooth muscle relax -\\nation, improvements in lung function and reduced airway responsiveness ( Figure 2.6 ). Beta2 receptors \\nare also present on airway mast cells and treatment with a beta agonist may reduce mast cell media -\\ntor release. There is also some evidence of reduced airway vascularity and increased mucociliary clearance following treatment. The clinical impor -\\ntance of these non-airway smooth muscle effects is unclear as they rapidly wane with regular treatment (mediated by reduced beta receptor numbers, a phenomenon known as tachyphylaxis). The pri -\\nmary role of bronchodilators is the relief (short acting) and prevention (long acting) of symptoms due to airflow limitation. Long-acting bronchodi -\\nlators may also reduce exacerbations, particularly less severe events.\\nShort-acting beta2 agonists called SABA \\n(Salbutamol, Terbutaline) are widely used as rescue symptomatic therapy. Long-acting beta2 agonists called LABA (Salmeterol, Formoterol, Vilanterol) are currently generally recommended as the first choice for patients who have symptoms that persist despite regular inhaled corticosteroids. Salmeterol is a partial agonist of the beta2 receptor whilst formoterol is a full agonist. Both appear to have similar clinical effects, but formoterol has a more rapid onset of action. Side effects of tachycardia, tremor and muscle cramps are rarely a problem unless given in high doses. Clinically important tachyphylaxis to the airway smooth muscle effects of LABA is not thought to occur.\\nBeta2 agonists have no measurable effects on \\neosinophilic airway inflammation and their use as first-line agents in patients with asthma is not rec -\\nommended.

Long-acting anti-muscarinic agents have an excellent safety pro -\\nfile and have been shown to produce benefits when given on top of inhaled corticosteroids and LABA in patients with more severe asthma.2.4.3  Leukotriene antagonists\\nThe CT are the most potent airway smooth muscle spasmogens released by mast cells and eosinophils. They exert their effects through the CT1 receptor, and montelukast and zafirlukast are both effec -\\ntive antagonists. Studies have shown inhibition of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and a reduction in the early and late response to inhaled allergen. When added to as required beta2 ago -\\nnists, clinical trials have shown improvement in lung function, reduction in the need for rescue bronchodilators and some evidence of a reduction in eosinophilic airway inflammation. There is lim -\\nited evidence of important clinical benefits when added to inhaled corticosteroids.

Gastrointestinal upset is particularly com -\\nmon but tachycardia and arrhythmia can also occur and measurements of serum concentrations are generally advised with high-dose treatment. There has been recent interest in the use of lower-dose the -\\nophylline as side effects are less of an issue, and the combination of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and theophylline has been shown to result in comparable asthma control as higher doses of inhaled corticoste -\\nroids and may provide slightly greater improvements in lung function. A meta-analysis has suggested that LABA are more effective than theophylline in patients taking low doses of inhaled corticosteroids and result in fewer side effects. Unlike LABA, the -\\nophylline may have possible anti-inflammatory activity and have a role in some patients who have corticosteroid resistant disease.\\n2.4.5  Bronchial thermoplasty\\nBronchial thermoplasty offers a non-pharmacolog -\\nical approach to asthma treatment. The technique is targeted at the airway smooth muscle which is con -\\nsidered central to airway dysfunction in asthma. Thermal energy is applied bronchoscopically to the bronchial wall using a wired basket. This leads to the disruption of smooth muscle bundles that disrupts their function. Double-blind randomised clinical trials incorporating a sham bronchoscopy arm have shown small improvements in symptoms and a reduced risk of exacerbations, offset by an increased risk of peri-procedure asthma attacks. The exact place for this treatment has not been well established and it is available in only a few special -\\nised centres.\\n2.5  WHAT IS THE RESULT \\nOF TREATMENT?\\nAirway smooth muscle relaxation induced by any of the above treatments results in an improvement in FEV\\n1 and FEV1/FVC. This is associated with a \\nreduction in symptoms ( Table 2.4 ). None of these \\ntreatments has a clinically important effect on eosin -\\nophilic airway inflammation and the risk of more severe asthma attacks.

Allergens are picked \\nup by dendritic cells which function as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for T-helper cells at the site of regional lymph nodes. These develop into Th2 cells and produce the interleukins IL-4, 5, 9 and 13.

This acute reaction of the sensi -\\ntised system is responsible for the early response to inhaled allergen ( Figure 2.3 ).\\nIL-5 is a critical cytokine leading to maturation \\nand activation of eosinophils and is the main sys -\\ntemic regulator of eosinophil dynamics in humans. Locally, it acts as a chemo-attractant and causes migration of eosinophils to sites of damage. IL-5 functions also in combination with IL-9 to recruit mast cells and eosinophils to an affected tissue site. IL-13 has various effector functions: it acts simi -\\nlarly to IL-4 in inducing IgE production by B-cells and it induces increased mucus production and goblet cell metaplasia. It has a more extensive effect on airway smooth muscle than other cytokines and increases AHR in animal models. Whether these effects are relevant to human asthma remains to be established.\\nInterestingly, around 50% of patients with severe \\nasthma and eosinophilic inflammation are not atopic and many have normal serum IgE. This counterintuitive finding implies that the pathol -\\nogy can be induced independently of exogenous allergens. This may become a dominant mecha -\\nnism in more severe asthma which typically per -\\nsists independent of allergen exposure. A newly recognised class of cells called type-2 innate lym -\\nphoid cells (ILC2) might drive persistent eosino -\\nphilic inflammation. ILC2s produce large amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 but less IL-4, making them an attractive candidate for orchestrating the immune response in patients with non-atopic eosinophilic airway inflammation. The current paradigm for the role of ILC2s is that disruption of the epithelial barrier by an external trigger, for example, a virus, causes epithelial damage and enhances production of IL-25, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoi -\\netin (TSLP) by epithelial cells ( Figure 2.7 ). These \\ncytokines cause ILC2 activation in the tissue and release of the type-2 cytokines. Production of pros -\\ntaglandin D2 and LTE4 by recruited and activated eosinophils and mast cells might then enhance responsiveness of ILC2 cells leading to a perpetu -\\nating cycle ( Figure 2.7 ).\\nThe limited number of patients studied through \\nbronchoscopy makes it difficult to investigate hetero -\\ngeneity of the lower airway inflammatory response but less-invasive assessment of airway inflamma -\\ntion using induced sputum has shown that a sig -\\nnificant proportion of patients with asthma studied when stable and during an attack have normal induced sputum eosinophil numbers. This sputum cell profile has been reported in severe asthma and in patients who are not treated with inhaled corti -\\ncosteroids, and the absence of eosinophilic airway inflammation has been confirmed by bronchoscopy studies. Thus, the presence of a distinct non-eosino -\\nphilic asthma phenotype across the range of asthma severity seems likely. Much less is known about the drivers of morbidity in patients with type-2 low asthma, but problems related to airway infection and neutrophilic airway inflammation; obesity and systemic inflammation and pure AHR driven by mast cells and airway smooth muscle indepen -\\ndent of eosinophilic airway inflammation may be important. It is clinically important to distinguish type-2 high and type-2 low asthma as the former is associated with an increased risk of asthma attacks and an increased response to corticosteroids and biologics targeting type-2 cytokines.\\n2.6.2   What clinical problems \\ndoes it cause?\\nThere is now consistent evidence that patients with type-2 high asthma have an increased risk of asthma attacks, independent of other risk factors. Asthma attacks result from non-bronchodilator responsive airflow limitation and it is likely that, in addition to airway smooth muscle contrac -\\ntion, mechanisms such as airway wall oedema and mucus plugging make an important contribution (Figure 2.2 ). Recent attention has focused on air -\\nway mucus plugging as a key mechanism. This is thought to occur as a result of the oxidant environ -\\nment in the airway produced by eosinophil peroxi -\\ndase resulting in cross-linking of sulfhydryl groups within mucins (MUC5A particularly) and the pro -\\nduction of a hard, sticky mucus plug. The plug is further stabilised by Charcot–Leyden crystals.\\nPatients with active type-2 airway inflamma -\\ntion may have a degree of airflow limitation linked to this and other mechanisms when stable and improvements in lung function and symptoms can be seen with treatments targeting type-2 immunity, particularly in patients with good evidence of acti -\\nvation of this pathway. Cough reflex hypersensi -\\ntivity may also be a problem and is the dominant abnormality in patients with eosinophilic bron -\\nchitis, a condition associated with an inhaled ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n"," Document(page_content='2.6 Type-2 airway inflammation  17\\ncorticosteroid-responsive cough and evidence of \\ntype-2 airway inflammation in a patient with nor -\\nmal spirometry and airway responsiveness.\\n2.6.3  How can it be detected?\\nDetection of type-2 airway inflammation requires direct measurement of the process with bronchos -\\ncopy or induced sputum or an indirect assessment using biomarkers ( Table 2.5 ). Symptoms, lung \\nfunction tests, diagnostic label, serum IgE and allergy tests are not reliable ways to identify type-2 airway inflammation. The blood eosinophil count and exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) are the most clini -\\ncally accessible and helpful biomarkers. Both are independently associated with the risk of asthma attacks and the likelihood of a response to corti -\\ncosteroids or biologics targeting type-2 cytokines. The prognostic and predictive value of these bio -\\nmarkers is related to the intensity and consistency of the signal and is greater if both biomarkers are raised rather than one. Assessment of type-2 airway inflammation using the blood eosinophil count and FeNO is, therefore, of fundamental importance in any patient with suspected asthma.2.6.3.1  DIRECT METHODS\\nBronchial biopsy has been considered the ‘gold standard’ for investigating airway inflammation and tissue remodelling, but it is invasive, costly, complex to perform and not readily accessible in clinics or research centres. Bronchoalveolar lavage also involves bronchoscopy, is often poorly toler -\\nated by patients with asthma and has to be con -\\nducted in a specialised hospital, preventing its widespread use in routine clinical practice. Sputum induction is less invasive and more feasible than bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage, but it is too technically complex and difficult to stan -\\ndardise for routine practice and, therefore, gener -\\nally only used in specialised centres and usually in a research setting. Induced sputum and bron -\\nchoalveolar lavage were key to the identification of distinct inflammatory phenotypes and provided proof of concept that biomarker-directed manage -\\nment resulted in better outcomes in asthma.\\n2.6.3.2   FRACTIONAL EXHALED NITRIC \\nOXIDE (F eNO)\\nThe measurement of FeNO is a relatively simple, fast, non-invasive and reproducible technique  \\nTable 2.5  Potential biomarkers of eosinophilic airway inflammation \\nBiomarkerAssociation with \\ntreatment response Invasiveness Comments\\nFeNO Corticosteroids, \\nanti-IL-13, anti-IL-4 and -13, anti-IgENon-invasive Easy, quick, not specific, cheap, generally \\navailable.

Eosinophils are important drivers of \\nsevere exacerbations in asthma, and blood eosin -\\nophil counts are useful in the early detection of \\nexacerbations and the regulation of steroid dosage. \\nMepolizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody \\nagainst IL-5, is a selective and effective inhibi -\\ntor of eosinophilic inflammation which signifi -\\ncantly decreases the frequency of asthma attacks \\nin patients with severe asthma and evidence of \\neosinophilic airway inflammation, despite treat -\\nment with high doses of corticosteroids. The ben -\\nefits of treatment are closely associated with the \\nblood eosinophil count, and the clinical response \\nis marked in patients with pre-treatment eosino -\\nphilia and absent in patients with a count <150/μL. \\nThis is also the case for other biologics that reduce \\ntype-2 airway inflammation by targeting alterna -\\ntive targets (i.e. Dupilumab and Omalizumab).\\nChanges in the activation profile of eosino -\\nphils in peripheral blood reflect their response to \\npro- and anti-inflammatory signals; for example, \\nmembrane-  bound integrins become activated when eosinophils are primed to leave the circulation and \\nenter tissue. Whether the assessment of differences \\nin the activation profile of eosinophils or the con -\\ncentration of products of activated eosinophils (i.e. \\neosinophilic cationic protein) results in clinically \\nimportant insights is unclear.\\nAlthough peripheral blood eosinophil data are \\nreadily available from a standard complete blood \\ncount, the clinical utility of the blood eosinophil \\ncount as a biomarker for type-2 airway inflamma -\\ntion may be limited in some situations because a \\nraised count can also be caused by allergies else -\\nwhere, autoimmune disease, neoplasia and para -\\nsitic infections. It is now clear that the prognostic \\nand predictive value of the blood eosinophil count \\nis greater for a given blood eosinophil count when \\nFeNO is raised. These biomarkers should, there -\\nfore, be viewed as complementary and additive \\nbecause they identify inflammation in different \\ncompartments and are mediated by different key \\ntype-2 cytokines.\\n2.6.3.4  IgE\\nSerum levels of total and allergen-specific IgE have \\nbeen considered as potential biomarkers for study \\npopulation characterisation and for the assessment \\nof effectiveness in intervention studies in asthma. \\nHowever, in clinical trials of Omalizumab, pre-\\ntreatment levels of total IgE or antigen-specific IgE \\nwere inconsistent in predicting response to treat -\\nment and neither serum IgE or allergen-specific \\nIgE have emerged as consistent prognostic or pre -\\ndictive biomarkers.\\n2.6.3.5 OTHER METHODS\\nVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be mea -\\nsured in exhaled breath and their profile patterns \\nmight potentially be used to distinguish different \\nasthma phenotypes. ‘Electronic nose’ technology \\nprovides a means of studying VOCs in individual \\npatients, by utilising an array of sensors that react \\nwith different VOCs to generate a specific ‘breath \\nprint’.

Periostin is a matricellular protein that has been identified as a component of subepithelial fibrosis in bron -\\nchial asthma. Serum periostin was subsequently shown to perform well as a predictive biomarker of the response to the anti-IL-13 monoclonal anti -\\nbody Lebrikizumab and as a prognostic and pre -\\ndictive biomarker of a response to Omalizumab in patients with allergic asthma. However, higher serum levels of periostin were not associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations in a recent cohort study and failed as a predictive bio -\\nmarker in the phase 3 studies of Lebrikizumab in moderate-severe asthma. Serum levels are higher following perturbations of bone or teeth, in chil -\\ndren and in those of Chinese descent, so there is the potential for non-type-2 airway inflammation-related factors to limit the predictive and prognos -\\ntic value of periostin.\\n2.7 HOW IS IT TREATED?\\nPotential targets for treatments directed against type-2 inflammation are shown on Figure 2.7  and \\nthe effects of treatments summarised in Table 2.4 .\\n2.7.1 Inhaled corticosteroids\\nInhaled corticosteroids are the mainstay of asthma pharmacotherapy. Examples include beclometha -\\nsone dipropionate, budesonide, fluticasone dipro -\\npionate and fluticasone furoate. They act topically in the large and medium-sized airways, binding to glucocorticoid receptors that are expressed ubiq -\\nuitously by cells. The anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids are mediated by the direct repres -\\nsion of transcription factors such as nuclear factor κB. The poor systemic bioavailability of inhaled \\ncorticosteroids minimises systemic side effects, though chronic treatment with higher doses of potent steroid may be associated with mild adre -\\nnal suppression and stunted growth in children. Corticosteroids effectively suppress type-2 airway inflammation, which is associated with a reduced frequency of asthma attacks and improvement in symptoms and lung function. The effects of treat -\\nment on symptoms and lung function may be partly mediated by treatment-associated increase in the number of beta2 receptors.\\nInhaled corticosteroids are less effective for \\nmanaging severe asthma and may not be useful to treat severe asthma exacerbations, perhaps because of the intensity and site of airway inflammation. Oral therapy is felt to be more effective in these settings.\\nPatients are often concerned about the possi -\\nbility of adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids, and in some parts of the world, notably North America, this has led to their relative underuse. At low doses, up to 800 mcg daily of beclomethasone diproprionate or budesonide or 500 mcg daily of fluticasone, side effects are not usually significant, but they do become an issue at doses beyond this (Figure 2.8 ). The dose-response curve for benefit is \\nshallow beyond the point where local and systemic side effects become common and it is becoming clear that the use of an alternative drug is a better strategy than increasing the dose of inhaled corti -\\ncosteroid in most patients.\\nDysphonia commonly occurs due to deposition \\nof inhaled corticosteroid particles locally  in the \\noropharynx, around the vocal cords, and local side effects such as oral candidiasis and hoarseness of voice may also develop. Use of a large volume spacer device and careful rinsing of the mouth after the use of inhaled corticosteroids reduces the risk of these local effects. Systemic  side effects \\ninclude bruising and atrophy of the skin, cataract formation, glaucoma and reduced bone mineral density. Suppression of the adrenocortical axis can occur with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and specific advice on use of corticosteroid replace -\\nment therapy during intercurrent illness should be considered in patients who genuinely require long-term high-dose therapy. Systemic effects occur partly due to gastrointestinal absorption of swal -\\nlowed particles and partly due to systemic absorp -\\ntion via the airways. The use of spacer devices, dry powder mechanisms and mouth rinsing after inhaler use minimise adverse effects. Another approach to minimise local side effects is to use Ciclesonide, a pro-drug which is activated by contact with the lower airway epithelium.

In these circumstances, \\ntreatment with systemic corticosteroids, usually \\nin the form of daily oral Prednisolone, may be \\nrequired to minimise symptoms and prevent severe \\nasthma exacerbations. We do not fully understand \\nwhy systemic corticosteroids are effective when \\ninhaled corticosteroids are not. Potential depletion \\nof the circulating pool of eosinophils is key as this effect is not seen to the same degree with inhaled \\ncorticosteroids. Better access to the distal lung and \\nairways obstructed by mucus plugs may also be \\nimportant.\\nWhilst courses of oral corticosteroids are \\nunquestionably a vital part of the management of \\nacute exacerbations, careful consideration should \\nbe made before they are administered on a long-\\nterm basis since there is a high risk of significant \\nadverse effects and there are now safer and more \\neffective biological agents available.

There is some evi -\\ndence that these agents have steroid-sparing effects in asthma, but each have their own safety concerns. The risk of adverse effects from the use of long-term oral corticosteroids and the lack of safe alternatives necessitates careful monitoring of the response to treatment. The use of these oral corticosteroid sparing drugs has been largely superseded by the biologic drugs targeting type-2 cytokines.\\n2.7.3  Biological agents\\nThe targets for biological agents are shown in Figure \\n2.7 and their clinical effects and effects on biomark -\\ners are summarised in Table 2.6 . Monoclonal anti-\\nbodies inhibiting the effect of IL-5 (Mepolizumab, Reslizumab and Benralizumab), IL-4 and IL-13 (Dupilumab, which inhibits both cytokines by targeting the common IL-4 receptor alpha), TSLP (Tezepelumab) and IgE (Omalizumab) are avail -\\nable for use in patients with severe asthma who continue to have asthma attacks despite optimum inhaled treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and LABA. Their effects are greater in subgroups identified using biomarkers and to a large extent, the most predictive biomarker is that most closely associated with the cytokine that is being blocked (i.e. blood eosinophils for anti-IL-5 and FeNO for anti-IL-4/13).\\nMepolizumab and Reslizumab bind to and \\ninactivate IL-5 thereby reducing the peripheral blood eosinophil count to low levels (typically <100 \\ncells/mcL). Benralizumab does this by binding to the IL-5 receptor-alpha and, as a result of aug -\\nmentation of eosinophil apoptosis via antibody-  \\ndependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, does so more completely and quickly than biological agents targeting the cytokine. Mepolizumab is adminis -\\ntered as a subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks, Benralizumab a subcutaneous injection every 8 weeks after monthly injections for 3 months and Reslizumab via a weight-based IV injection every 4 weeks.\\nThe main clinical impact of anti-IL-5 treatment \\nis to reduce the frequency of asthma exacerbations by around 50%. Treatment is also oral corticosteroid sparing and clinically important improvements in lung function, symptoms and quality of life can also occur, particularly in patients with higher blood eosinophil counts. Efficacy is apparent in patients with allergic and non-allergic asthma and is greater in patients with a high prior exacerbation frequency and an elevated blood eosinophil count. The presence, pattern and severity of symptoms or lung function abnormalities are not associated with treatment efficacy.\\nThe most clinically impactful effect of the anti-\\nIL-5 biological agents has been to reduce depen -\\ndency on regular oral corticosteroids. This has been a very significant advance as these cause serious side effects in many, including dyspeptic disorders, obe -\\nsity, psychiatric disorders, hypertension, hypercho -\\nlesterolemia, osteoporosis, type-2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and sepsis/infection. These adverse effects are dose-related across the range of doses of prednisone used in asthma (generally 10–15 mg daily) and they accumulate with time. In many patients with severe oral corticosteroid dependent asthma, they become responsible for very significant morbidity and it can be difficult to tease out asthma and treatment-related morbidity in a patient who has been on long-term treatment.\\nOmalizumab (anti-IgE) was licensed for use \\nin severe allergic asthma 15 years ago. It is now known to be particularly active in patients with type-2 airway inflammation. Proof of allergic sen -\\nsitisation to a perennial allergen is required for treatment, and serum IgE and weight are used to derive an individualised dose given subcutane -\\nously every 2–4 weeks. Treatment has been shown to reduce eosinophil counts in sputum and bron -\\nchial biopsy and reduce the frequency of asthma attacks. Published data suggest a lesser impact of Omalizumab on exacerbations and oral corticoste -\\nroid requirements than what is seen with anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-4/13 treatments. Additional limita -\\ntions include the requirement to use biomarkers that are not related to treatment efficacy to select treatment (i.e. body weight, allergic status and serum IgE) and the absence of a validated, highly responsive, predictive biomarker of treatment response.\\nDupilumab is a monoclonal antibody target -\\ning the IL-4 receptor-alpha, a common compo -\\nnent of the IL-4 and IL-13 receptors.

These outcomes are difficult to assess in clini -\\ncal trials and the clinical importance of this effect is unclear.\\n2.9  DISORDERED AIRWAY \\nMUCOSAL IMMUNITY\\nThe airway mucosa in asthma develops an abnor -\\nmal and in some cases amplified immunological response to a variety of exogenous stimuli includ -\\ning inhaled allergens, cigarette smoke, infectious agents and air pollution. Some or all of these abnormal responses may be the consequence of a failure of maturation of the immune response in early life as a result of reduced exposure to patho -\\ngens at a critical point in development.\\nThere has been particular interest in the response \\nto allergen since atopy is twice as common in patients with asthma than in controls without asthma and inhalation of allergen in a patient with atopic asthma who is sensitised to the allergen results in a marked eosinophilic airway inflammatory response developing 4–6 hours after inhalation associated with airflow obstruction (the late response) and increased airway responsiveness lasting for days and weeks ( Figure 2.3 ). Common aeroallergens in \\nmany Westernised countries include house dust mite, cat fur, grass pollen, ragweed and Aspergillus \\nfumigatus . Most patients with childhood-onset \\nasthma are sensitised to one of more of these aller -\\ngens and many have extrapulmonary manifes -\\ntations of allergy including eczema and allergic rhinitis. Opinions vary from the response to aller -\\ngen being fundamentally important in the patho -\\ngenesis of airway inflammation and dysfunction in asthma to a position where it is seen as a more peripheral mechanism. The occurrence of patho -\\nlogically similar asthma in non-atopic patients and the limited therapeutic effect of allergen avoid -\\nance and anti-IgE treatment suggest that the lat -\\nter position is correct, although there remains an uncertainty.\\nThere is little doubt that viral infections are \\nan important trigger for acute severe asthma and growing evidence of an abnormal airway response to infecting respiratory viruses result -\\ning in an amplified airway inflammatory response and worse clinical consequences.

Despite this, \\nmany patients are treated with inhalers on the assumption that they have cough variant asthma or eosinophilic bronchitis.\\nThe initial approach to an altered cough reflex \\nsensitivity would require treatment of any detect -\\nable underlying cause(s), such as airway inflam -\\nmation, airflow limitation and/or stopping of any causative agent such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. However, a significant propor -\\ntion has no obvious cause found after extensive assessment, and the best approach would then be to target the cough reflex hypersensitivity itself. Although it is possible to measure sensitivity of the cough reflex by provocation with inhaled tussive agents such as capsaicin, cough challenge tests are currently used only in animal and human research studies. Other potentially more applicable and responsive measures of cough are available includ -\\ning 24-hour cough counts and cough-specific quality of life questionnaires.\\nPurinergic signalling, a form of extracellular \\nsignalling mediated by purine nucleotides and nucleosides such as adenosine and ATP, plays a role in cough reflex hypersensitivity. Purinergic P2X \\nreceptors are a family of ligand-gated, non-  se lective \\ncation channels that open in response to extracel -\\nlular ATP and comprises seven members termed P2X\\n1–P2X7. P2X3 receptors are now recognised as \\nmajor players in mediating primary sensory effects of ATP and are found in airway nociceptive fibres. A novel P2X\\n3 receptor antagonist (Gefapixant) has \\nshown promising results in significantly reduc -\\ning cough frequency in patients with unexplained chronic cough (UCC), suggesting that this might be an important treatable trait in patients with airway disease. In addition, treatments that mod -\\nify the influence of higher centre control on the cough reflex, such as gabapentin, can also be use -\\nful. A systematic review of non-  ph armacological \\ninterventions for patients with refractory chronic cough (RCC) also suggests benefit of the use of two to four sessions of a combination of education, cough suppression techniques, breathing exercises and counselling to achieve improvements in cough reflex sensitivity and cough-related quality of life for these individuals although further research is needed to more comprehensively establish effective components, treatment duration and frequency of this package. A smaller group of patients suf -\\nfers of UCC, where no other disease exists than cough. Altered cough reflex sensitivity could also manifest as a reduced sensitivity or effectiveness of the cough reflex such as in relation to an under -\\nlying neuromuscular disease or medication. Such patients would then benefit from cough augmenta -\\ntion techniques.\\n2.11  STRUCTURAL CHANGES \\nTO THE AIRWAY\\nStructural changes in airway morphology (airway remodelling) occur probably as a result of \\nchro  nic airway inflammation and dysfunction. \\nThese changes are likely to be the basis of the asso -\\nciated with accelerated lung function decline and fixed airflow obstruction seen in some patients with asthma. Key features of airway remodelling include thickening of the sub-epithelial basement membrane caused by abnormal deposition of collagen; increased airway smooth muscle bulk; increased mucous-secreting cells and increased airway vascularity ( Figure 2.2 ). In severe asthma, \\nbronchiectasis, small airway fibrosis and emphy -\\nsema may be seen. The former abnormality is asso -\\nciated with sensitisation to aspergillus. Clinically important airway remodelling is mainly seen in adult patients with a history of severe asthma in early life and in smokers with asthma. The pres -\\nence of a significant number of patients with asthma and significant fixed airflow obstruction provides a clear potential for clinically important misclassification.\\n2.12  COMMON PATTERNS \\nOF ASTHMA\\n2.12.1   Early onset, allergic, type-2 \\nhigh asthma\\nThe commonest phenotype, early-onset allergic asthma, starts in childhood, often among boys, is associated with allergy to aero-allergens and is characterised by eosinophilic airway inflammation which can be episodic. Most patients have allergic rhinitis as concomitant disease (united airways) and suffer from mild-to-moderate asthma, although the disease can become severe in a minority of patients. The allergy to house dust mite, pollens (e.g. tree [birch] or grass) or animal dander (e.g. cat ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 41}),\n"," Document(page_content='26 Pulmonary – Treatable traits\\nor dog) can be documented by skin prick testing or \\nserum RAST, demonstrating the presence of aller -\\ngen-specific IgE. The eosinophilic airway inflam -\\nmation is evidenced by an increased percentage of eosinophils in induced sputum or airway biop -\\nsies in research settings, or by an increased blood eosinophil count and/or exhaled nitric oxide in clinical practice. Importantly, in patients with asthma who are not treated with systemic cortico -\\nsteroids, there is a significant correlation between blood eosinophilia and sputum eosinophilia.\\nThe pathogenesis of early-onset allergic eosino -\\nphilic asthma has been extensively studied. In sus -\\nceptible individuals, exposure to aero-allergens such as house dust mite leads to induction of Th2 CD4\\n+ T-lymphocytes by antigen-presenting den -\\ndritic cells ( Figure 2.7 ). These Th2 cells produce the \\ntype-2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13: IL-4 induces switching of B lymphocytes to IgE; IL-5 stimulates eosinophil development in the bone marrow and eosinophil survival in the bronchial mucosa, lead -\\ning to blood and airway eosinophilia; and IL-13 stimulates goblet cell metaplasia and bronchial hyperreactivity.\\nIt is generally accepted that upstream events in \\nthe airway epithelium involving master regulators \\nsuch as TSLP, IL -25 an d IL-33 d rive the cascade of \\ndownstream events described above ( Figure 2.7 ). \\nType-2 inflammatory responses in the airway may start in childhood when environmental stimuli (i.e. viral respiratory tract infections or exposures to cigarette smoke or other airborne pollutants) acti -\\nvate airway epithelial cells to produce these epithe -\\nlial master regulators. This initiates a pathogenic cascade, which leads to the development of asthma in children who are susceptible because they have pre-existing atopy, specific genetic risk factors in regulators of type-2 inflammation or other less well-understood vulnerabilities. The reasons why type-2 immune responses initiated during child -\\nhood become persistent are not well understood. It may be that aberrant immune programmes become established and fixed during a crucial time windows in early life when the immune system is particularly plastic. During this time, either innate or adaptive immune cells may be susceptible to epigenetic changes that lead to persistent changes in cell behaviour.\\nTh2 cells and the ensuing eosinophilic airway \\ninflammation are sensitive to therapy with inhaled corticosteroids, implicating that early-onset allergic asthma can be well controlled in the majority of patients, provided that the adherence to allergen avoidance and inhaled corticosteroid treatment is optimal and the inhalation technique is correct. However, in a subgroup of patients with early-onset allergic asthma, the disease remains uncon -\\ntrolled despite treatment with ICS and long-acting β-agonists. Additional therapy with the anti-IgE \\nmonoclonal antibody Omalizumab reduces the rate of exacerbations, including emergency visits and hospital admissions, in patients with severe allergic asthma.\\n2.12.2   Adult-onset type-2 \\nhigh asthma\\nOne phenotype of type-2 high severe asthma identified consistently by clinical and other clas -\\nsification techniques has been a highly eosino -\\nphilic, non-atopic, adult-onset form of the disease. Characteristic features include:\\n ●Onset as an adult and commonly following a viral respiratory tract infection.\\n ●Prominent upper airway symptoms with marked rhinosinusitis, often complicated by the formation of nasal polyps. These may develop before the onset of asthma.\\n ●Lower respiratory tract symptoms in the form of recurrent exacerbations which may be ini -\\ntially interpreted by the patient and healthcare advisors as chest infections.\\n ●Variable but most commonly low serum IgE and the absence of allergen-specific IgE.\\n ●Marked eosinophilic upper and lower airway inflammation despite the use of potent topical corticosteroids. This is usually associated with a peripheral blood eosinophilia.\\n ●Variable airflow obstruction and AHR are often not prominent although apparently fixed airflow obstruction can be seen.\\n ●A marked and often complete response to sys -\\ntemic treatment with corticosteroids and anti-IL-5 although the former is often required in high doses and cause significant side effects.\\n ●The common occurrence of aspirin sensitivity, where ingestion of aspirin and other inhibitors of cyclooxygenase cause acute worsening of rhinosinusitis and bronchospasm via a mecha -\\nnism involving CT.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 42}),\n"," Document(page_content='2.12 Common patterns of asthma 27\\nThe clinical course of this form of asthma is suf -\\nficiently stereotypical to suggest a common under -\\nlying cause and mechanism. There is particular \\ninterest in the possibility that eosinophilic airway \\ninflammation is mediated by type-2 cytokine \\nproduction by ILC2s. IL-4 production by ILC2s \\nis variable, so an important role for ILC2s would \\nexplain why atopy is not present and IgE levels are \\noften low. ILC2s have been identified in human \\nperipheral blood, lung, fetal gut, skin and in spu -\\ntum and are present in increased numbers in skin \\nfrom patients with allergic dermatitis.\\nSeveral lines of evidence support a role of ILC2 in \\nsevere non-atopic eosinophilic asthma. First, ILC2s \\nare present and enriched within nasal polyps and \\nsputum. Second, genome-wide association stud -\\nies of asthma have identified genes which have key \\nroles in the development and activation of ILC2s \\nincluding the gene encoding ROR- α; the genes \\nencoding IL-33 and IL-1 receptor-like 1 and the \\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism CRTH2 rs533116. \\nThird, in animal models, the development of air -\\nway eosinophilia and AHR is dependent on ILC2s. \\nFinally, ILC2s express the CRTH2 receptor and \\nemerging evidence suggests that CRTH2 antago -\\nnists reduce eosinophilic airway inflammation and \\nimprove lung function particularly in patients with \\nsevere eosinophilic asthma.\\nHigh-dose inhaled corticosteroids have poten -\\ntial local side effects (including dysphonia and \\ncandidiasis) and oral corticosteroids are associ -\\nated with systemic side effects (including cataracts, \\nosteoporosis and adrenal suppression), particu -\\nlarly when used in high doses over prolonged peri -\\nods of time.

The mechanisms of \\nasthma other than type-2 inflammation are not well understood.

In Western societ -\\nies, around 5–15% of the adult general population has asthma, 20–25% have rhinitis and 14% have or have had atopic dermatitis. In some patients, these atopic diseases may be mild, with few symp -\\ntoms or exacerbations each year, whereas other patients may experience daily symptoms and need chronic medication. The figures of severity in a population sample are somewhat uncertain due to a lack of a gold standard for epidemiological studies of asthma, rhinitis and skin lesions and a lack of objective measurements in those studies. Internationally, there is growing awareness that upper and lower respiratory tract diseases should be managed concurrently as they affect one unified airway. The entire airway tract shares basic inflam -\\nmatory mechanisms, particularly those in which you find type-2 inflammation. The prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is 2–6% in Europe and 1% in China; clinically, the disease can be divided into two different phenotypes: CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). Allergic rhinitis (AR) and CRSwNP involve type-2 inflammation, whereas CRSsNP and non-AR (also called vasomotor rhinitis) often involves non-type-2 inflammation.\\n3.1.1  A llergic rhinitis and CRS \\nmechanisms\\n3.1.1.1  A LLERGIC RHINITIS\\nAmong adult asthmatics, 65% have comorbid rhi -\\nnitis, and among adults with rhinitis, 50% also suffer from asthma, with little difference between the continents. Furthermore, 35% of adults with asthma have both rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. AR occurs more often during childhood, and it is found in 80% of children presenting with asthma and 50% of those with atopic dermatitis. AR often starts during childhood (early onset), while the first appearance of non-AR, as a rule, occurs later in life. The severity of rhinitis ranges from intermittent to persistent and from mild to severe, depending on the general symptoms, such as tiredness, fatigue and attentiveness problems, that accompany it. Seasonal AR can vary in appearance and distribu -\\ntion depending on the allergen, geographic area and level of allergens in the area. Pollen allergies vary depending on the area of the inhabitants and specific distribution of allergen (EAACI, Global Atlas 2014). Patients with a birch allergy often suf -\\nfer to varying degrees from other tree pollen as well as grass pollen allergies. Furthermore, a patient with a grass allergy in one geographic area may not have problems in other areas of the world because grass sub-families vary geographically. The fre -\\nquency of airborne allergens also varies in different areas. AR may also disappear or become less severe later in life. The course of the disease is change -\\nable, but severe disease with persistent symptoms usually predicts a long course. Thus, perennial AR related to house dust mites and domestic pets and non-AR do not have the same favourable natural course as seasonal AR since little, if any, variation occurs over the year.\\n3.1.1.2  CH RONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS)\\nPatients with asthma have a higher risk of CRS symptoms, and vice versa, regardless of atopic status. There seems to be a close association among chronic inflammatory diseases in the upper and lower airways.

Thirty to 70% of patients with CRS also \\nhave asthma; CRS is less common in patients with \\nmild asthma (in the range of 10–30%), whereas \\n70–90% of patients with severe asthma suffer from \\nCRSwNP.\\nDiseases of the upper and lower airways are \\ncommonly described as diseases of the global air -\\nways. AR, CRS and asthma affect the mucosa of \\nthe entire respiratory tract, and the immunologi -\\ncal mechanisms may be primarily dominated by \\nTh2 or non-Th2 phenotypes or a combination of \\nboth. The epithelium-derived upstream alarmines \\nTSLP and IL33 play a role in type-2-high CRS by \\nregulating dendritic and ILC2 cells. Local immu -\\nnoglobulin E (IgE) production and IgE-mediated \\nmast cell activation could play an important role \\nin type-2 CRS. One endotype found in both CRS \\nand asthma is characterised by local and sys -\\ntemic migration of eosinophils (EOS). Thus, some \\npatients with CRS are characterised by high levels \\nof local eosinophilic inflammation in the nasal tis -\\nsue (eCRS), and some have normal or low levels of \\neosinophilic inflammation (non-eCRS). The blood \\neosinophil count is an easy but only modest surro -\\ngate predictor of tissue EOS in the polyps (eCRS). \\nThus, a significantly high blood cell count (e.g. \\n>0.250 × 109/L) indicates a high likelihood of high \\ntissue eosinophil content, measured as eosinophil \\ncount per high-power field (hpf) in the nasal tis -\\nsue. However, a low blood cell count does not rule \\nout the possibility of EOS in the nasal tissue (low \\nNPV). This indicates a high specificity for blood \\neosinophil count in CRS.\\nThe underlying pathophysiological mechanism \\nthat drives CRSwNP disease is called an endotype, \\nand type-2 inflammation is the most prominent \\nof these. Type-2 inflammation is characterised by \\nthe presence of eosinophilic inflammation associ -\\nated with type-2-related cytokines (IL4, IL5 and \\nIL13) and circulating IgE. Nasal polyps are type-2 \\nactive; more Th2 cytokines are found in the nasal polyps than in mucosa biopsies of the inferior \\nturbinate and bronchial tree. Further, a high level \\nof polyp EOS in eCRS is associated with type-2 \\ninflammatory cytokines; as high levels of IL4, IL5 \\nand IL13 have been found in patients with eCRS; \\npatients with mixed CRSwNP/CRSsNP may also \\nhave positive levels of type-2 cytokines, but the \\ngroup with the highest level of these cytokines \\nalmost always includes patients with comorbid \\nCRSwNP and asthma. Other cytokines, such as \\nserum periostin, have been found in patients with \\nsevere eCRS, as well as in patients with CRSwNP \\nand EOS in the nasal tissue, but not in those with \\nmild or no eCRS. Blood eotaxin3, chemokine (C-C \\nmotif) and ligand 26 (CCL26) were significantly \\nhigher in patients suffering from eCRSwNP than \\nin those without eCRSwNP, with a positive cor -\\nrelation between a high number of mucosal EOS \\nand high levels of CCL26, but no correlation with \\nother relevant cytokines. In contrast, no relation -\\nship was found between blood EOS and CCL26.\\nPatients with CRSsNP seem to be more likely \\nto have a non-type-2 inflammatory profile, where \\nnon-TH2 disease cytokines are of significant \\nimportance. CRSsNP patients have elevated mucus \\nlevels of neutrophilic markers (MPO), IL2, IL6, \\nIL8, IL10, IL17 and IL22 compared to healthy con -\\ntrols, and in cell cultures, IL4, interferon (IFN)- γ, \\ntumour necrosis factor (TNF)- α and transforming \\ngrowth factor (TGF)- β1 levels were increased in \\npatients with CRSsNP. Similarly, non-eosinophilic \\nCRSwNP exists with a similar distribution of cyto -\\nkines as found in those with CRSsNP.\\nFinally, a classic Samter’s triad consists of non-\\nallergic asthma, polyposis/sinusitis (CRS) and intol -\\nerance to aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-  inflammatory \\ndrugs (ASA). Therefore, questions about adverse \\nreactions to ASA are obligatory for patients with \\nnasal polyps.\\n3.1.2 Clinical implications of CRS\\nRhinitis  and asthma are two diseases with many \\nsimilar features; similar inflammatory mecha -\\nnisms, epidemiological patterns and symptoms \\naffect the nose and the airways.

Patients with seasonal AR  often have asymptomatic signs \\nof airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) during the pollen season, and they may develop respiratory symptoms (asthma) during that period, especially when the pollen count is high. They may also have AHR all year round, and they have an increased risk of developing perennial asthma. In general, asthma and rhinitis are substantially undertreated and having both diseases does not change this pat -\\ntern. Patients with symptomatic rhinitis and a high nasal score measured with the Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) indicate a poor quality of life, whereas a low score indicates a relatively low burden. Contradictive, patients with symptomatic asthma with a low asthma score measured with the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) are suffering from asthma with a high disease burden and a low quality of life; patients with both asthma and rhinitis often have substantial impairment on both the RQLQ and AQLQ, with very high and very low scores, respectively.\\nPatients with CRS  live with a considerable \\nhealth burden compared with asthma and rhinitis, experiencing low quality of life, poor sleep quality, nasal congestion and secretion and decreased sense of smell. CRS is a chronic inflammatory disease of the UA that substantially diminishes health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Patients with CRSwNP often have asthma, depending on the severity of CRS and the severity of asthma. These patients are all offered local anti-inflammatory treatments, saline irrigation and, in persistent cases, a costly surgical procedure: functional endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS); however, the relapse rate after sur -\\ngery is high. New treatment will most likely change the treatment paradigm and shift from surgery to biologic drugs, not only in those with asthma, but also in those with CRSwNP only.\\n3.1.3 Recognising UA\\n3.1.3.1  RHINO-CONJUNCTIVITIS\\nThe symptoms of seasonal AR relate to the media -\\ntor release of histamine and include itching, sneez-ing and red eyes ( Table 3.1 ). In contrast, perineal rhinitis frequently involves nasal blockage, which is similar in the allergic and non-allergic types.\\n3.1.3.2   SYMPTOMS OF CRS WITH  NASAL \\nPOLYPS (CRS wNP) AND WITHOUT  \\nNASAL POLYPS (CRS sNP)\\nCRS is considered chronic  when it lasts more than \\n12 weeks without resolution despite daily treat -\\nment with nasal steroid and irrigation with saline. Adherence to treatment is important. When SNOT-22 is used to evaluate the severity of CRS, for example, patients are observed for 12 weeks, with the risk of re-call bias. In contrast to SNOT-22, the asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) asks about asthma symptoms over the last 2 weeks. This difference makes difficulties in both research and clinical evaluation of the global airways. A SNOT-22 score of 40 or above (the possible range is 0–110) supports a diagnosis of severe disease. Another score is a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10 where 0 signifies an absence of symp -\\ntoms and 10 represents the worst imaginable sever -\\nity. The total VAS score comprises the sum of nine domains: (1) global rhinosinusitis complaints, (2) rhinorrhoea, (3) sneezing, (4) nasal obstruction, (5) reduction of sense of smell, (6) headache, (7) post-nasal drip, (8) fatigue and (9) facial pain and pressure. The level of scores indicates the level of control, being controlled, partly controlled and uncontrolled disease (mean total VAS scores of 10, 23 and 45 points, respectively) ( Figure 3.1 ).

Regarding the \\nuse of oral steroids, the current documentation is \\nlimited as few studies are available; however, oral \\nsteroids seem to bring about a significant dose-\\ndependent reduction in symptoms despite the dif -\\nferences between symptoms. Furthermore, one \\nstudy has supported injection with steroids over \\noral treatment. Anyhow, the use of systemic steroids \\nis strongly discouraged due to the substantial side \\neffects. If needed, short courses are recommended \\nand only in rare cases, with large respect to side \\neffects when used for maintenance treatment.\\n3.1.4.2  NON-ALLERGIC RHINITIS\\nThe frequency of non-AR ranges from 20% to 50%. \\nThe mechanism is generally unknown; patients \\nwith this disease form a heterogenic group with \\ndifferent subgroups, and in half of the cases, no \\ncausal factors can be detected. Few suffer from \\ninflammatory problems, and steroids, including \\noral steroids, should be avoided.\\n3.1.4.3 CRS WITHOUT AND WITH POLYPS\\n3.1.4.3.1  CRSsNP\\nFor therapeutic purposes, CRS is divided into \\nCRSwNP and CRSsNP, although it remains unclear \\nwhy some patients develop polyps and others \\ndo not. Furthermore, high eosinophils in patients \\nwith CRSsNP have a higher risk of developing nasal \\npolyps. Cases without polyps are characterised by \\nthickening of the basement membrane, goblet cell \\nhyperplasia, fibrosis, oedema and, lastly, the influx \\nof inflammatory cells, most of the neutrophilic sub -\\ntype, with a cytokine pattern deviated towards the \\nTh1 subtypes. Currently available data suggests that \\ntherapy for CRSsNP should begin with daily treat -\\nment with intranasal steroids and saline irrigation. \\nThere are limited data demonstrating the efficacy of \\nsystemic steroid treatment in CRSsNP; long systemic \\nantibiotic courses are recommended, although there \\nis little documentation supporting this.\\n3.1.4.3.2  CRSwNP\\nCRS is managed with anti-inflammatory treat -\\nments with local corticosteroids, with the goal of ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 49}),\n"," Document(page_content='34 Extrapulmonary – Treatable traits\\ntotal control of the disease. nCS are often admin -\\nistered in high doses and habitually doubled up in \\ndose, at least for a period ( Table 3.2 ). Only treatable \\ntraits should be examined, and factors that exacer -\\nbate CRS should be eliminated, including smoking, allergens, occupational irritants and mucociliary clearance deficits. When treatment with nCS and saline irradiation is noneffective, short courses of oral corticosteroid are used, in similar doses to those employed in acute exacerbation of asthma (30–50 mg daily for 1–2 weeks).\\nThe use of systemic corticosteroids affects qual -\\nity of life, the general nasal symptom score and the size of the polyps. The dose can potentially be reduced from 37½ mg to 25 mg in the last week. This leads to improvement in some patients, but the effect can disappear when the dose is reduced. A meta-analysis has shown (evidence A) that the side effects of systemic corticosteroids outweigh their therapeutic advantages in the long term, except in patients with extremely severe symp -\\ntoms. One should be aware of the chronic side effects of systemic steroid. Thus, long-term treat -\\nment with systemic steroids is not recommended, but short-term courses might be needed in severe cases. Studies have shown that both short-time and long-time courses of systemic steroid have persis -\\ntent and serious adverse effect and should be lim -\\nited to as little as possible.\\nA separate indication is the use of systemic \\nsteroids pre-operatively in patients with CRSwNP. This should reduce the risk of perioperative bleed -\\ning and improve surgical outcomes of ESS. Sinus surgery is an option in case of treatment failure. Unstable patients with eosinophilic CRSwNP should be evaluated as possible candidates for biological treatment. Indications for biological treatment are a high burden of uncontrolled dis -\\nease, recurrence of nasal polyps, relapse after sur -\\ngery and side effects of steroid treatment, including the need for several acute courses of oral steroids.\\nModerate to severe CRS cases are offered ESS \\nindependent of type-2 or non-type-2 disease. In ESS, polyps and mucosa are removed endoscopi -\\ncally, and a fenestra is opened between the nasal cavity and sinuses. All patients with CRS suffer from uncontrolled disease before surgery; 3 to 4\\xa0years after primary ESS, 24%, 35% and 40% have controlled, partly controlled and uncontrolled dis -\\nease, respectively. Relapse occurs in 50% of cases, and the levels of control after the second ESS are 10%, 40% and 50%, respectively.\\nThe biological drugs recommended for patients \\nwith severe type-2 CRS are those also used to treat asthma. The first proof-of-concept studies included anti-IL4/IL13, anti-IgE and anti-IL5, as well as others like anti-TSLP. The implementation of bio -\\nlogical treatment in daily clinical practice requires multi-disciplinary teams (MDTs) that include pulmonologists, rhinologist and ENT nurses, all of whom should have an interest in immunology. Currently, there is no indication for biological treatment of CRSsNP, which is mainly driven by Th1. Furthermore, there is no indication for bio -\\nlogical treatment of cystic fibrosis, unilateral nasal polyps, mucoceles, immunodeficiencies or patient-related non-adherence to therapy.\\n3.1.5 What happens to the patients?\\nPatients with both asthma and AR develop more uncontrolled disease, and both issues should be treated in accordance with established guidelines. The more severe the disease, the higher the risk of chronic illness. Immunotherapy should be included when possible, and systemic steroids should never be used to treat these patients. Patients with non-AR have daily symptoms with -\\nout seasonal variation; treatment of this group is difficult as they have a low degree of inflammation, so steroids have little effect. Many patients tend to use regular Xylometazone, but if used frequently, it leads to increased swelling of the mucosa.\\nPatients with CRS suffer a large disease burden \\nwith many generalised symptoms such as nasal obstruction, sleep problems, loss of smell and head -\\naches.

In a study of young adults, \\nthe incidence of EILO was reported to be as high \\nas 7.5%, but this may have been slightly skewed \\ntowards higher participation by individuals with \\nsymptoms. Thus, the frequency of UA closure is \\ndifficult to estimate precisely, as more advanced \\nequipment is needed to document the closure of \\nthe laryngeal area. Laryngeal closure can be either \\nsupraglottic or glottic, which involves closure of \\nthe vocal cords. The prevalence of the disorder in \\nthe general adult or paediatric population has not \\nbeen adequately estimated, but several studies sug -\\ngest that the frequency of closure is comparable to \\nthat of asthma.\\nGlottic closure, also called VCD, is defined as \\nthe involuntary adduction of vocal cords during \\ninspiration; it can happen both at rest and during \\nexercise. VCD may be precipitated by emotional \\nstress, exercise or extrinsic or intrinsic irritants, such as chemicals or gastro-oesophageal reflux. All \\nthe above may also precipitate an asthma attack; \\ndifferential diagnosis of VCD from asthma based \\non precipitant type is not possible.\\nSupraglottic closure often occurs during exer -\\ncise and is normally defined as EILO. The supra-\\nglottic part of larynx consists of the aryepiglottic \\nfold, the cuneiform tubercles and the epiglottis; \\nall of these are supported by muscles, ligaments \\nand membranes. During exercise, the larynx nor -\\nmally opens fully, decreasing airflow resistance to \\nallow increased airflow. Supraglottic closure dur -\\ning exercise may be explained by poor support \\nfrom muscles, ligaments or laryngeal cartilages; \\nthis may reduce the size of the laryngeal aperture, \\nnegatively affecting the aerodynamic inspiratory \\nlaminar flow. However, the causal mechanism is \\nstill unknown and not fully understood.\\nThe distribution between glottic and supraglot -\\ntic closure has been reported as 1:10, but among \\nelite athletes, this distribution is slightly different. \\nOne study found that 10% of athletes had glottic \\nobstruction, 19% had a combination of glottic and \\nsupraglottic obstruction and the remaining 71% \\nhad obstruction only at the supraglottic level.\\n3.2.1  Clinical implications \\nof UA closure\\nThe predominant symptom of UA closure is dys -\\npnoea (73%), followed by wheezing (36%), stridor \\n(28%) and cough (25%). Silent auscultation of the \\nlungs during an attack of UA closure with laryn -\\ngeal wheezing or stridor is indicative of UA closure.\\nMost cases of VCD (two-thirds) occur during \\nexercise; the remaining occur at rest. Psychogenic \\nrespiratory distress produced by VCD can be eas -\\nily misdiagnosed as severe or refractory asthma or \\nother pulmonary disease; it may also be misdiag -\\nnosed as uncontrolled asthma in cases of comor -\\nbidity. Recognition of VCD is important to avoid \\nunnecessary medications and invasive treatments. \\nPsychotherapy and speech therapy effectively treat \\nmost cases of VCD.\\nIn EILO, symptoms arise during high-intensity \\nexercise when hyperventilating resolve quickly \\nat rest and reappear with the same severity when \\ntraining is resumed. This differs from EIA, which \\narises during high-intensity training or directly \\nafter exercise involving submaximal effort; it then \\nresolves slowly over a period of 30 min.

EILO is often mis -\\ndiagnosed as EIA, as both conditions can present \\nwith dyspnoea, chest tightness and cough during \\nexercise.\\nIn some patients suffering from exercise-induced \\nrespiratory symptoms with shortness of breath, \\nboth EIA and EILO may occur in parallel; in such \\ncases, both diagnoses need to be established, and \\nboth diseases need treatment. Double disease has \\nbeen found in 19% of elite athletes examined for \\nsuspicion of asthma.\\n3.2.2 Recognising UA closure\\nUA symptoms are frequently found in paediat -\\nric patients and young adults, most frequently in \\nfemale patients. They may occur at rest, or, more \\ncommonly, during exercise, especially in patients \\nwith airway closure alone.\\nThe phase of respiration (inspiration rather \\nthan expiration), location of the wheezing origin \\n(auscultation over the larynx), stridor sound, rapid \\nresolution of symptoms and timing of the symp -\\ntoms in relation to exercise may suggest exercise-\\ninduced UA closure. Stridor is the most common \\ncomplaint among these patients; many also com -\\nplain of anxiety and high stress.\\nWhen UA closure is considered, attention \\nshould also be given to the inspiratory flow-\\nvolume curve, as EILO and VCD represent UA \\nobstruction and reduced inspiratory flow. This \\nis true independent of whether symptoms occur \\nduring exercise, at rest or due to extrinsic factors \\nsuch as perfume. The typical pattern is variable \\nextrathoracic airflow obstruction. Recognition \\nof this patient profile should improve timely \\naccess to appropriate diagnostic assessments \\nand avoid unnecessary medical treatment for \\nasthma.\\n3.2.2.1  CONTINUOUS LARYNGOSCOPY \\nDURING EXERCISE TESTING\\nThe recommended procedure for a definite diag -\\nnosis of UA closure is continuous fibreoptic laryn -\\ngoscopy, which should ideally be performed under \\ncircumstances that elicit the symptoms. In cases of \\nexercise-induced symptoms, visualisation of laryn -\\ngeal structures during exercise is the gold standard \\nfor identifying not only of VCD but also supraglottic laryngeal obstruction. However, as VCD is an inter -\\nmittent phenomenon, the procedure should be \\nperformed while the patient is symptomatic. For \\nthis reason, challenges that induce VCD symptoms \\nshould be performed, such as fragrance provoca -\\ntion or exercise tests. Recently, the Continuous \\nLaryngoscopy during Exercise (CLE) test was devel -\\noped by Heimdal et al. to evaluate patients with \\nEILO; this test uses a treadmill, bicycle ergometer \\nor swimming pool. The high prevalence of misdiag -\\nnosis is largely due to a lack of universal consensus \\nregarding the key clinical features that distinguish \\nEILO or episodic laryngeal breathing disorders \\nfrom other pathologies. The choice of test depends \\non the patient’s history, and different types of chal -\\nlenges have been used, including exercise testing, \\nmethacholine challenges and irritant challenges. To \\nevaluate laryngoscopic findings during CLE, two \\napproaches have been proposed: (1) a visual grade \\nscoring system introduced and validated by Maat \\net al.; it uses an ordinal scale from 0–3 or (2) other \\ndiagnostic software-based measuring tools. In con -\\nclusion, laryngoscopy is vital to the diagnosis of UA \\nclosure, and apart from establishing the diagnosis, \\nit may also reveal other coexisting laryngeal func -\\ntional or anatomic abnormalities.\\n3.2.2.2  LUNG FUNCTION MEASURED \\nDURING AN ATTACK OF LARYNGEAL \\nOBSTRUCTION\\nWhen doing lung function testing during a CLE \\ntest, a flattened inspiratory limb and flattened or \\ntruncated inspiratory loop is considered reliable \\nfor measuring central and extra-thoracic airway \\nobstruction, provided that the plateau on inspi -\\nration is repeatable in at least three flow–volume \\ncurves after maximal inspiratory and expiratory \\nefforts by the subject. A ratio of mid-forced expi -\\nratory/inspiratory flow (FEF50/FIF50) >1 is also \\nsuggestive of variable extra-thoracic obstruction, \\nsuch as VCD. None of these parameters is a sensi -\\ntive indicator of UA obstruction during exercise, \\nparticularly in the absence of acute symptoms. \\nA recent study comparing CLE findings and spi -\\nrometry data collected pre- and post-exercise with \\nflow–volume loops found lung function measure -\\nments to be unreliable for verifying or excluding \\nEILO diagnosis; furthermore, lung function was \\nunreliable for evaluating obstruction at the glottic \\nand/or supraglottic level.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 52}),\n"," Document(page_content='3.3 Upper airway mechanisms in obstructive sleep apnoea  37\\n3.2.2.3  AHR\\nTwo-thirds of patients with UA closure also have \\nAHR; a positive methacholine challenge test indi -\\ncates that UA closure and reactive airway disease \\ncoexist. This is in line with the clinical observa -\\ntion that UA closure may mimic or coexist with \\nasthma. However, in other studies of UA closure \\nand AHR, the decline of FIF50 after a methacho -\\nline or mannitol challenge test did not correlate \\nwith the degree of EILO defined by the CLE test. \\nFurthermore, a positive challenge test in patients \\nwith suspected UA closure should be interpreted \\ncautiously, since a decline in FEV1 may be associ -\\nated with decreased inspiratory volume, which can \\nlead to a parallel drop of both FEV1 and forced vital \\ncapacity (FVC).\\n3.2.3  Treating UA closure\\nFew randomised treatment studies have been per -\\nformed due to several complicating factors.

It is unknown whether those \\naffected with EILO tend to grow out of it or whether \\nit is resolved if patients stop engaging in strenuous \\nexercise; that is, whether symptoms might disap -\\npear due to a lack of provocation.\\n3.3  UPPER AIRWAY MECHANISMS \\nIN OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP \\nAPNOEA\\nObstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is the most com -\\nmon sleep-related breathing disorder. OSA with \\nexcessive daytime sleepiness occurs in 3–18% of \\nmen and 1–17% of women. OSA is characterised by \\nrecurrent collapses of the UA during sleep, leading \\nto a remarkable reduction in or complete cessation \\nof airflow despite ongoing breathing efforts.\\nMechanical mechanism:  Asthmatics with noctur -\\nnal asthma symptoms have increased func -\\ntional residual capacity (FRC). The normal \\ndecrease in FRC during sleep is even greater \\nduring rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. \\nThis results in increased airway resistance, as \\nlow lung volume inversely increases airway \\nresistance. Moreover, probably due to some \\nneural mechanisms, airway resistance is fur -\\nther increased at night, independent of lung \\nvolume. Airway resistance can attenuate the \\nnormal tracheal tug, inducing UA collapse.3.2.2.4  F ORCED OSCILLATION TECHNIQUE\\nThere is limited data on the potential contribution \\nof Forced Oscillation Technique  (FOT) measure -\\nment to the detection of UA closure. Patients with \\nconfirmed VCD have higher amplitude spikes dur -\\ning inspiratory efforts than healthy controls or \\nasthmatic patients. The graph on inspiration is also \\ndifferent from that of healthy controls performing \\nvoluntary glottic closure. Thus, knowledge on this \\ndisease is limited, and larger studies are needed to \\nestablish the contribution of impulse oscillometry \\nto the diagnosis of VCD.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n"," Document(page_content='38 Extrapulmonary – Treatable traits\\nInflammatory mechanism:  Inflammatory infil -\\ntration of the UA due to asthma, increased \\nfat deposition in the pharyngeal walls due to \\nsteroids use or the presence of comorbidities \\nsuch as truncal obesity diminish the cross-\\nsectional diameter of the UA.\\nThe key factor seems to be the inflammation \\nthat OSA induces in the airway and systemically. \\nOSA is primarily driven by inflammation related \\nto Th1 cells. The episodes of hypoxia induced \\nby repeated collapse of the UA lead to increased \\noxidative stress, releasing a cascade to systemic \\ninflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), \\ninterleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF- α. On the other \\nhand, Th2 inflammation with eosinophilic inflam -\\nmation and Th2 cytokines such as IL4, IL5 and \\nIL13 increase the probability of asthma attacks. In \\npatients with both diseases (asthma and COPD), \\nhowever, an examination of sputum has shown \\na higher percentage of neutrophils than in those \\nwith asthma alone (where eosinophils were found). \\nIn summary, patients with both asthma and OSA \\nwould benefit from careful phenotyping as OSA \\ncan contribute to neutrophilic asthma.\\n3.3.1   Clinical implications of \\ncomorbidity of OSA \\nand asthma\\nOSA is common in adults, particularly slightly \\nobese patients; this is also true of late-onset asthma. \\nLate onset is particularly common in females with \\nlate-onset non-type-2 asthma, which is frequently \\nfound in women who are also overweight. More \\nthan two-thirds of asthma patients with night-time \\nawakening seems to have signs of OSA, especially \\nif they are overweight and have a large neck cir -\\ncumference. Furthermore, there is strong clinical \\nevidence that OSA leads to more negative asthma \\noutcomes. Patients with OSA and asthma have poor-\\nquality sleep and may have increased morbidity and \\nmortality. When they coexist, these conditions may \\naffect each other bidirectionally. The coexistence \\nof OSA in patients with asthma causes an increase \\nin persistent nocturnal asthmatic symptoms com -\\npared to those without OSA. Studies using ACT and \\nACQ questionnaires have also found that asthma is \\nless controlled in asthmatics with OSA, although \\nthis finding was not statistically significant in all \\nstudies. Similarly, other studies have found that patients with dysfunctional breathing may have \\nhigher ACQ but similar levels of AHR, indicating \\npseudo-uncontrolled asthma due to an overlap of \\nsymptoms. Yet another study found that, of 13 clini -\\ncal and environmental factors affecting recurrent \\nexacerbation of difficult-to-treat asthma, OSA is the \\nfifth independent risk factor (adjusted OR 3.4). The \\nfirst four are psychological dysfunction, recurrent \\nDuring sleep, recurrent airway obstruction \\nleads to hypoxia, desaturation and awakening \\nfrom sleep. This then leads to fragmented sleep, \\nwhich is associated with hypertension, cardiovas -\\ncular disease, diabetes and stroke. Patients with \\nasthma and OSA have both upper and lower air -\\nway obstruction during sleep. The two diseases \\nalso share several comorbidities, including obesity, \\nAR and GERD.\\n3.3.2   R ecognising obstructive \\nsleep apnoea\\nThe gold standard diagnostic test in sleep evalua -\\ntion is the overnight attended polysomnography \\n(PSG), which is rather expensive and time consum -\\ning. The severity of OSA is determined using the \\napnoea hypopnea index (AHI), which is defined as \\nthe number of apnoeas and hypopnoeas per hour of \\ntotal sleep time. With a PSG, mild sleep disturbance \\nis defined as an AHI score of ≥5 events/hour, moder -\\nate sleep disturbance as an AHI score of ≥15 events/\\nhour and severe OSA as an AHI score of ≥30 events/  \\nhour. However, since a PSG is not always avail -\\nable, many respiratory outpatient clinics and larger \\ncohort studies use validated sleep questionnaires \\n(Table 3.3 ), such as the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ), \\nthe STOP-BANG Questionnaire (SBQ), the STOP \\nQuestionnaire (STOP) or the Epworth Sleepiness \\nScale (ESS). The BQ covers three categories and con -\\ntains ten questions in each category; two or more \\npositive answers support a diagnosis of OSA. The \\nSTOP-BANG consists of four dichotomous items \\n(yes/no) and four clinical questions. A BMI over 35, \\nage over 50, neck size over 40 cm and male gender, \\nalong with a score of three or higher, are factors that \\ncan support a diagnosis of moderate to severe OSA. \\nThe STOP Sleepiness Questionnaire consists of \\nfour items that address snoring, daytime tiredness, \\nobserved apnoea and high blood pressure (STOP). \\nThe STOP is a novel self-reported questionnaire; it is respiratory infections, gastro-oesophageal  reflux \\ndisease (GERD) and severe CRS.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 54}),\n"," Document(page_content='3.3 Upper airway mechanisms in obstructive sleep apnoea  39\\neasy to use and is based on the BQ. A positive answer \\nto two or more items indicates a high risk of OSA. \\nLastly, the ESS is a self-  ad ministered questionnaire \\nwith eight questions, each rated from 0 to 3, and a total maximum score of 24. The ESS questionnaire only takes 3 minutes to answer, and it is available in many languages. A score of 0–5 indicates normal daytime sleepiness, 6–10 indicates above average daytime sleepiness, 11–12 indicates mildly exces -\\nsive daytime sleepiness, 13–15 indicates moderately excessive daytime sleepiness and 16–24 indicates severely excessive daytime sleepiness.\\nAccording to a literature search of asthma \\nresearch and sleep evaluation in PubMed, in the last 10 years, the SBQ has been used 9 times, the BQ 19 times and the ESS 37 times. It was not possible to evaluate the use of STOP Sleep Questionnaire as it was included in the search for STOP-BANG, but manual counting seems to indicate it has been used fewer than three times. Indicating that the ESS is used more than the other questionnaires to evaluate asthma patients for sleepiness.\\nAs shown in Table 3.3 , the SBQ is more sensitive \\noverall and has a better odds ratio than the other three questionnaires, although its specificity is lower than that of the ESS. The SBQ is also more accurate than the other questionnaires listed here for detect -\\ning mild, moderate and severe OSA. Sleep specialists should use the SBQ to conduct patient interviews for early diagnosis of OSA in clinical settings. However, for research with patients with asthma, the ESS might be preferable due to its specificity.\\n3.3.3  Treating OSA and asthma\\nUnrecognised OSA in patients with asthma may lead to poor asthma control and a higher asthma score (ACQ, lower ACT) despite optimal therapy. Night-time awakenings, a common symp -\\ntom of OSA, might lead to partly controlled or uncontrolled asthma. Increased anti-asthma ther -\\napy might not control asthma in patients suffering from comorbidity with OSA. However, treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) clearly improves the ESS scale and the AHI score of patients with asthma and OSA, indicating that \\nCPAP improves OSA in patients with co  mo rbidity. \\nFurthermore, CPAP improves asthmatics’ quality of life and general health (SF-36) on vital measures, but some studies have found that CPAP did not improve asthma control, whereas other studies have found that asthma control improved due to CPAP. Asthma might be out of control due to OSA, and inflamma -\\ntion due to OSA can push asthma from one inflam -\\nmatory background, e.g. Th2 to another such as Th1, which is reducing the effectiveness of ICS.\\n3.3.4   Patients with asthma \\nand OSA\\nThe effect of CPAP on patients with asthma and OSA seems to depend on the severity of the dis -\\nease. Only patients with moderate to severe asthma and severe OSA who used a CPAP for more than 4 hour/day developed better asthma control due to the combination of anti-asthma therapy and CPAP. CPAP may lead to a significant decrease in reflux, the number of exacerbations and type-2 inflam -\\nmation (measured with a FeNO test). However, it had no effect on body weight, the level of anti-asthma therapy used or other comorbidities such as GERD. Patients with severe asthma despite high doses of anti-asthma therapy (GINA step 5) and recurrent exacerbation might be admitted for treatment with add-on biological drugs, and, Table 3.3  OSA and diagnostic values of four different questionnaires\\nQuestionnaireSensitivity\\nMild-moderate-\\nsevereSpecificity\\nMild-moderate-\\nsevereOdds ratio\\nMild-moderate-\\nsevere\\nBerlin Questionnaire (BQ) 76%-77%-84% 59%-44%-38% 4.30-2.68-3.10\\nSTOP-BANG Questionnaire (SBQ) 88%-90%-93% 42%-36%-35% 5.13-5.05-6.51\\nSTOP Questionnaire (SQ) 87%-89%-90% 42%-32%-28% 4.85-3.71-3.37\\nEpworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) 54%-47%-58% 65%-61%-60% 2.18-1.45-2.10\\nSource:  Chiu, H.-Y .  et al.

It \\nmay present with or without respiratory symptoms, \\nand the underlying cause is likely attributable to \\nenvironmental stressors to the airway encountered \\nduring exercise. According to the osmotic theory, \\nEIB occurs due to hyperventilation, which dries the \\nsurface of the airway. This is followed by increased \\nosmolarity, which provokes water movement from \\nthe inflammatory cells to restore normal osmolar -\\nity. This transport of fluid from the subepithelial \\ncells leads to release of inflammatory mediators \\nand the development of bronchoconstriction. This \\ntheory is called the osmotic mechanism . Another \\ntheory is the thermal mechanism,  which attributes \\nEIB to the airway cooling which occurs during \\nhyperventilation. This cooling leads to vasocon -\\nstriction of the airway circulation, vascular leakage, \\noedema and constriction. When breathing cold air, \\nthe mechanism behind bronchoconstriction is trig -\\ngered by both thermal and osmotic stress.\\n3.4.1 Exercise and deconditioning\\nPatients with lung disease often report shortness \\nof breath, especially in connection with physical \\nactivity. Exercise testing with a measurement of gas \\nexchange can be used to evaluate patients with exer -\\ncise-induced shortness of breath and to distinguish \\ncardiovascular and respiratory causes of dyspnoea. \\nWorking capacity and maximum oxygen uptake \\n(VO2max) in healthy controls have a high associa -\\ntion, as do shortness of breath, quality of life and \\nmortality among patients suffering from respiratory \\ndiseases. In an exercise test where tidal ventilation \\nis collected continuously, irregularities in ventila -\\ntion patterns can be assessed, including mismatches \\nbetween respiration rate, tidal volume and CO2 \\nexcretion. A substantial selection of other tests can \\ndocument limited physical activity, but no other test \\ncan show the gas exchange in healthy deconditioned \\nparticipants or in patients with asthma, COPD or \\nother respiratory diseases like bronchitis.The lungs rarely limit working capacity (VO2max) \\nin individuals with good pulmonary health. The fit -\\nness score depends on age and gender (30–40 years; \\nmale average: 40–47 mL/kg/min, min <34, max \\n>52; female average: 34–41 mL/kg/min, min <27, \\nmax >48), but maximal alveolar ventilation and \\nalveolo-capillary diffusion may be limiting factors \\nfor patients with respiratory illness, especially in \\npatients with COPD and emphysema or in patients \\nwith pulmonary oedema. In addition, patients \\nwith COPD and probably also those with severe \\nasthma have increased airway resistance and \\nincreased end-expiratory volume during exercise. \\nThis increases the mechanical work for the respi -\\nratory muscles and the neural drive beyond that \\nrequired in people with healthy lungs. However, \\neven in patients with mild COPD, an increased \\nventilation – CO2 emission ratio can be observed, \\nindicating decreased respiratory efficiency. This \\nratio has been found to be almost independent of \\nFEV1 level. Patients with asthma, even those with \\nEIB during exercise, experience major changes in \\nventilatory regulation during work much less than \\nhealthy individuals.\\n3.4.2  Clinical implications of \\ndeconditioning and asthma\\nThe subjective perception of exertion in patients \\nwith asthma is often assessed using the Borg scale, \\nwhich ranges from 6 (very easy) to 20 (maximal \\nstress). Originally, Borg chose this range of values \\nto reflect the heart rate of healthy individuals doing \\nphysical work: the Borg score can be multiplied by \\nten to compare the subjective perception of exer -\\ntion to heart rate during the work in question.\\nHowever, caution should be taken if a patient \\ntakes beta-blockers, as this could artificially alter \\nthe heart rate.\\nOf patients with asthma who engage in regular \\nphysical activity, 80% experience exercise-induced \\nreduction in lung function. Even patients who do \\nnot train daily or weekly do run for the bus or to \\ncatch up with their children or grandchildren; \\nthey climb stairs, perform intercourse, or engage \\nin other daily activities. These patients often claim \\nto be deconditioned when visiting an asthma \\nspecialist or GP, but they could also have severe \\nrespiratory illness with frequent EIB and not only \\ndeconditioning. This can be tested with a bronchial \\nchallenge test and a 6MWT or a modified shuttle ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 56}),\n"," Document(page_content='3.4 Exercise and asthma  41\\ntest (MST) ( Figure 3.2 ), which is easy to perform in \\na hallway; this combination of tests can document \\nasthma control and level of conditioning. However, 6MWT might be somewhat reduced in decondi -\\ntioned patients with asthma. In such cases, VO\\n2max \\nwill show a low fitness score (low mL kg−1 min−1) \\nas a measure of conditioning (fitness) but a normal one as a measure of asthma severity.\\nWith severe asthma, functional limitations \\noccur 70–100% of the time, hindering the ability of nearly all patients to complete daily activities. This is also true for patients with severe asthma who engage in little moderate or vigorous activity and only walk half of the daily recommended number of steps. Although advancements in anti-asthma medications for patients with severe asthma show promise and may eventually allow patients with asthma to exercise, these treatments are expen -\\nsive, and suboptimal adherence will increase exer -\\ncise limitations still further. Testing patients with asthma should be routine at outpatient clinics, and medically prescribed training seems to offer a non-pharmacologic alternative and can also induce life -\\nstyle changes that will last through the entire life.\\nExercise-induced shortness of breath is a spe -\\ncific problem in elite athletes, who have high fit -\\nness scores in general (males: 60–70 mL/kg/min, min <60, max 90; females: 50–58 mL/kg/min, min \\n<50, max 72). Athletes with asthma almost always \\nhave EIA rather than asthma at rest. Elite athletes with asthma usually have non-type-2 asthma with low levels of FeNO and no blood eosinophils. The cells in the bronchial mucosa are predominantly macrophages. Examinations of exercise limita -\\ntions should rarely or never be performed on a treadmill, as the speed needed to reach maximal oxygen uptake is remarkably high for athletes. Field-specific exercise testing might be relevant, as swimmers, for example, might be less efficient when using their legs.\\n3.4.3  Recognising low fitness levels\\n3.4.3.1  S YMPTOMS\\nSymptoms of exertion include shortness of breath, dyspnoea, chest tightness and dry or wet cough. These symptoms are common in patients with asthma, particularly coughing during or after exercise. When performing maximal exertion, low or high, the hyperpnoea developed during exer -\\ncise might cause a wheezing sound due to bron -\\nchospasm during expiration; this differs to the inspiratory limitation associated with UA closure. UA closure leads to exercise-induced shortness of breath and a strident sound during inspiration. Patients, however, have significant difficulty in dis -\\ntinguishing a wheeze during expiration from stri -\\ndent inspiration.\\nIn healthy subjects, oxygen delivery is lim -\\nited by the cardiovascular system, not the lungs. Furthermore, the normal respiratory response during a shift from rest to moderate exercise is an increase in ventilation that corresponds with metabolic demand (exercise hyperpnoea ). Due to \\nincreased ventilatory frequency, the level of PaCO\\n2 \\nshould not change when shifting from rest to mod -\\nerate exercise in healthy subjects. The fitness or lack thereof in patients with asthma will influence the level of hyperpnoea, which will increase more quickly in asthmatic patients than in healthy ones. Asthma patients, in general, do not have limited alveolo-capillary diffusion, as found in COPD, and the level of PaCO\\n2 should be unchanged from rest to 400 600\\nDistance MST (m)800 1000 1200 2001020304050(a) (b) (c)\\nr = 0.79; p < 0.001 r = –0.14; p = 0.564VO2 peak (mL· kg –1.min –1)\\n400 600\\nDistance MST (m)800 1000 1200 2001020253035BMI (Kg/m 2)\\n15r = –0.02; p = 0.917\\n400 600\\nDistance MST (m)800 1000 1200 200–4–2024FEV1 (z score)\\nFigure 3.2  Modified shuttle test (MST) and peak oxygen, BMI and level of lung function.

However, hyperventilation dehy -\\ndrates the airway surface, leading to mediator release \\nand bronchoconstriction without change in PaCO2.\\n3.4.3.2  EXERCISE TESTING\\nBaseline fitness levels could be evaluated with the 6MWT or MST. A strong correlation has been found between the MST and VO\\n2peak (r = 0.79) \\nand these values are measured in patients with unstable severe asthma. The main objective of ergometric stress testing, aside from the diagnos -\\ntic evaluation of clinical manifestations (dyspnoea, dizziness, exhaustion, pain, etc.), is to measure parameters relating to exercise physiology to assess performance capacity. The main parameters to be measured and monitored include the perfor -\\nmance achieved (in watts or km/h), heart rate (HR), ECG for ischemic changes, arterial blood pressure (BP), lactate concentration (Lac) and the \\nspiro-   ergometric parameters of oxygen uptake \\n(VO2), which includes carbon dioxide release \\n(VCO2), respiratory quotient (RQ = VO2/VCO2), \\nrespiratory rate (RR), respiratory minute volume (V\\nE), and respiratory equivalent (RE = VE/VO2). \\nCardiovascular fitness can be measured as peak or maximal oxygen uptake (absolute and relative VO\\n2peak/max ) and peak power output (Wpeak). Fitness \\nscore is calculated as VO2peak/kg. When assessed in \\naccordance with guidelines, these measurements are stable (with few exceptions) and can be used to evaluate change over time, from baseline to follow-up or examination change due to treatment.\\nIn clinical and research settings, evaluating the \\nfitness of a patient with asthma is important and can be used when prescribing treatment ( Table 3.4 ).\\n3.4.4   Treating patients with exercise \\nlimitations\\n3.4.4.1  P HARMACOLOGICAL\\nPatients with EIB might need pre-medication before they engage in exertion. This might include: (1) bet -\\nter inflammatory control with, e.g. ICS as bron -\\nchoconstriction occurs due to mediator release by inflammatory cells, (2) one or two puffs of a short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) shortly before exercis -\\ning (3–5 minutes); however, frequent use of a SABA may lead to tachyphylaxis, a form of reduction in drug sensitivity, (3) one puff of a container with a fixed combination of ICS and LABA shortly before exercise (one inhaler treatment strategy) or (4) a tablet of leukotriene antagonist (LTRA) 2 hours before exercise.\\n3.4.4.2  N ON-PHARMACOLOGICAL\\n(1) Patients should warm up with interval train -\\ning to induce smaller amounts of mediator release and develop exercise tolerance. (2) In cold weather, patients with asthma should wear masks to warm up the air and reduce the thermal effect of hyperpnoea. (3) The intensity or frequency of physical activity should be increased; for example, \\nin groups that engaged in 150  mi n per week of \\nmedium-intensity training or 75  mi n per week of \\nhigh-intensity training, no differences were found in the level of fitness gained, as measured by MST, VO\\n2max and reductions in shortness of breath. \\nParticipation in a spinning class three times a week for a period of 8 weeks has been found to be fea -\\nsible for patients with all degrees of asthma, and spinning increases fitness level as measured by VO\\n2max. Interestingly, asthma was more controlled \\nafter this period of training as well. This means that exercise can be used to treat asthma; intensity is not important, but frequency and length are. Exercise also induced lifestyle changes, encourag -\\ning patients with asthma to become more active. (4) The aforementioned study comparing moderate and high-intensity exercise over a 12-month period found that the two types of exercise led to the same amount of weight loss. Other studies have found that a weight loss of 5–10% correlates with better asthma control and probably also reduced need for pharmaceutical asthma therapies.Table 3.4  Indications for cardiopulmonary \\nexercise testing in asthma\\n1) To assess unexplained shortness of breath\\n2) To evaluate disease severity (VO2max)\\n3)  To establish a baseline level of fitness before \\nexercise prescription for pulmonary \\nrehabilitation\\n4)  To identify gas exchange abnormalities \\n(ABPA)\\n5)  To objectively evaluate exercise capacity \\n(VO2max/kg)', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 58}),\n"," Document(page_content='3.5 Overlap between COPD  and asthma 43\\n3.4.5  Patients with exercise \\nlimitations\\nExercise is an important lifestyle change; it is prac -\\ntical, safe and inexpensive.

It is charac -\\nterised by persistent respiratory symptoms, such \\nas cough, sputum, shortness of breath and airflow \\nlimitation. Asthma is also a common chronic air -\\nway disease; it is characterised by varied symptoms \\nsuch as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tight -\\nness and cough and variable airflow obstruction. \\nIn some patients, the two diseases cannot be distin -\\nguished by currently available tests and techniques. \\nFurthermore, the diagnostic criteria for distin -\\nguishing asthma and COPD have not been unified. \\nThe criteria set by GesEPOC and Soler-Cataluna \\nfor comorbidity of asthma and COPD list several \\nfactors: Comorbidity may be present if the airways \\nshow a large degree of variability with an increase \\nin FEV1 of 400 mL or more ( >15% after inhalation \\nof a SABA) or if the patient has a high eosinophil \\ncount or a former history of asthma. A high level \\nof IgE, a history of atopy and a positive reversibility \\ntest with >200 mL and 12% are also possible indica -\\ntions of comorbidity. Two or three of these criteria \\nshould be present. These criteria are similar to the \\nGOLD guidelines as well as the guidelines suggested \\nby Marsh, but the overlap between the criteria sug -\\ngested by GesEPOC and Soler-Cataluna and GOLD \\ncriteria may be as low as 22–28%, and between the \\nformer two and March it is 41–42%\\nThe mechanisms behind asthma and COPD \\ninclude reversibility, suggesting smooth muscle dysfunction and spasms. Significant indications \\nof type-2 inflammation with eosinophils, atopy \\nand a former history of asthma may indicate \\ncomorbidity in patients with COPD.\\n3.5.2  Clinical implications of the \\noverlap between asthma \\nand COPD\\nThe overlap between asthma and COPD is hetero -\\ngeneous, but it can be divided into two clinical phe -\\nnotypes: (1) asthma with fixed airflow limitation \\nand (2) COPD with reversible airway obstruction. \\nEither phenotype may have distinct clinical fea -\\ntures. Different phenotypes of asthma and COPD \\nmust be identified to provide individual, pheno -\\ntype-guided treatment and, thus, achieve the best \\noutcome with the fewest side effects for patients. \\nTherefore, it is clinically useful to distinguish \\nthree entirely different diseases (asthma dominant, \\nCOPD dominant and equal dominance). These dis -\\ntinctions are particularly useful when preventive \\ntherapy is needed.\\nTreating COPD with asthma dominance should \\nfocus on possible type-2 inflammation, whereas \\nCOPD-dominant cases need less treatment for \\ntype-2 inflammation. In some studies, asthma-\\ndominant patients with COPD tended to be young \\nfemales who had smoked less than other partici -\\npants due to a higher sensitivity to smoke; they \\nwere often experiencing the early onset of symp -\\ntoms. They had better lung function than other \\ntypes and a higher FEV1/FVC ratio. Lung function \\ntended to vary more in this type than others. The \\ndisease-  specific questionnaire scores (ACT and \\nCAT) and the levels of comorbidity are similar in \\nthe two groups (asthma and COPD). Interestingly, \\ntype-2-related comorbidities such as CRSwNP \\nare slightly more common in asthma-dominant \\nCOPD patients than in COPD-dominant ones, \\nwho might suffer of CRSsNP. Smoking has been \\nfound to increase the severity of asthma, decrease \\nlung function and increase the number of exacerba -\\ntions. Patients with asthma-dominant COPD had \\nmore exacerbations, especially if they also had low \\nadherence and poor inhaler technic. Patients with \\nasthma dominance responded better to treatment \\nwith ICS, ICS/LABA and LTRA; those with COPD \\ndominance more frequently received LAMA and \\nLABA as single treatments. Asthma-dominant \\npatients received triple treatments more frequently.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 59}),\n"," Document(page_content='44 Extrapulmonary – Treatable traits\\n3.5.3   Recognising the overlap \\nbetween asthma and COPD\\nMost patients with comorbidity of asthma and \\nCOPD are over 40 years old. Some are heavy smok -\\ners, others are not. Chronic airflow limitation with some variability with increased type-2 inflamma -\\ntion should suggest the possibility of comorbidity of asthma and COPD ( Table 3.5 ).\\n3.5.4   Treating patients with asthma \\nand COPD\\nIf there is type-2 inflammation, ICS should be ini -\\ntiated and the effect should be controlled, as this increases the risk of exacerbation. Non-smokers and rare smokers with asthma and COPD are less likely to develop exacerbations, so smoking cessa -\\ntion should be initiated. Furthermore, if there are signs of asthma, treatment should never consist of only LABA or only LAMA.\\n3.5.5  What happens to the patients?\\nThere is a risk that patients with asthma-  do minant \\nCOPD or COPD-dominant asthma may be under -\\ntreated. No data are available about decrease in lung function in this group of patients; however, asthma-dominant COPD has higher levels of FEV\\n1, indicating that the reduction in function is less pronounced than in those with COPD-dominant asthma.\\n3.6  G ASTRO-OESOPHAGEAL \\nREFLUX DISEASE\\nThe incidence of lower airway inflammatory dis -\\nease, such as asthma, with coexisting gastrointesti -\\nnal comorbidities, such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD, has been increasing worldwide. Furthermore, GERD can cause several UA symp -\\ntoms and alter the physiology of the nasopharyn -\\ngeal mucosa, while UA diseases, in turn, might also exacerbate GERD symptoms.\\n3.6.1  GERD and mechanisms\\nIn both lower and UA diseases, inflammatory cells are located in the submucosa and in the epi -\\nthelium. The presence of mast cells and eosino -\\nphils relates to the degree of severity. Release mediators are associated with stimulation from specific cytokines. However, the release of hista -\\nmine and other proinflammatory cytokines from the mast cell, known to cause AHR in asthma, seems to also affect the enteric nerve and smooth muscle function in the gut. Another mechanism proposed for the association of asthma and gas -\\ntrointestinal symptoms is an increase in intesti -\\nnal permeability.\\nThe pathophysiological mechanism for the \\nassociation between asthma and functional gut disorders is unknown, which adds another level of complexity to the management of gastrointestinal disorders. Other gastrointestinal disorders, such as reflux laryngitis and reflux oesophagitis, are independent and show no association with GERD. Eosinophilic oesophagitis with chronic inflamma -\\ntory infiltration of the oesophageal epithelium is not related to GERD but mimics its symptoms.\\n3.6.2   Clinical implications of GERD \\nand asthma\\nOlder patients with asthma have more comor -\\nbidities, including obesity and GERD. Of patients with uncontrolled asthma, more than two-thirds suffer from GERD, especially among those over 70 years old – which is also a group with high Table 3.5  Characteristics of comorbidity of \\nasthma and COPD\\nPossible asthma–\\nCOPD comorbidityUnlikely asthma–COPD comorbidity\\nOlder than 40 years Severe comorbidities \\n(cardiac, hepatic, renal, and other organ dysfunction)\\nPersistent/chronic \\nlung diseaseOther lung disease \\n(ABPA, TB, bronchiectasis, embolism, bronchiolitis)\\nVariable airflow \\nlimitation or AHRRegular OCS and \\nimmunosuppression\\nSmoking Variable\\nEosinophilic \\ninflammationVariable', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 60}),\n"," Document(page_content='3.7 Depression and anxiety with asthma 45\\nrates of obesity.

If there are changes \\nto the voice, flexible nasopharyngoscopy is indi -\\ncated; this might reveal changes in the glottic area, \\nwhich are known to occur with exposure to the \\nproducts of reflux. The gold standard examination \\nin GERD is measurement of impedance or dual-\\nchannel 24-hour pH probe monitoring, especially \\nwhen PPI has no effect.\\n3.6.4 Treating patients with GERD\\nPatients with gastrointestinal symptoms who \\neither respond to PPI therapy or exhibit patho -\\nlogical acid exposure on pH monitoring should be \\ndiagnosed with GERD. In contrast, patients with \\ngastrointestinal symptoms who do not respond to \\nPPI therapy nor exhibit pathological acid exposure \\non pH monitoring should be diagnosed with eosin -\\nophilic oesophagitis. The principle underlying this \\ndistinction is that GERD is the only disease that \\ncan cause oesophageal symptoms and eosinophilia \\nand responds to PPI therapy. PPI treatment should \\nlast up to 8 weeks to thoroughly check whether it is \\neffective or not.\\n3.6.5 What happens to the patients?\\nPatients with uncontrolled asthma should be \\nasked about GERD; most will be symptomatic, \\nbut some might be asymptomatic. Especially with \\nolder patients with uncontrolled asthma, PPI \\ntreatment should be tried for 8 weeks. If there \\nis doubt, patients should be referred for imped -\\nance measurement, or when not possible, 24-hour \\npH monitoring, as some might have eosinophilic \\noesophagitis, which is diagnosed by an esophago-\\ngastro-  duodenoscopy and multiple oesophageal \\nmucosa biopsies often taken 14 cm above the dia -\\nphragmatic level. Currently, topical corticosteroids, \\ndietary modification and oesophageal balloon dila -\\ntion are the primary methods of treatment.3.7  DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY \\nWITH ASTHMA\\nA significantly greater prevalence of depression and \\nanxiety disorders has been demonstrated in patients \\nwith asthma. The current results appear to confirm \\nthe association of asthma with anxiety disorders \\nand, to a lesser degree, with depressive disorders, \\nalthough the data in the literature are somewhat \\ncontradictory. Patients suffering from anxiety and \\ndepressive disorders are more likely to have asthma \\nas well, and these findings are stronger in patients \\nwith more severe mental disorders or more severe \\nrespiratory illness. The causality between asthma \\nand mental disorders is not entirely clear. However, \\nchildren of mothers with mental disorders are more \\nlikely to develop asthma, but children of fathers \\nwith mental disorders are not. Recent studies have \\nsuggested a genetic mechanism between asthma \\nand comorbidity with metal disorders, as a specific \\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) occurs with \\nboth asthma and metal disorders.\\n3.7.1  Clinical implications of \\ncomorbidity of asthma \\nand mental disorders\\nIn asthma management, the patient’s mental state has \\nclinical importance, as this comorbidity can influ -\\nence control of asthma. Lifetime anxiety and depres -\\nsion in asthma patients can affect asthma severity \\nand control and are associated with lower quality \\nof life, lower therapy adherence, smoking, inactiv -\\nity, obesity and increased use of healthcare ser -\\nvices. Therefore, these patients present an increased \\nfinancial burden to healthcare providers. They need \\nmore focus and more frequent follow-up, and they \\nprobably also need access to psychiatric treatment \\nor assistance. Even in the absence of a severe anxi -\\nety disorder, any degree of moodiness (anxiety) can \\nnegatively influence asthma management.\\nFurthermore, a substantial percentage of patients \\nwith difficult-to-treat asthma and low asthma con -\\ntrol, reduced quality of life, higher exacerbation \\nrates and higher rates of unemployment also suf -\\nfer from dysfunctional breathing.

Such \\npatients may often signal disappointment with \\ntheir treatment, distress about their level of ill -\\nness or dissatisfaction with their level of physical \\nability; they may say that few things are right and \\nmany things are wrong. They often refuse to make \\nany additional efforts to resolve their problems and \\ncontinue to feel stressed by their current situations. \\nThey may tend to deny or avoid problems, instead \\nengaging in coping activities, which is counterpro -\\nductive in dealing with stressful situations.\\nThese patients have a reactive lifestyle, elevated \\nlevels of depression and anxiety, and a tendency to \\nfeel instantaneous and powerful emotional reac -\\ntions to stressful situations. This can create confu -\\nsion, which may make it even more difficult for them \\nto find appropriate solutions. They may have or give \\nthe impression that their asthma is uncontrolled and \\nthat they need stronger anti-asthmatic treatment, \\neven if there are no objective signs of uncontrolled \\ndisease and stronger therapies have no effect.\\n3.7.3  Treating of patients with \\nasthma and anxiety or \\ndepression\\nTreating depression with an antidepressant such \\nas Escitalopram in patients with asthma and \\ncomorbid anxiety or depression has been found to \\nreduce asthma severity as measured by an asthma-\\nspecific questionnaire (e.g. the ACQ) and to reduce \\nthe level of anti-asthma therapy needed, including \\nreducing the need for oral steroids.

This prevalence is similar to the preva -\\nlence of smoking in the general population. Some age groups, such as young adults, have a higher smoking prevalence.\\nSmoking is a chronic dependence disorder with \\na high relapse rate. It interacts with obstructive airway disease to increase the disease burden. The illness burden from smoking and asthma can be assessed by measuring smoking-related disability-adjusted life years, termed DALYS. The unit, one DALY, represents a measure of overall disease burden and is expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death. The burden from smoking-related DALYS for asthma is high and is estimated to account for 9.3% of the cumulative 22.8 million DALYS caused by asthma globally.4.1.3  What is the impact of smoking \\non asthma?\\n4.1.3.1   MATERNAL SMOKING AND \\nCHILDHOOD WHEEZE/ASTHMA\\nTobacco smoke exposure impacts asthma at all stages of life, from conception into old age. A baby who is exposed to tobacco smoke whilst in utero has an increased risk of developing wheeze, airway hyperresponsiveness and asthma during child -\\nhood. The association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and asthma or wheeze in pre-school children is estimated to be in the range of OR = 1.25 to OR = 1.85. The effect is strongest for \\nchildhood asthma at 18 months and 4–5 years of age. In children of mothers who stopped smok -\\ning before the first antenatal visit, there was only a slightly increased risk in comparison to non-smokers, supporting the benefit of quitting before or very early in pregnancy ( Figure 4.1 ).\\n4.1.4  Smoking and adult \\nasthma\\nPeople with asthma who smoke have increased morbidity and more severe asthma symptoms, together with accelerated decline in lung function, reduced lung growth, an altered inflammatory phe -\\nnotype and reduced corticosteroid responsiveness.\\nThe Isle of Wight Study investigated asso -\\nciations of\\xa0 asthma\\xa0 and\\xa0 smoking\\xa0 with lung func -\\ntion and airway reversibility across the age range from childhood to early adulthood.

Among nonatopic asthmatics, smoking triples the risk of airflow obstruction; in the atopic asthmatic group, the increase is not neg -\\nligible although it is not statistically significant.There is a dose-response pattern evident for \\nthe impact of smoking on lung function and poor asthma control. In a recent UK study that was designed to evaluate the association between self-report smoking status and asthma control, a total of 3,916 patients from 85 different UK primary care practices completed anonymised questionnaires capturing validated asthma control data (the Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ6]). There was a clear relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked each day and worsening asthma control (F[5,655] = 6.08,\\xa0 P < 0.001; Figure 4.2 ). \\nCurrent smokers had poorer\\xa0asthma\\xa0control, more unscheduled healthcare visits, more rescue courses of oral steroids and higher anxiety and depression scale scores than ex-smokers or never smokers.\\n4.1.5 Tobacco mechanism\\nSmoke from tobacco combustion is a complex mixture of chemicals that exist in the gas phase or are bound to aerosol particles. Over 5,600 unique components have been identified which are esti -\\nmated to account for 99% of the mass of whole smoke. The US Food and Drug Administration classifies 93 of these as harmful or potentially harmful, with 25 further classified as respiratory toxicants ( Table 4.1 ). Polycyclic aromatic hydro -\\ncarbons (PAHs) constituent >500 of the identi -\\nfied compounds in tobacco smoke, 16 of which are carcinogens/possible carcinogens. Other common compounds in tobacco smoke include nicotine, ammonia, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, tar, hydroxyquinone and nitrogen oxides. Amongst chemicals of most concern in a respiratory con -\\ntext are the aldehydes, including acrolein, acetal -\\ndehyde and formaldehyde; the heavy metals such chromium and cadmium and hydrogen cyanide. A common mechanism through which many chemicals mediate their cellular toxicity is through oxidative stress and generation of reactive oxy -\\ngen species (ROS). Generation of species such as hydrogen peroxide, hydroxy radicals and nitrogen dioxide leads to numerous forms of cellular dam -\\nage including RNA, DNA and protein damage and lipid peroxidation.\\nCigarette smoke has a well-established role in \\ndamaging the pulmonary mechanical barriers in addition to the innate and adaptive immune systems.

Many chemical components of cigarette smoke can cross the placenta and have \\nbeen shown to directly impact the developing \\nlungs. Nicotine and its metabolite cotinine appear \\nto be responsible for at least some of these effects, \\nwith fetal levels of these compounds closely mim -\\nicking maternal levels. Sekhon et al. (1999) showed \\nthat nAChR receptors are widely expressed in the \\nnon-human primate lung in the developing lung in \\nairway epithelial cells, cells surrounding large air -\\nways and blood vessels, alveolar type II cells, free \\nalveolar macrophages and pulmonary neuroendo -\\ncrine cells, and these receptors were upregulated \\nin response to nicotine exposure.

Efficacy was assessed using morning \\nand evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) readings, \\nspirometric parameters, bronchial hyper-reactivity \\nand sputum eosinophil counts. After 3 weeks of \\nfluticasone therapy, mean morning PEF reduced \\nfor current smokers while there was a significant increase for non-smokers ( −5 L/min vs 27 L/min, \\nrespectively). While non-smokers receiving fluti -\\ncasone experienced improvements across all end -\\npoints compared with placebo, no differences in \\noutcomes were observed for current smokers receiv -\\ning fluticasone therapy compared with those on \\nplacebo. These data suggest that in mild asthma, \\nactive cigarette smoking impairs the efficacy of \\nshort-term ICS treatment – an important consid -\\neration when managing mild asthma patients who \\nsmoke. This effect does not appear to be reversed \\nby the use of extra-fine ICS preparations. In a post-\\nhoc analysis of the OLIVIA trial, smoking and ex-\\nsmoking asthmatics with and without small airway \\ndisease (SAD) had a similar treatment response \\nwith either extrafine or non-extrafine particle ICS. \\nLonger term use or higher doses may partially over -\\ncome these effects.\\n4.1.7.3  ALTERED INFLAMMATORY \\nPHENOTYPE\\nEx- and current-smokers have less eosinophils \\nand more neutrophils in their sputum and blood \\nthan never-smokers.

Contemplation\\n People in this stage are able to consider  \\nthe possibility of quitting or reducing tobacco use but feel ambivalent about taking the next step.

Preparation\\n At this stage, pave usually made a recent  \\nattempt to change using behaviour within the last year.

The overall \\nassessment is that approved medications for non -\\nsmokers with asthma are also effective for smok -\\ners with asthma. However, because of reduced corticosteroid sensitivity, it may be necessary to use higher doses of ICS in treating asthmatics who smoke. Montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antag -\\nonist is also effective in these patients. Low-dose theophylline and biologics, such as omalizumab, mepolizumab and dupilumab, may improve clini -\\ncal outcomes in smokers with\\xa0 asthma, although never tested due to tobacco often is an exclusion criteria in RCT studies.\\n4.1.10  What happens to the patients?\\nIn patients with asthma who continue to smoke, the risk of developing low level of lung func -\\ntion and COPD is further increased than in non-asthmatic people.\\n4.2  THE ALLERGIC HISTORY – AND \\nALLERGIC ASTHMA\\nSeveral hundred years ago, physicians described symptoms in the upper and lower airways, which are known today as allergic. As early as 1819, these symptoms were described as ‘periodical affection of the eyes and chest’ by a chest physician, who called it Catarrhus aestivus ; today, it is known as \\nhay fever. Periodicity and cause of these symptoms were verified half a century later, when a physi -\\ncian collected a group of patients with symptoms related to airborne pollen. He provoked their eyes, noses and airways with a sample of the pollen and observed sneezing, itchy eyes, coughs and short -\\nness of breath. He also rubbed pollen into a scratch on his arm, which elicited an urticarial reaction. Those allergic reactions are related to something circulating in the serum was confirmed in Dr Prausnitz’s classical experiment. Serum from Küstner, who was allergic to fish, was injected into Prausnitz’s arm. The next day, Prausnitz, was injected with a fish extract in the same place, and, for the first time in his life, he exhibited a positive skin reaction. The antibody responsible for the Prausnitz–Küstner reaction  was named \\nreagin by Coca and Cooke (1923). When differ -\\nent immunoglobulin classes were later identified, attempts were made to relate this new antibody to one of these immunoglobulin classes without success. Ishizaka and Ishizaka purified the new immunoglobulin class, which they named IgE. Independently of them, at the same time, S. G. O. Johansson and Hans Bennich from Sweden dem -\\nonstrated the presence of small amounts of IgE antibodies in normal serum and found IgE to be increased in allergic patients.\\n4.2.1  The allergic mechanism\\nA fundamental property of the immune system is its ability to distinguish between the ‘self’ and the ‘non-self’ – that is, between molecules pro -\\nduced by the ‘self’s’ own genes and those that are not. Specificity is the second key attribute of the immune system. When a non-self-protein pen -\\netrates, e.g. the epithelium, it will act as an antigen, if large enough. The antigen stimulates the immune system to react towards either the entire protein or parts of it. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role in initiating and directing immune responses, serving as sentinels at the mucosal surface between the external and internal environment ( Figure 4.3 ). \\nIn atopic asthma, allergens release proteases, which disrupt the epithelial barrier and induce secretion of interleukin-25 (IL-25), interleukin-33 (IL-33) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) from epithelial cells. IL-33 and TSLP from epithelial cells activate DCs. Activated DCs present antigens to naïve T cells, and this activates the naïve T cells to become Th2 cells, which are the key mediators Table 4.3  The 5A’s approach\\n1.

DCs have been \\nfound in a dense network throughout the epithe -\\nlium of the respiratory tract, including the nose, nasopharynx, large conducting airways, bronchi, bronchioles and alveolar interstitium. DCs exist both above and beneath the basement membrane of the respiratory epithelium, positioning these cells as the first responders to incoming antigens. The lymphocyte is ‘the conductor of the immuno -\\nlogical orchestra’, and, as such, is the most impor -\\ntant cell in the immune system. The B lymphocytes (B cells) develop fully in the bone marrow and migrate directly to the peripheral tissues. When B cells are stimulated by an antigen, they multiply and are transformed into plasma cells, which begin synthesising the antibody against the antigen in question. Antigen stimulation of T lymphocytes causes them to proliferate and differentiate into activated T cells. Some of these act as T helper cells, while others develop into cytotoxic cells or effec -\\ntor cells, which can destroy antigen-containing cells. Activated T cells also produce and release a series of biologically active proteins, cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13) ( Figure 4.3 ). There is \\nnow overwhelming evidence that T cells and cyto -\\nkines play an important role in IgE synthesis. IgE-mediated allergies are called type-1 reactions, and they happen immediately when the body meets the allergen for the second time. Release of IL-4 stim -\\nulates immunoglobulin class switching in B cells so that they produce IgE.

These antigens are traditionally \\ncalled allergens. Antigens are not generally harm -\\nful, but, in predisposed individuals, these anti -\\ngens, when presented by the DCs to the MCs or the \\nnaïve Th cells, cause an immune response. When \\nan allergen reacts with the variable arms (Fab) on \\nthe IgE molecule, attached to a MC, the MC begins \\ndegranulation and the liberation of mediators. This \\nmediator release is followed by increased eosino -\\nphilia, chronic tissue inflammation and allergic \\nsymptoms. Symptoms occur within minutes, and \\nthis type of reaction is, therefore, called an immedi -\\nate reaction. Allergic rhinitis and asthma are based \\non Type I allergic reactions, as is atopic dermatitis \\n(commonly). Atopic diseases are inherited IgE-\\nmediated diseases, which present positive skin \\nprick tests and the symptoms of atopic dermatitis, \\nallergic rhinitis and asthma.\\nThe immunologic response in Type I aller -\\ngies can be used to diagnose the allergies, either \\nby skin prick tests or by measuring the serum \\nlevel of specific IgEs. In allergic asthma, the early \\nbronchial response to allergens causes smooth \\nmuscle contraction within minutes, which can \\nbe prevented and reversed by inhaled beta2 ago -\\nnists and prevented by long-term inhaled steroid \\ntreatment. Leukotriene antagonists effectively \\nprevent the early bronchoconstrictor response to \\nallergen indicating that cysteinyl-leukotrienes are \\na key mediator of this response. In asthma, the \\nbronchial response can develop as an early or late \\nresponse in a typical form of a biphasic curve. This \\nis important because, in allergen provocation\\xa0 – \\neither in a test situation or during environmen -\\ntal provocation with pollen or pet dander\\xa0 – the \\npatients should be told that they can expect a \\nlate response after the early and acute responses. \\nFurthermore, airway inflammation and the atten -\\nuation of the airway hyperresponsiveness remain increased for the following 2 to 3 weeks after the \\ninitial response.\\n4.2.3  How are patients with allergic \\nasthma recognised?\\nPatients suffering from respiratory symptoms \\nshould be submitted to allergy testing. Patients \\nwith allergic asthma often also have either aller -\\ngic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis, a family history \\nof atopy and early onset of asthma. They could \\nalso have increased fractional exhaled nitric oxide \\n(FeNO) above 33 ppb and a high number of blood \\neosinophils often above 0.30 mia/L.\\nPatients with allergic asthma often have air -\\nway hyperresponsiveness towards indirect agents, \\nsuch as mannitol. A detailed history illustrating \\nperiodicity of the respiratory symptoms should be \\ndocumented. Often, patients with allergic asthma \\nhave seasonal variations or specific items that can \\ninduce asthma development, such as pet dander \\nor house dust mites. Patients with allergic asthma \\ncan also experience asymptomatic periods, and, \\nat least in patients with milder asthma, allergen-\\ndriven asthma should be suspected.\\nAn allergen test, either a skin prick test or spe -\\ncific IgE measurements in serum, will often reveal \\nand support the history of allergies.\\n4.2.4 How is allergic asthma treated?\\nIn allergic asthma, it might be possible to elimi -\\nnate the allergen responsible for the variation of \\nsymptoms, the variation in airway hyperrespon -\\nsiveness and the impairment of lung function. \\nHowever, such elimination is seldom possible, and \\nanti-asthma therapy is needed, with an increase in \\ndoses when seasonal variation occurs and provo -\\ncation with specific allergens happens. Doses of \\npreventive inhaled steroids should be increased a \\ncouple of weeks before, for example, pollen season, \\nvisit to summerhouses with dust mites or visits \\nto people who have pets. The high doses should \\nremain in effect for at least 2–3 weeks thereafter, \\nas scientific evidence suggests that increased AHR \\nremains after allergen exposure. Furthermore, \\nlocal or systemic antihistamines have an effect on \\nallergic rhinitis but have no effect on asthma.\\nAllergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the \\nonly modifying anti-asthma treatment as inhaled \\nsteroids control the disease and beta2 agonists ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 72}),\n"," Document(page_content='4.3 Air pollution and the asthmas  57\\nrelieve acute symptoms. In cases of stable, mild–\\nmoderate asthma, with or without allergic rhini -\\ntis, immunotherapy with specific allergens, either subcutaneous (SCIT) or sublingual (SLIT), may be a suitable modifying treatment to alleviate sea -\\nsonal symptoms or prevent the development of new allergies. AIT is often performed with birch, grass, dust mites and, in some cases, pets, although both the dog and the horse allergens used in AIT are less effective. Allergens used in AIT have geo -\\ngraphic variations. For example, ragweed seldom grows in the Nordic countries, whereas Eastern Europe and the United States have a large amount of ragweed. Likewise, in other areas of the world, additional allergens, such as cockroaches and olives, are found. Treatment with more than two allergens, such as birch and grass, or grass and dust mites, seldom makes sense, although there are few, if any, scientific studies concerning the number of allergens to select. Earlier clinical views held that, in patients with multiple allergic symptoms, AIT is not relevant. However, AIT for grass and dust mites in patients who also have pet allergies could certainly make sense, as pets could be elimi -\\nnated from the patients’ environment, and the AIT treatment could lead to a stable clinical situation. Unstable asthma is a contraindication for AIT, whereas pregnancy is not. However, AIT should never be initiated in pregnant women, but AIT maintenance is safe, often because doses of 0.8 mL of 100,000 SQ units are selected, instead of 1.0 mL.\\n4.2.5   What happens to patients \\nwith allergic asthma?\\nPatients with early asthma onset often have allergic asthma during childhood, more frequently found in boys. Frequently, they also have allergic rhini -\\ntis and atopic dermatitis. However, allergic asthma could also be the only sign of disease. During their teenage period, many with childhood asthma go into remission, with either no symptoms or minor symptoms during respiratory infections. Asthma may relapse during their 20s or 30s, and, at this time, it is often non-allergic asthma, which more frequently is found in women. Relapse later in life can be both eosinophilic-driven or non-eosino -\\nphilic driven, the latter of which is often seen in lightly obese women.\\nAIT treatment for seasonal allergies, in which \\nthe relief of seasonal symptoms either disappears or substantially diminishes, has a modifying effect on the disease – in which case reduced anti-asthma treatment is needed. Furthermore, AIT in patients with allergic rhinitis, e.g. grass allergies, has been proven to reduce the development of asthma in children and young adults, and, furthermore, in mono-allergen allergic diseases, development of new allergies has been prevented.\\n4.3  AIR POLLUTION AND \\nTHE ASTHMAS\\n4.3.1  What happens in the airways?\\nAround 91% of the world’s population are living in areas where the levels of air pollutants exceed the WHO limits. There are many different types of airborne pollution ( Table 4.5 ), but simplistically \\nthese can be divided into gasses and particulate matter (PM). PM is considered as particularly dan -\\ngerous as respirable particles can remain airborne over large distances. Air pollution is also consid -\\nered from the perspective of indoor and outdoor pollution.\\nEpidemiological studies demonstrated a strong \\nassociation between pulmonary disease and PM exposure. Compared to cigarette smoking which can be avoided through quitting, the dangers of airborne pollution are hard to avoid in heavily polluted countries, such as China and India. In China, 74,000 premature deaths were attributed to PM\\n2.5\\xa0exposure in the year 2013. It was estimated \\nthat 22% of these deaths could have been avoided if indoor PM\\n2.5\\xa0level met National Class I standards.\\nAs shown in\\xa0 Table 4.6 , prenatal PM exposure \\nis associated with childhood asthma. A cohort study found that prenatal PM\\n10\\xa0 exposure could \\ncause pulmonary function changes with higher minute ventilation in newborns. Another birth cohort study including pre-school and school-age children demonstrated that prenatal PM\\n10\\xa0 expo -\\nsure increased the risk of developing asthma in both age groups, especially for those children whose mothers lived near the highways during pregnancy. The correlation between maternal PM exposure and asthma risk in different genders was also investigated. High levels of PM\\n2.5\\xa0 exposure \\nduring mid-gestation increased the development of asthma by the age of 6 years in boys, but not in girls. The above evidence indicates that maternal PM exposure during pregnancy has similar effects ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 73}),\n"," Document(page_content='58 Risk factors – Treatable traits\\nto MSE in terms of increasing the risks of develop -\\ning asthma in childhood ( Table 4.6 ).\\n4.3.2  Pollution mechanism\\nAirborne pollution is generally categorised into \\ngases and PM with PM regarded as the most dan -\\ngerous form due to the large distances that particles can travel. The size of particles relevant to the respi -\\nratory tract is below 10 µm in aerodynamic diam -\\neter (PM10). PM10 particles are deposited mainly in the upper respiratory tract, whilst those <2.5 µm \\ncan reach the lung alveoli. Nanoparticles ( <100 nm) \\nare also particularly damaging to the airways due to their high surface area to mass ratio and their organic and metal contamination, which is primar -\\nily derived from traffic exhaust. Nanoparticles have been shown to penetrate alveolar macrophages, the alveolar wall and visceral pleura.\\nOther major sources of PM include factories, \\nmanufacturing and power plants, incinerators, construction activity, fires and windblown dust. The composition of PM demonstrates temporal and spatial variability, but with common major compo -\\nnents being metals, organic compounds including PAHs, biological components, nitrate, ammonia, sulphate ions and carbon particles.

PM 2.5–10 are thought to be retained in the lung alveoli where they adhere to the surface of pulmonary epithelial cells. Here, redox-mediated mechanisms cause acute inflammation, oxida -\\ntive stress and damage to DNA, RNA, proteins and membrane lipids. In vitro human and animal models indicate PM can activate MAPK pathways leading to NF- κB and other proinflammatory sig -\\nnalling pathways, as well as proteinases that lead to destruction of the extracellular matrix.\\nAnimal models have shown that different com -\\nponents of PM, even within the same class (e.g. heavy metals) have different biological effects on airway cells. For example, in mice, exposure to PAHs and elemental nickel lead to increased apop -\\ntosis and IL-1beta release whilst iron and chro -\\nmium were more likely to cause DNA damage. In a rat lung, model ultrafine particles of carbon and cobalt induced an influx of neutrophils, which was delayed for ultrafine Ni and absent for Titanium. The observed inflammatory response was consistent with the pattern of surface free radical generation.\\nBiologically derived components of PM include \\nendotoxins which are lipopolysaccharides from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Challenge with endotoxin aerosol causes increased neutrophil and lymphocyte levels in BAL fluid. Endotoxins can also bind to the CD14/TLR4/MD2 receptor complex on macrophages to trigger the production of inflammatory cytokines.\\n4.3.2.1  I NTRAUTERINE AIR POLLUTION\\nNumerous epidemiological studies have demon -\\nstrated\\xa0that prenatal PM exposure is also associated with childhood asthma. Like MSE, PM exposure during pregnancy can impair fetal lung develop -\\nment by directly affecting fetal development and/or indirect influence on placental function.\\nMany toxicants present on the surface of PM \\ncan cross the blood-placental barrier, including heavy metals and PAHs. As discussed in Section \\n4.1.1 , the developing fetus is especially prone to \\noxidative injury, as antioxidant defences remain immature through pregnancy. Pups exposed to PM\\n2.5\\xa0during gestation demonstrate impaired lung \\nfunction, with alveolar destruction and thickened alveoli septum and maternal PM\\n2.5\\xa0exposure corre -\\nlates with increasing levels of pup oxidative stress and markers of oxidative stress in pup lung tissue.\\nIn vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that PM \\ninduces neutrophils, eosinophils as well as macro -\\nphages in the lungs by activating pro-inflammatory cytokines which trigger a series of inflammatory responses. In women exposed to PM\\n2.5 particles, \\nearly gestation was associated with increased per -\\ncentages of T lymphocytes and reduced percentages of B lymphocytes and NK cells. Interestingly, in late gestation, reduced percentages of T lymphocytes and increased percentages of B lymphocytes and NK cells were observed. Th1/Th2 imbalances have also been observed, for example, diesel exhaust PM has been shown to increase the Th2 cell percentage in BAL fluid and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the offspring that have asthma. This balance has been observed to vary between studies which may be a result of the variation in components present in different PM samples.\\nSimilar to tobacco smoke exposure, epigenetic \\nchanges may underlie the association between pre -\\nnatal PM exposure and reduced lung function in Table 4.6  Maternal PM exposure and the development of asthma in offspring \\nPollutant Age Concentration increase Relative risk References\\nPM2.5 6 years 1.7 µg/m3 (per IQR) 1.15 (1.03–1.26) Lee et al., 2018\\nPM2.5 3–4 years 1 µg/m3 (exposure interval) 0.95 (0.91–1.00) Clark et al., 2009\\nPM2.5 0–5 years 1.45 µg/m3 (per IQR) 0.99 (0.97–1.01) Sbihi et al., 2016\\nPM2.5 6–10 years 1.46 µg/m3 (per IQR) 1.01 (0.97–1.06) Sbihi et al., 2016\\nPM2.5 0–6 years 3.7 µg/m3 (per IQR) 1.01 (0.99–1.04) Lavigne et al., 2018\\nPM10 3–6 years 12 µg/m3 (per IQR) 0.89 (0.68–1.16) Deng et al., 2016\\nPM10 3–4 years 1 µg/m3 (exposure interval) 1.09 (1.05–1.13) Clark et al., 2009\\nPM10 0–5 years 1.3 µg/m3 (per IQR) 1.12 (1.05–1.19) Sbihi et al., 2016\\nPM10 6–10 years 1.36 µg/m3 (per IQR) 1.09 (0.96–1.24) Sbihi et al., 2016\\nSource:  Wang et al.

Influenza infection can be treated with oseltamivir. Atypical infections can be treated with antibiotics such as macrolides or tetracyclines.

Obesity is becoming increasingly common and it is associated with an increased risk of asthma. It is a progressive and relapsing condition that can begin in childhood. There are several different mechanisms through which obesity can worsen asthma.\\nObesity results in extrapulmonary thoracic \\nrestriction leading to altered pulmonary mechan -\\nics. The earliest change in static lung volumes is a reduction in end-expiratory reserve volume. Obesity can also lead to airway closure during tidal breathing. This results in the loss of the ‘physiolog -\\nical breathing space’, that is the gap between tidal airflow and maximal expiratory airflow.\\nObesity induces pro-inflammatory changes such as \\nincreased production of adipokines and pro-inflam -\\nmatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, TNF- α) by adipose tissue. \\nThese cytokines cause a low-grade systemic inflam -\\nmatory response and can induce a non-eosinophilic or neutrophilic airway inflammatory response.Obesity is associated with comorbidities such as \\ndepression and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease which can also worsen the clinical manifestations of asthma.\\n4.5.2   How does obesity cause \\nclinical implications?\\nWhen obesity complicates asthma, patients report increased symptoms, poorer asthma control, more frequent exacerbations and a poorer quality of life. There is also increased use of oral steroids, increased urgent healthcare visits and lower lung function.\\nThere is an obese asthma phenotype that is \\nconsistently identified in studies adopting a clus -\\nter analysis approach. This cluster involves obese women who have late-onset severe asthma, with a high symptom expression, use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, a normal eosinophil count and an airway inflammatory pattern that is either mixed granulocytic or neutrophilic.\\n4.5.3  How do you recognise obesity?\\nObesity is assessed by measuring both body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Waist cir -\\ncumference is a good predictor of visceral adiposity, with abdominal obesity associated with an increased risk of a number of diseases including cardiovascu -\\nlar disease, diabetes and cancer. BMI can be used to stratify treatment approaches ( Figure 4.4 ). BMI > 25 \\nindicates a person is overweight. BMI >30 indicates \\nFigure 4.4  The obesity stepped approach.

An additive \\napproach is recommended, with more invasive approaches reserved for those with the highest BMIs. Lifestyle change should be recommended to all obese people with asthma. This includes reduc -\\ning energy intake, increasing physical activity and counselling for behaviour change. A very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) can be considered for those with a BMI >30 if required. Referral to a specialist \\nservice to receive advice regarding bariatric sur -\\ngery may be considered in people with a BMI >40, \\nor >35 in the presence of at least two significant \\nobesity-related comorbidities.\\n4.5.5  What happens to the patients?\\nAsthma incidence is increased in obesity. Obesity magnifies to the illness burden of asthma. Obesity can modify asthma control, leading to poorer asthma control and a reduced response to treat -\\nment. It can modify asthma phenotype, leading to a non-eosinophilic phenotype. There is no current evidence whether asthma leads to development of obesity, or obesity leads to asthma.\\n4.6 A DHERENCE\\nThe terms compliance  and adherence  are commonly \\nused, both in lay terms and in the scientific litera -\\nture, when describing how subjects follow treat -\\nment schedules. Compliance comes from the Latin complere , meaning the ‘fulfil or keep a plan’, while \\nadherence is based on the Latin adhaerere , meaning \\n‘to stick to’. The difference between the two terms is that compliance  means ‘to keep to the plan as dic -\\ntated by the doctor’ or ‘to do as told’, while adherence  means ‘to keep the contract tight’ or ‘to stick to what is established between two partners’. Adherence involves both patient and doctor, but compliance involves only the doctor in the decision. In current medical praxis, the collaboration between patients and the physician is more often based on a common agreement (adherence) than on a dictation of what to do (compliance). Therefore, in the following sec -\\ntions, the term adherence  will be used.\\n4.6.1  Adherence mechanism\\nPatient activation is considered the most reliable indicator of their ability to autonomously man -\\nage their health, although the documented role of psychosocial factors in promoting patient acti -\\nvation in good or increased adherence is limited. Furthermore, the quality of the emotions patients experience in relation to their personal illnesses may substantially impact patient activation levels. One model suggested for examining these emo -\\ntional issues related to adherence is the Patients’ Health Engagement (PHE) model. It is recom -\\nmended due to its ability to capture the psycholog -\\nical journey of patient engagement – the impact of the quality of emotions and of the perceived quality of the relationship between patients and healthcare providers. Psychological adjustment plays an essential role in how patients can (or can -\\nnot) cope with their illness, and the management of chronic disease influences their possibilities and choice to become ‘leader[s] of their disease and care’. The transition from a passive approach to active behaviour in managing health and care is based on a complex process of meaning-making and self-identity elaboration, which is very emo -\\ntional. This emotional behaviour is sometimes irrational, based on the individuals’ insights about themselves and on whether their subjective view -\\npoints of their quality of life are disease-specific or more general. In this regard, the PHE model has demonstrated quite an interesting predictive power for the level of patients’ adherence to medi -\\ncal prescriptions.\\n4.6.2   How does adherence cause \\nclinical implications?\\nAdherence to medical therapy can be a difficult task, and lack of adherence is a serious problem. Prescribed medication is developed to be taken ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 80}),\n"," Document(page_content='4.6 A dherence  6 5\\neither at certain strict intervals and doses or when \\nneeded. Poor adherence to medications is com -\\nmon. Indeed, up to 60% of subjects with chronic illnesses adhere poorly to the prescribed therapy. Non-adherence applies both to respiratory medi -\\ncations prescribed and to non-pharmacologic actions with disease controlling possibilities, such as physical training, weight loss or other lifestyle changes. Non-adherence, especially to pharmaco -\\nlogic prescriptions, is frequent in both adults and adolescents but is of minor importance among children whilst they are under parental supervi -\\nsion. In respiratory medicine, the type and for -\\nmulation of the anti-asthma therapy, the patients’ perceptions of their chronic respiratory situations and the patients’ acceptance of education about their diseases are important tools in disease man -\\nagement. Non-adherence is not positively related to disease severity, indicating that even severe asthma patients have a lack of adherence. Furthermore, adherence can be both intentional and accidental or unplanned ( Table 4.9 ). In one study, acciden -\\ntal and intentional non-adherence with controller medication, at least twice a week, was reported to occur in 27% and 24%, respectively, of the sampled population, and more than half of the patients with asthma stated they were non-adherent and had stopped their controller treatment because they were ‘ free of their asthma symptoms ’ (Table 4.9 ). \\nWhen the goal of asthma management is reaching well-controlled asthma, with no asthma symptoms, this is contradictory. According to the guidelines, asymptomatic patients should probably have their controller medication changed or decreased, or, as suggested in the new GINA guidelines, they should use a fixed combination of controller therapy when needed. These changes should be outlined in each patient’s personal treatment plan – called an action plan. Failure to follow action plans and recommen -\\ndations results from different emotional and psy -\\nchosocial factors, and it seems to be a behaviour that could be altered with a little educational effort from caregivers.\\n4.6.3   How is non-adherence \\nrecognised?\\nMedication adherence failure leads to substantial worsening of disease, death and increased health -\\ncare costs. In other words, non-adherence affects both the individual patients and the healthcare system. Patients suffering from unstable asthma might have unstable asthma due to undertreat -\\nment, and they might have severe asthma despite high doses of controller therapy. However, a large group of patients suffer from unstable asthma due to lack of adherence – either accidental or inten -\\ntional non-adherence – which causes uncontrolled disease.\\nVerification of uncontrolled disease in asthma \\nmanagement requires: (1) objective asthma mea -\\nsurements, such as lung function and FeNO and (2) use of an asthma questionnaire, such as the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) or others. In cases presenting elevated ACQ scores – e.g. over 1.2 – a low level of lung function and a high level of FeNO, there is an indication of low asthma control. In patients suffering from uncontrolled asthma, there is disagreement about the level of disease and treatment for most patients. This dis -\\nagreement could be due to patients’ non-adherent attitudes. The first question to be asked of patients would normally be: ‘Do you take your treatment?’ or ‘Do you take your treatment as prescribed?’ In case of negative response to these questions, the evaluation must assess the quality of the patients’ emotional feelings and of how they perceive the quality of their relationship with their healthcare providers. It must be determined whether this non-adherences to treatment are due to a lack of knowledge about the pathology of the disease (edu -\\ncation); a lack of acceptance of having a chronic disease (psychological support) or treatment type, doses, frequency and rescue medication (relation -\\nship between patient and healthcare providers). \\nTable 4.9  Non-adherence behaviour related to \\nan intentional action\\n• No respiratory symptoms (i.e. well \\ncontrolled asthma)(56%)\\n• Ran out of medication (19%)\\n• Disapproved of being on regular \\nmedication(13%)\\n• Were taking too many other \\nmedications(12%)\\n• Feared side effects (9%)\\n• Did not want to perceive \\nthemselves as ‘ill’(5%)\\n• Feared dependence on asthma \\nmedication(4%)', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 81}),\n"," Document(page_content='66 Risk factors – Treatable traits\\nEvaluation of non-adherence, both intentional and \\naccidental, requires documentation of the actual \\nlevel of treatment. In some countries, it is possi -\\nble to obtain data from the pharmacy concerning \\nthe level of treatment ‘handed over the counter’, \\nbut not the level of treatment taken. The level of \\ntreatment taken could, in some cases, be measured \\nwith an automated device attached to the inhaler, \\noften used in pharmaceutical drug trials, but such \\na device is seldom available in ordinary treat -\\nment situations. With the knowledge of the drug \\namount used, evaluation of the level of adherence \\nis possible, and communication between patients \\nand staff concerning adherence is feasible.\\n4.6.4 How is non-adherence treated?\\nAdherence to medication is an essential compo -\\nnent of health outcomes, so, by increasing medi -\\ncation adherence, patient outcomes may also be \\nimproved. Even the most carefully chosen and \\noptimal medication can be rendered ineffective by \\ninsufficient adherence. Termination of intentional \\nor accidental non-adherence requires a combina -\\ntion of patient education and psychosocial support. \\nThis agrees with patients wanting more knowl -\\nedge about their disease, wondering why specific \\ndrugs have been selected over others and having \\na considerable interest in finding out how to treat \\nthemselves self-sufficiently. Patients’ unintentional \\nnon-adherent behaviour could likely be reduced \\nby their receiving a daily electronic reminder, like \\na text message, asking whether they have remem -\\nbered to take the medication or via other electronic \\napps or non-electronic reminder devices. Another \\nimportant psychological factor might be resolving \\ntreatment likes or, especially, treatment dislikes. \\nSeveral earlier studies have shown that patients \\nprefer tablets to inhalations and prefer aerosols \\nto powder inhalations; when giving patients their \\npreferred choices, treatment adherence increases. \\nHowever, this has not been shown in other studies. \\nLastly, it has been found that using fixed combi -\\nnations of inhaled steroids and long-acting beta2 \\nagonists (FC-ICS/LABA) is superior to other treat -\\nment regimes. Guidelines tend to pool patients \\ntogether and treat them in a one-size-fits-all man -\\nner, but personalised monitoring and treatment \\nplans would likely better suit each individual \\npatient. Prescribing FC-ICS/LABA as needed, \\nwithout prescribing short-acting beta2 agonists, as currently suggested in the 2022 GINA guide -\\nlines, would increase adherence to ICS because this \\ninhaler would be the one patient have – a matter \\nof action which is supported by scientific evidence.\\nPatient education seems to provide the best \\nopportunity for improving adherence. Counselling \\nmight also help. The staff with the best success is \\ndifficult to determine, but it seems that pharma -\\ncists have better success. Physicians are the inter -\\nventionists, and the intervention itself has failed \\nto show improvement in adherence. Reminder \\ninterventions, directly observed treatment, web-\\nbased programmes and interventions performed \\nby physicians have also failed to affect adherence, \\nbut simplified dosing, patient education and coun -\\nselling with and without pharmacists prescribing \\nmedications have shown mixed effects.\\n4.6.5 What happens to the patients?\\nNon-adherence leads to unstable asthma, with \\nincreased risk of exacerbation, chronicity of the \\nreduced level of lung function and emotional dysco -\\nordination between doctor and patients. The patients \\nmay feel they are lying to their healthcare providers, \\nand, if the non-adherence is discovered, the doc -\\ntors or respiratory nurses may feel they have been \\ndeceived. If the non-adherence remains untold, the \\npatients risk further increase in doses of anti-asthma \\nmedication due to unstable asthma, increased level \\nof FeNO, possible lower levels of lung function and \\nthe prescription of less desirable treatments.\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\nAdministration USFDA. https://www.fda.gov/\\ntobacco-products/rules-regulations-and-\\nguidance/harmful-and-potentially-harmful-\\nconstituents-tobacco-products-and-tobacco-\\nsmoke-established-list2012 .

When the allergen that is introduced into the skin interacts with mast cell–bound IgE in the submucosa, it induces a wheal-and-flare reaction (oedema and erythema), which can be easily measured. Skin testing provides an estimate of the amount of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, but the result also depends on the cells’ ability to release mediators and the tissue’s sensitivity to them. Skin testing can be used as the principal tool for confirming suspected IgE-mediated disease in the airways, eyes, skin and gut. IgE antibodies, which may well be produced locally, are distributed to all parts of the body by plasma and tissue fluid; the sensitisation is generalised. The skin prick test is recommended for initial screening due to its simplicity, rapidity of performance, low cost and high specificity.\\nSpecific IgE:  Detection of allergen-specific \\nIgE antibodies in serum and other material can be done by, e.g. the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) or other laboratory tests, such as ImmunoCap. There is an almost 100% correlation between the skin prick test and specific IgE measurements if the batch of allergen extract used is the same, the patient has allergies and a reliable laboratory method is used.\\nAllergen provocation:  Allergen provocation is \\nused when more than one suspected allergen is the cause of the disease. Provocation can be used to measure the magnitude of response to different allergens and not only a response to an allergen (disease versus sensitivity). The allergen in question can be applied to the eye, nose or airways. The local response is a result of interaction between the allergen applied and the mast cells in the selected organ. Allergen provocation can be used both as a diagnostic measurement tool and as a tool to measure the response to treatment. However, the result is difficult to use in research because it represents a dichotomic response.\\n5.1.1 M ethods of allergen diagnosis\\nSkin prick testThe skin prick test is a safe, standardised test that can be done in most patients with suspected allergic respiratory disease. A drop of glycerin -\\nated extract  (50% glycerol, 10 histamine equiv -\\nalent prick [HEP]) is placed on the skin; the epidermis is then punctured with a 1-mm lancet. Only about 5 μ L of the extract is introduced into \\nthe skin, so the risk of an anaphylactic reaction is extremely low. The test is quick and virtually painless, and the results can be seen 12 minutes after puncturing the skin. Any wheal reactions can be outlined with a fine marker and trans -\\nferred to paper with transparent tape. The reac -\\ntion to each allergen is regarded as positive if the mean wheal diameter [(d1 +d2)/2] is at least \\n3 mm. The test has a significant specificity, but lower sensitivity, with the sensitivity increasing in line with an increased wheal diameter (e.g. 5 mm). The precision of the test can be improved with repetition; preferably, the prick test will be done in duplicate  on both sides of the ‘number ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 85}),\n"," Document(page_content='70 Diagnostic tests in respiratory medicine\\nBOX 5.1 : HDM: House dust mite\\n ●Standardised allergen extracts, with a \\nconsistent overall potency, are preferable.\\n ●Antihistamine medication must be discon -\\ntinued before testing.\\n ●A positive skin test occurs in 30% or more \\nof unselected young adults.\\n ●A prick test wheal of 3 mm is immunologi -\\ncally specific.\\n ●A wheal of 5 mm or larger increases the \\ndiagnostic sensitivity.\\n ●A specific IgE value of 0.035 kU/L is \\npositive; higher diagnostic sensitivity with \\n0.070 kU/L.\\n ●Allergen provocation is often done to \\nconfirm clinical importance.\\n ●Allergen eye provocation is often done in \\ncases with suspected HDM allergies.tape’ or other type of tape to separate the drops of \\nallergens.

Th2 inflammation is associated with a high level of FeNO, and although FeNO is produced by the epithelial cells in the airways, it correlates with eosinophils in sputum, bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL), bronchial biopsies and blood – at least in the higher values of eosino -\\nphilic cell count ( Figure 5.1 ).\\nFeNO is recommended to define the inflam -\\nmatory phenotype, type-2 inflammation, of asthma. FeNO is high in type-2 asthma and low in non-type-2 asthma. There are some obstacles to its use: FeNO can also be elevated in eosino -\\nphilic bronchitis and allergic rhinitis, where it likely represents associated lower airway eosino -\\nphilic inflammation. FeNO will usually be low in persons with asthma who smoke and those with a high BMI. FeNO does not correlate closely with measures of airway responsiveness, lung func -\\ntion or symptoms, indicating that it identifies a treatable trait that is distinct from these pro -\\ncesses. FeNO should not be viewed as a diagnos -\\ntic test for asthma. FeNO identifies eosinophilic inflammation and likely responsiveness to cor -\\nticosteroid and is valuable in monitoring disease and titrating corticosteroid treatment. FeNO has been shown to increase with reduced adher -\\nence to ICS and reduces quickly with supervised ICS use in non-adherent patients. The so-called FeNO suppression test can be a useful means to identify poor treatment adherence. Finally, a meta-analysis has shown that asthma manage -\\nment following algorithms that included FeNO monitoring compared with no FeNO reduced the risk of exacerbations but did not affect other outcomes, such as hospitalisation or quality of life. Several analyses have shown that FeNO monitoring for asthma management is cost effective and could result in increased QALYs and decreased healthcare costs associated with asthma management without FeNO. Non-type-2 asthma with low FeNO requires less ICS treat -\\nment and more beta2 agonist to control the dis -\\nease. Although produced by the epithelial cells, FeNO is considered an easy and non-invasive marker of airway inflammation, including the \\nFigure 5.1  FeNO and the related cytokines.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 87}),\n"," Document(page_content='72 Diagnostic tests in respiratory medicine\\nlevel of inflammation and the change in inflam -\\nmation. Accordingly, it is often used in research \\nsettings. The clinical use of the FeNO test is with medication class selection (i.e. ICS use) and ICS dose titration.\\n5.2.1  Method for measuring FeNO\\nWhen performing the FeNO test, the individual inhales air without NO, followed by a 7- to 10-s exhalation, maintaining a constant flow rate of 0.05 L/s; values are measured online, and most equipment provides real-time gas analysis. FeNO is a continuous variable; it should be measured three times, and the mean of the three concen -\\ntrations should be registered, at least in research, whereas most clinicians measure FeNO once per visit. FeNO is measured with the Nitric Oxide Analyzer portable equipment (NIOX VERO; Circassia, Sweden/US/UK and Vivatmo from Bosch/DE) or a stationary version of the equip -\\nment, such as CLD88sp (Ecomedics/DE). With FeNO measured using CLD88, the values are saved for later analysis, whereas this is not the case for the portable equipment. Furthermore, CLD88 can be used with a flow of 0.05 L/s (bronchial flow) and 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 L/s (alveolar flow), indicating NO in the peripheral airways. Finally, some equipment works offline (exhaled gas is collected during tidal breathing into an impermeable bag, where the gases are subsequently analysed). This option does not provide real-time gas values and is seldom used in a clinical setting.\\nEquipment list\\n ●VERO, Vivatmo, CLD88\\n ●Mouthpieces and Nose clip\\n ●Should be done before FEV1 or challenge tests\\n ●Mean value of three measurements\\n ●No differences between sitting and standing\\n5.2.2  Analysing FeNO\\nThe higher the values of FeNO, the higher the odds of \\ntype-2 airway inflammation. In a patient with respi -\\nratory symptoms with a high level of FeNO (e.g. 50 ppb), there is a strong likelihood of the patient hav -\\ning type-2 inflammation, particularly if the blood eosinophil count is also high. There is evidence that the blood eosinophil count and FeNO have additive predictive and prognostic values, likely because they identify different components and compartments of type-2 inflammation, with FeNO reflecting airway epithelial derived chemotactic pull of eosinophils (the magnet, see Figure 5.2 ) and blood eosinophils \\nthe systemic reservoir of eosinophils that could potentially respond to that chemotactic signal (the bomb; see Figure 5.2 ).\\nFigure 5.2  Inflammation.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 88}),\n"," Document(page_content='5.3 Inflammatory cell counts: Eosinophilic and neutrophilic cells  73\\nThe combination of FeNO and blood eosino -\\nphils has been used to derive a risk score for asthma \\nattacks ( Figure 5.3 ).

FeNO is a cost-effective test, and it is valuable in the clinical setting as a diagnostic tool for inflam -\\nmation, measurement of anti-asthma treatment efficacy and adherence to ICS. In the research set -\\nting, FeNO can be measured at baseline and during follow-up. It can be combined with other measure -\\nments and followed daily or monthly, at home or in the clinic. FeNO is produced by a specific mecha -\\nnism induced by IL13, and it can be followed alone or as part of type-2 inflammation.\\n5.3  INFLAMMATORY CELL \\nCOUNTS: EOSINOPHILIC \\nAND NEUTROPHILIC CELLS\\nThe blood eosinophil count can be helpful in iden -\\ntifying type-2 inflammation. A normal count is \\nfound in about 50% of asthma patients visiting an out-patient clinic due to a non-eosinophilic asthma phenotype. Some patients with COPD have been also found to have higher levels of blood and sputum EOS and this finding is associated with frequent exacerbations. An increased eosinophil number is predictive of responsiveness to both steroid and bio -\\nlogical therapy (anti-IL-5 and anti-IgE monoclonal antibody therapy). There is a strong significant pos -\\nitive relationship between blood eosinophil param -\\neters and the percentage of the sputum eosinophil count. A weak but significant correlation has been found between the sputum neutrophil percentage and blood neutrophil percentage ( r = 0.219). ROC \\ncurve analysis identified that the blood eosinophil percentage count was the best predictor for eosino -\\nphilic asthma, with an AUC of 0.907 ( p < 0.001). \\nThe absolute blood eosinophil count was also highly predictive for asthma, with an AUC of 0.898 (p < 0.0001) at a blood eosinophil cut-off 0.26 10\\n9/L. \\nThe blood eosinophil/lymphocyte ratio (ELR) and eosinophil/neutrophil ratio (ENR) were increased in eosinophilic asthma, and the neutrophil/lym -\\nphocyte ratio (NLR) was increased in neutrophilic asthma, often defined as non-eosinophilic asthma. Neutrophilic asthma could also be detected by blood neutrophil percentages, NLR and low FNO <20 ppb, but with less accuracy.\\nThe optimum cut-off point for the blood eosin -\\nophil percentage has been suggested as 2.7%, and this yielded a sensitivity of 92.2% and a specificity of 75.8%; other studies have suggested that cut-off values of blood cell count of ≥0.150, ≥0.300 \\nor ≥0.450 × 10\\n9/L are predicable for increasing \\nFigure 5.3  The Oxford Risk of Asthma attaCk scaLE (ORACLE).', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 89}),\n"," Document(page_content='74 Diagnostic tests in respiratory medicine\\nseverity of diseases, indicated by the number of \\nexacerbations.

The terminology has gradually shifted from \\n‘Th2-cell-high’ asthma to ‘type-2-high’ asthma, \\nincluding both Th2 cells and ILC2s. Th2 cells are \\ninvolved in producing IL4, IL5, IL10 and IL13, as \\nwell as antigen-specific IgE and IgG1. The role of \\nILC2s, as a source of type-2 cytokines and regula -\\ntors of disease severity in human asthma, is an area \\nof active research. Currently, IL5 and IL13 are pre -\\ndominant cytokines, whereas IL4 is less important. \\nThe best-known endotype of asthma is type-2-high \\nasthma, characterised by airway and blood eosino -\\nphilia and the presence of biomarkers that depend \\non the type-2 cytokine IL13, such as periostin in \\nserum and NO in exhaled breath (FeNO). Periostin \\nand nitric oxide are both mainly produced by air -\\nway epithelial cells that express IL4R α, and thus, \\nrespond to IL4 and/or IL13. Furthermore, TSLP is \\nan epithelial cell–derived cytokine synthesised in \\nresponse to various stimuli, an upstream alarmin, \\nincluding protease allergens and microorganisms \\nlike viruses and bacteria. It is considered a master \\nregulator of type-2 immune responses at the bar -\\nrier surfaces of skin and the respiratory/gastroin -\\ntestinal tract.\\nType-2-high inflammation in patients tends to \\nmanifest with high numbers of airway and blood \\neosinophilia, as well as cytokines like IL4, IL5, \\nIL13 and TSLP, but relatively low concentrations \\nof serum IgE. These type-2-high patients with \\nasthma are less responsive to steroids and fre -\\nquently have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal pol -\\nyposis (CRSwNP), as well as mucus plugs in their \\nlower airways.\\nThe mechanism of type-2-low inflammation is \\ndominated by airway neutrophilia. Neutrophilia \\nhas been shown to depend on IL8, IL17 and/or \\ngranulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). \\nProduction of IL8 is increased in some asthma \\npatients, but although these cells seem to circulate \\nin the bloodstream, clinical asthma studies that \\nhave looked for IL17 transcripts, IL17 gene signa -\\ntures or IL17 proteins have not consistently found \\nthese signals in the airways. The cytokine produc -\\ntion by Th17 cells is notoriously resistant to inhi -\\nbition by steroids, which has led to an attractive \\nhypothesis that neutrophil-rich Th17 cell–driven \\ninflammation is the pathological correlate of \\nsteroid-resistant asthma.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 91}),\n"," Document(page_content='76 Diagnostic tests in respiratory medicine\\n5.4.1  Methods of examining \\ninflammatory cytokines\\nMeasurement of cytokines in blood, sputum and \\nBAL fluid is outside the scope of clinical work \\nand is entirely related to research in the area of \\nasthma studies.

A \\nnormal level of lung function is the goal of any \\ntreatment and follow-up. The lung function should \\nbe measured at the onset of asthma symptoms, or \\nwhen the diagnosis of asthma has been verified, \\nand at least once a year thereafter, as well as when \\nthe patient has increased asthma symptoms. With \\nmore severe asthma, a lower level of lung function \\nand a higher level of residual volume are observed. \\nLung function can be easily measured, often with \\nportable equipment in a non-invasive manner; \\nlarge series of normal predictive values exist that \\nconsider the differences between different cohorts, \\nsuch as Caucasian, Asian and African populations.\\n5.5.1  Method for measuring lung \\nfunction\\nIn terms of spirometry , the forced expiratory vol -\\nume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capac -\\nity (FVC) should regularly be measured in all \\nasthma patients from the age of 6 years or when the \\nchild is able to cooperate. In patients who cannot collaborate to perform spirometry, including FEV1 \\nand FVC, other methods need to be used. The equip -\\nment should be calibrated regularly. Each measure -\\nment consists of at least two, and often more than \\ntwo, maximal expiratory manoeuvres from the \\ntotal lung capacity to residual volume, with a varia -\\ntion of less than 5%. The highest FEV1 and FVC \\nshould be used as absolute values in the clinic and \\nused in the analyses when performing research. \\nData on pulmonary function can be expressed as a \\npercentage of predicted values (%pred), using pre -\\ndicted equations based on age, sex and height in \\nnon-smoking individuals. The ratio between FEV1 \\nand FVC can be calculated, and airway obstruc -\\ntion is normally defined by a ratio less than 70%. \\nFor the measurement of the airflow in the periph -\\neral airways, as well as obstruction of the smaller \\nairways, FEF25–75 may be performed, although \\nit does not entirely measure either the flow or the \\nobstruction of these airways. The most widely used \\nreference materials are performed by the Global \\nLung Function Initiative (GLI) Network, which has \\nbecome the largest resource for reference values for \\nroutine lung function testing ever assembled.\\nBronchodilator reversibility testing  can be per -\\nformed with inhaled beta2 agonist.

FOT and \\nIOS were described by Dubois over 50 years ago, and they permit passive measurement of the lung mechanics. In this method, sound waves are super -\\nimposed on normal tidal breathing, and the dis -\\nturbances in flow and pressure caused by external waves are used to calculate parameters describ -\\ning the resistance to airflow and reactive param -\\neters, which mostly relate to the efficient storage and return of energy by the lung. The technique requires minimal patient cooperation and can be done easily in subjects who cannot undergo spi -\\nrometry. Although the evaluation of IOS is still controversial (see Chapter 2 ), the reactance at \\n5\\xa0 Hz ( ×5) is suggested as an index of peripheral \\nairway obstruction. Importantly, IOS can differ -\\nentiate small airway obstruction from large airway obstruction, and it is more sensitive than measure -\\nment of peripheral airway disease, where FEF25–75 is performed.\\n5.5.2  A nalysing lung function\\nMeasurement of FEV1 is standard in all clini -\\ncal and research settings and should always be included at all visits to the clinic or research unit. The variability of well-performed spirometry is low, and changes of 200 mL are outside the normal variation. An FEV/VC ratio less than 70% used to detect expiratory airway obstruction can underes -\\ntimate a low level of lung function in young adults, who will often have a ratio above 80%, and overes -\\ntimate obstruction in the elderly, as ageing leads to a normal reduction in FEV\\n1. It has been suggested \\nto use a value of lower limit of normal (LLN) lung function as the predicted value, especially for the ratio, and this recommendation is not least salient in research.\\n5.6  AIRWAY HYPERRESPONSIVENESS\\nAirway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is a charac -\\nteristic finding in patients with asthma, based on excessive reactivity of the airways in patients with asthma compared with non-asthmatic subjects to different unspecific stimuli and reflecting in part a dysfunction of the airway smooth muscle. AHR is found in almost all asthma patients, although there is considerable variability in the intensity of AHR, both between and within asthma patients. AHR is associated with airway inflammation, both Th2-high and Th2-low inflammation, and asthma patients who do not possess either type \\nof inflammation (i.e. eosinophilic and non-  \\neosinophilic asthma), still possess AHR of the air -\\nway smooth muscles. These findings indicate that AHR is a general feature in asthma, independent of the profile and type of airway inflammation.\\nAHR is due to contraction of airway smooth \\nmuscle induced by either direct or indirect stimuli. Bronchospastic mediators lead to bronchocon -\\nstriction, and the sensitivity is a measure of AHR. Direct stimuli, such as methacholine, directly cause airway smooth muscle contraction. Indirect stimuli, such as exercise or osmotic stimuli, trigger mast cell release of bronchospastic mediators. Mast cells in the airway smooth muscles are increased in asthma patients compared with healthy controls. These mast cells can be located in the epithelium, submucosa and airway smooth muscles. The den -\\nsity and location of mast cells have been found to be important: In a study including healthy controls and asthma patients, mast cells were increased in asthma patients, as well as in non-asthma patients with chronic eosinophilic bronchitis without AHR. Furthermore, the location and number of the mast cells in the mucosa are important for AHR, whether indirect or direct. The response to indirect AHR has been associated with mast cells located in the epithelium, but in a steroid-naïve group of asthma patients, no differences were found between indirect and direct AHR and the presence of mast cells.\\n5.6.1   O smotic versus thermal \\nmechanism\\nThe osmotic theory of exercise-induced broncho -\\nconstriction (EIB) is based on hyperpnoea of dry air leading to airway dehydration, resulting in higher osmolarity at the airway surface. Higher osmolar -\\nity induces water movement from the surrounding cells towards the airway lumen to restore normal osmolarity. This brings shrinkage of the subepi -\\nthelial inflammatory cells, release of inflammatory mediators and development of bronchoconstric -\\ntion. This theory is called the osmotic mechanism . \\nAirway cooling provoked during hyperpnoea leads to vasoconstriction of the bronchial circulation, reactive hyperaemia with vascular leakage and ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 93}),\n"," Document(page_content='78 Diagnostic tests in respiratory medicine\\noedema, as well as transient airway bronchocon -\\nstriction, a mechanism that is called the thermal \\nmechanism .

There are advantages and disadvantages to both procedures. The tidal breathing test induces bronchoconstric -\\ntion through the inhalation of increasing concentra -\\ntions of the drug (e.g. methacholine). Furthermore, AHR can be measured using an indirect agent, of which, mannitol is most frequently used. In patients who primarily claim exercise-related symptoms, a negative methacholine test may be conducted, despite a positive exertion challenge test. The selec -\\ntion of the test requires knowledge of the popula -\\ntion to be tested, the mechanism of response of the test and whether the results will be used in the clinical or research setting. Finally, in case of FEV\\n1, \\n<60% predicted value testing is not advised. Before \\ntesting, medication must be withhold depending on which medication used ( Table 5.1 ). If medication \\nis not withhold, a positive response can be used as a diagnostic for AHR, whereas the negative response might be due to the pre-treatment regime and a new test should be scheduled.\\n5.6.2.1   DIRECT BRONCHIAL CHALLENGE \\nTESTING\\nMethacholine provocation works directly on the smooth muscles, whereas histamine acts via nervous irritant receptors and a vagal reflex. Nevertheless, they give similar results; in practical terms, there is little reason for choosing one over the other test method. Side effects of histamine, such as throat irritation, hoarseness, cough, flush -\\ning and headache at high doses, occur frequently, whereas no side effects of methacholine have been reported. Therefore, most direct tests are performed with methacholine. There is no standardised test method; there are several methods to be used when performing direct bronchial challenge testing. Furthermore, methacholine has a short storage time, lasting only 1 month after opening the bottle. A positive response of 20% reduction in FEV\\n1 (i.e. \\ncut-off value of 80% in FEV1) should be calculated \\nbefore testing to know when to stop the test.\\nDosimeter methods  can be performed with a \\nnebuliser generating the aerosols of the test solu -\\ntion, where the output per inhalation should be standardised, as well as the number of inhalations per dose. This method can either be performed with increasing doses in each container (e.g. four cans and a fixed number of inhalations per can) or a fixed dose in one container, often incredibly low, and an increasing number of inhalations. Each aerosol is inhaled through a mouthpiece, starting with a dose of isotonic saline. The response should be measured by determining the FEV\\n1 60 s after \\neach inhalation. Immediately thereafter, succes -\\nsively increasing doses of methacholine ranging from 0.06 to 7.8 μ mol should be delivered until a \\ncumulated dose of 7.8 μmol or a 20% decrease in \\nFEV\\n1 is reached. Subjects with a decrease in FEV1 \\n≥ 20% (PD20) after inhalation of methacholine of \\n7.8 μmol or less have a positive test (i.e. AHR).

Hypertonic saline (4.5%) is inhaled as an \\naerosol from a nebuliser for periods of increasing \\nduration (e.g. 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 minutes); FEV1 is \\nmeasured between each inhalation.

Therefore, \\na reduction in FEV1 of 10% is an abnormal response. \\nThis cut-off value has been used in EVH and exer -\\ncise testing, where a positive response to EVH of 10% (on 2 points) is defined as AHR, and likewise, a fall in FEV\\n1 of 10% after exercise is defined as \\nEIB. Mannitol has shown similar results, where a 10% fall in FEV\\n1 defines an abnormal response \\nthat correlates with the response to EVH, but AHR has been defined as PD\\n15 and not PD10. In contrast, \\nin the clinical setting, a response of 10–14% after inhalation of mannitol can be used as some support for the diagnosis of asthma, whereas this is not pos -\\nsible in research and never in elite athletes (needing a dispensation called a TUE), where a 15% fall in FEV\\n1 after inhalation of 635 mg or less is needed \\nfor the diagnosis of asthma (i.e. PD15 ≤ 635 mg). \\nTraditionally, methacholine, histamine and AMP provocation use a reduction in FEV\\n1 of 20%, which \\nhas never been questioned, probably due to a lack of standardisation of the challenge equipment. Furthermore, in the case of other lung function measurements, such as FOT/IOS, FEF25–75 and sGaw or Raw, a reduction of 40% (PD\\n40/PC40) is \\nneeded to document an abnormal variation in the airflow due to the large variability of lung function equipment.\\nIn principle, all types of physical exertion test -\\ning (exercise and EVH) can be used to examine for exertional triggered asthma. There are several stress-testing protocols, with the criterion for a sufficiently performed test being that the person exerts for a maximum of 6–8 minutes. Heart rate is the most useful measure of labour inten -\\nsity, although the ventilation rate is more closely correlated to the bronchoconstrictor stimulus. A positive response is defined as a decrease in FEV\\n1 \\nfrom the 10% point of departure. Furthermore, patients with a history of EIA will have a nega -\\ntive test in 25% of cases, while the others will be positive.\\nFor the diagnosis of asthma, when analysing the \\ndifferent challenge tests, some degree of overlap between the test results exists, and a combination of tests (PEF variation, reversibility, methacho -\\nline, mannitol) performed on all patients on dif -\\nferent days has revealed a diagnostic value as high as 82%, whereas 18% of patients with asthma diagnosed by a clinician with asthma knowl -\\nedge have four negative asthma challenge tests. In contrast, this research also showed that, when increasing the number of tests for the diagnosis of asthma, the specificity became lower, indicat -\\ning a risk of an increasing number of false-  po sitive \\nresults ( Table 5.2 ). Direct tests have a lower speci -\\nficity and a relatively higher sensitivity compared with indirect tests. Like the other indirect tests, the AMP test has a high specificity, but an even lower sensitivity compared with the methacho -\\nline test, although the sensitivity is probably bet -\\nter than it is for the physiological indirect tests. Incidentally, exertion testing is generally less sensitive than methacholine provocation is, but it is more specific, since a positive test is only seen in asthma patients; therefore, an exertion test is \\nTable 5.2  Different bronchial challenge tests and sensitivity, specificity and association with asthma, \\ninflammation and treatment response\\nAgent Sensitivity SpecificityAssociation \\nwith asthma severityAssociation with inflammatory cellsAssociation with treatment response\\nMethacholine High Moderate Slight Slight Slight\\nHistamine High Moderate Slight Slight ?\\n4.5% Saline Moderate High Good Good ?\\nMannitol Moderate High Good Good Good\\nExercise test Low High Moderate Moderate ?\\nEVH Moderate High High Good ?\\nAMP Moderate High Good Good ?\\nNote:  This table is based on individual findings in scientific papers, but is without direct scientific documentation. \\nThose with ‘?’ have no scientific support.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 97}),\n"," Document(page_content='82 Diagnostic tests in respiratory medicine\\nbetter at verifying the diagnosis, whereas a sensi -\\ntive test, such as methacholine AHR, when nega -\\ntive, can be used to rule-out asthma. The exercise \\ntest is more specific than the methacholine test is, \\nbut it is somewhat less sensitive; however, unlike \\nin the methacholine test, dose–response curves are \\nnot obtained by the exertion test, providing either \\na positive or negative result without modulation \\nof response severity. This can make the effort test \\ndifficult because the response is unpredictable. \\nPatients with a positive response to an indirect \\ntest (e.g. mannitol) are more likely to have asthma, \\nand they also need treatment with inhaled steroid, \\nwhereas a positive response to a direct agent can \\nhappen in non-asthmatic individuals, with a PPV \\nof 35%; in contrast, the PNV of bronchial chal -\\nlenge testing has been found to be 99%. Bronchial \\nchallenge testing cannot be used as screening (low \\nPPV), but it is highly suitable for ruling out asthma \\n(high PNV). In terms of the correlation with airway \\ninflammation , positive exertion and mannitol tests \\nindicate an increased likelihood of eosinophilic \\nairway inflammation occurring more frequently in \\nasthma patients with EIB than in asthma patients \\nwithout exertion symptoms.\\nConcerning time and resource consumption , \\ntesting takes approximately 30 minutes in total, \\nalthough the tidal breathing direct challenge test -\\ning takes longer than any of the others. The test \\nneeding the least equipment is the mannitol test, \\nwhich needs a spirometer and Mannitol Kit. EVH \\nand exercise testing are more demanding and \\ncostly due to the need for expensive equipment.\\n5.7 FITNESS IN ASTHMA\\nMost asthma patients suffer from EIA when they \\nexercise. Pre-treatment with anti-asthmatic therapy \\nor interval training as a warmup has been recom -\\nmended. However, exercise has also been suggested \\nas a non-pharmacological treatment for asthma. \\nThe treatment guidelines from the Global Initiative \\nfor Asthma (GINA) recommend that physicians \\nencourage patients to engage in physical exercise \\nbecause of its well-known health benefits. However, \\nthe extent to which exercise improves asthma-\\nrelated outcomes in adult patients, such as asthma \\ncontrol, lung function and airway inflammation, \\nis not fully understood. Previous meta-analyses \\ninvestigating exercise interventions in asthma have \\nincluded studies with children and adolescents or have focused on bronchial hyperreactivity, but \\nstudies of adult patients with asthma are limited. \\nFor some time, it was uncertain whether it was pos -\\nsible to perform endurance training in patients with \\nasthma, but it has recently been documented that \\nthis is safe. Furthermore, elite athletes who perform \\nendurance sports are more likely to develop asthma \\nthan those who play team sports. The most popu -\\nlar clinical exercise tests, in order of increasing \\ncomplexity are: (1) stair climbing, (2) the 6-minute \\nwalking test (6MWT), (3) shuttle-walking test, \\n(4) detection of EIA and (5) cardiopulmonary exer -\\ncise testing (oxygen uptake).\\n5.7.1 Methods of fitness scoring\\n5.7.1.1  THE 6-MINUTE WALKING \\nTEST (6MWT)\\nThe 6MWT is a practical, simple test; it requires a \\n30-m hallway but no exercise equipment or techni -\\ncal training. The test measures the distance that a \\npatient can walk on a flat surface for a period of \\n6\\xa0 minutes while walking as quickly as possible. \\nThis test examines the unified (rather than individ -\\nual) response from all systems involved in exercise \\nand training, such as the lungs, heart, circulation, \\nblood, neuromuscular units and muscle metabo -\\nlism. The self-paced test only assesses the submaxi -\\nmal level of functional capacity; most patients do \\nnot achieve maximal exercise capacity during tests \\nif they choose the speed themselves. The choice \\nbetween maximal and sub-maximal tests depends \\non whether the focus is on the speed of everyday \\nactivities or the maximum speed achievable.\\nThe purpose of the 6MWT is a measurement of \\nthe response to medical or physical interventions \\nin patients with respiratory illness. The 6MWT can \\nalso be used as a measurement of baseline fitness \\nlevel. 6MWT measure exercise-induced shortness \\nof breath, but it does not measure oxygen uptake; \\nthe maximal oxygen consumption test (VO2max) \\ndoes this. Therefore, these two tests are comple -\\nmentary and supplement each other.\\n5.7.1.2  SHUTTLE-WALKING TEST\\nThe shuttle-walking test (SWT) is like the 6MWT, \\nbut, in this test, an audio signal from a tape cas -\\nsette directs the patient’s pace as they walk back \\nand forth on a 10-m course. The walking speed is \\nincreased everyone minute, and the test ends when ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 98}),\n"," Document(page_content='5.8 Cough reflex sensitivity 83\\nthe patient cannot reach the turnaround point \\nwithin the time limit. This test correlates better \\nwith oxygen uptake than the 6MWT does. The dis -\\nadvantages are that it is less validated and may be \\nmore likely to result in cardiovascular problems.\\n5.7.1.3 OXYGEN UPTAKE\\nAfter a 10-minute warm-up on the treadmill, to \\ntest oxygen uptake, participants perform a maxi -\\nmal run. The constant speed is set individually \\nso that all subjects finish in 4–6 minutes (14–16 \\nkm h−1). After 2 minutes, the treadmill incline is \\nadjusted to 2%; it is then increased by a further 2% \\nevery 90 s until exhaustion. Respiratory variables \\nare measured continuously (AMIS 2001 automated \\nmetabolic cart, INNOVISION, Odense, Denmark) \\nand averaged for each 15-s period, and the mean \\nof the three highest VO2 15-s values is recorded as \\nthe maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). The main \\nobjective of ergometric stress testing, aside from \\ndiagnostic evaluation of clinical manifestations \\n(dyspnea, dizziness, exhaustion, pain, etc.), is to \\nmeasure the parameters relating to exercise physi -\\nology for the assessment of performance capac -\\nity. The main parameters to be measured and \\nmonitored include the performance achieved (in \\nwatts or km/h), heart rate (HR), ECG, arterial \\nblood pressure (BP), lactate concentration (Lac), \\nthe spiro-ergometric parameters oxygen uptake \\n(VO2), carbon dioxide release (VCO2), respiratory \\nquotient (RQ = VO2/VCO2), respiratory rate (RR), \\nrespiratory minute volume (VE) and respiratory \\nequivalent (RE = VE/VO2). Cardiovascular fitness \\ncan be measured as peak oxygen uptake (absolute \\nand relative VO2peak) or peak power output (Wpeak). \\nWhen tested according to the guidelines, these \\nmeasures show few variations and can be used to \\nevaluate change over time, such as from baseline \\nto follow-up. In asthmatic people, testing might be \\ndone after inhalation of bronchodilator, although \\neffect of this is questioned.\\nHR is measured continuously using an HR \\nmonitor (Polar Sport Tester •, Polar Electro OY, \\nKempele, Finland). To ensure that a true VO2max is \\nattained, at least two of the following three criteria \\nmust be met: VO2 plateau is reached, the highest \\nheart rate (fc) is within ± 5 beats min−1 of the age-\\nadjusted maximum, or VCO2/VO2 > 1.0. Maximal \\noxygen uptake is expressed per kilogramme of \\nbody mass raised to the power of two-thirds per \\nminute (mL O2*(kg2/3)−1*min−1).The indications and goals for cardiopulmonary \\nexercise testing in asthma include:\\n1. Assessing unexplained shortness of breath\\n2. Evaluating disease severity\\n3. Establishing a baseline level of fitness \\nbefore prescribing exercise for pulmonary \\nrehabilitation\\n4. Identifying gas exchange abnormalities \\n(e.g. ABPA)\\n5. Objectively evaluating exercise capacity\\n5.7.2 Analysis of fitness score\\nThe level of a patient’s shortness of breath can be \\ndescribed with a specific questionnaire, but mea -\\nsurements of exercise-induced shortness of breath \\nand fitness levels should be more valid. Measuring \\nfitness levels in patients with asthma is important \\nwhen prescribing exercise as non-pharmacological \\ntreatment. Oxygen uptake testing or 6MWT are \\nequally adequate for monitoring physical capacity, \\nalthough no side-by-side test has been performed.\\n5.8 COUGH REFLEX SENSITIVITY\\nThe three most common causes of chronic cough \\nare upper airway cough syndrome, asthma \\nand GERD, but there are often multiple causes. \\nFurthermore, acute viral cough is the costliest \\nhealthcare problem. Acute cough is defined as \\nmore than 3 weeks of symptoms; subacute is indi -\\ncated by 3–8 weeks of symptoms and longer than \\n8 weeks is defined as a chronic cough. Chronic \\ncough can be triggered and arise anywhere in the \\nbronchial tree.\\nCoughing is a normal physiological process; it \\nis a protective reflex that clears debris and secre -\\ntions from the airways. The cough reflex consists \\nof an afferent sensory limb and the central process -\\ning centre, which is an efferent limb. The afferent \\nnerves involved are the vagal nerve and its sensory \\nbranches. These sensory nerves are found from \\nthe pharynx to the terminal bronchioles; most are \\nin the larynx, carina and bifurcation of the larger \\nbronchi. The message that irritants or other reasons \\nto cough are in the bronchial system is mediated to \\nthe central process centre, called the nucleus tract \\nsolitarius (NTS); it is located in the cough centre \\nin the medulla brainstem. The efferent pathways \\nare then mediated back to the respiratory tract ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 99}),\n"," Document(page_content='84 Diagnostic tests in respiratory medicine\\nthrough other branches of the vagal nerve. This \\ncauses activity in the respiratory muscles, the laryngeal area and the bronchial smooth muscles.\\nCough initiates with a deep inspiration that \\nfills the thoracic cavity with air. The external cos -\\ntal muscles are stimulated, the diaphragm flattens and the glottic area opens to let the air in. Next, the vocal cords are closed, creating pressure in the tho -\\nracic cavity. A high-speed expiration is stimulated by the contraction of the abdominal wall muscles, the diaphragm returns to a convex shape, the inter -\\nnal costal muscles contract and, finally, the glottic area opens. Since the higher cortical centres influ -\\nence the cough centre, it is possible to voluntarily produce or suppress a cough. A complex reflex arc\\xa0is stimulated for each cough ( Table 5.3 ).\\nCoughing can be voluntary or involuntary, and \\nit can be systematically evaluated to exclude the most common causes, such as asthma (50%), upper airway disorders, GERD and, less frequently, eosinophilic bronchitis or pharmacological side effects. Cough severity can be evaluated by sev -\\neral different tools, including the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ).\\nMany types of sensory receptors respond to \\nmechanical,\\xa0 inflammatory, thermal and chemi -\\ncal stimuli. They are connected to the vagal affer -\\nent nerves. Recently, it has been demonstrated that cough reflex sensitivity, though transiently enhanced during acute upper-airway infection, remains stable during the first week of illness. Underlying causes of chronic cough in many patients are hypersensitivity of the afferent sensory neurons in the mucosal lin -\\ning of the airway and overexpressed C-fibre recep -\\ntors. There is evidence that hypersensitisation in the central nervous system may contribute to chronic cough as well. This overreaction results in coughing due to a variety of stimuli.\\n5.8.1   Methods of cough \\nmeasurement\\nLCQ is a validated cough-related health status questionnaire designed for patients with chronic cough. It consists of 19 questions, and scores can range from 19 (one point per question) to 63 points; low values indicate severe disease.\\nCapsaicin cough challenge testing has also \\nbecome an important tool in clinical research. It allows accurate measurement of the effect of a phar -\\nmacological intervention on the sensitivity of the cough reflex. Capsaicin is a single breath provo -\\ncation with a dosimeter that induces a volume of 0.0016 mL per breath. Without the nose clip, subjects inhale three single vital capacity breaths; capsaicin is ejected on the fourth inhalation. Doubling doses are delivered at 1-minute intervals, and the capsa -\\nicin concentration that produces 2 (C2), 5 (C5) or 10 or more (C10) coughs during the 1-minute interval between each inhalation is noted. A value of 1000 \\nμmol/L capsaicin is assigned if C2, C5 and/or C10 \\nvalues are greater than 500 μmol/L. FEV1 should be \\nmeasured before and after each inhalation.\\n5.8.2  Analysis of cough score\\nThe standard end point of capsaicin cough chal -\\nlenge testing is the concentration of capsaicin that induces five or more coughs (C\\n5). In healthy volun -\\nteers, this end point is highly reproducible, whether on the same day, within a couple of weeks or after months or even years. Furthermore, in some stud -\\nies, capsaicin provocation has been used at home for desensitisation, together with behavioural cough suppression therapy, to treat chronic cough. In our study, patients with stable asthma exhibited exaggerated capsaicin-provoked cough responses consistent with neuronal dysfunction. Nonatopic asthmatic patients had the highest cough responses, suggesting that this mechanism might be most important in type-2-low asthma phenotypes.Table 5.3  Neural mechanisms of coughing\\nCerebral cortex\\nVoluntary coughVoluntary cough suppressionBrainstem (medulla oblongata)Integrative inputsInteraction with breathingMotor outputSensory input, larynx and lower airwayRapidly adapting receptorsA-delta nociceptorsC-fibre receptorsMotor responsesRespiratory musclesLaryngeal musclesUpper airway musclesBronchial muscles\\nSource:  Morice (2004), with copyright acceptance.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n"," Document(page_content='5.8 Cough reflex sensitivity 85\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\nBacker V, et al.

It should identify quickly patients with moderate and severe asthma who are better man -\\naged in secondary care. The approach needs to offer patients appropriately targeted effective ther -\\napy at an early stage and avoid medication-related side effects.\\nThe diagnosis of asthma is usually based on \\nthe recognition of a typical pattern of symptoms in a patient with appropriate risk factors ( Figure \\n7.1). Two or more of the features listed in Table 7.1  \\nwould increase the probability of asthma to the point where a trial of treatment would be reason -\\nable. Additional tests to demonstrate variable air -\\nflow obstruction may help to support a diagnosis (bronchial provocation test) but the most acces -\\nsible of these in primary care (monitoring of peak expiratory flow, spirometry and reversibility) are insensitive and are prone to measurement error; they are, therefore, not useful for excluding a diag -\\nnosis. We suggest that further testing is reserved for patients who do not respond to an initial trial of treatment. Most people with mild and moderate asthma will respond to inhaled corticosteroids and it is now clear that applying ICS using a symptom-based approach with as needed low-dose ICS/rapid onset LABA, or ICS/short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA), is an effective way of doing this. Moreover, the beneficial effect of as needed low-dose ICS/rapid onset LABA on exacerbations occurs in patients with both T2 high and T2 low forms of asthma, making it the most obvious starting point in a patient with suspected or confirmed asthma. This is because the two dominant airway traits are targeted in a single inhaler, i.e. the ICS component targets T2 inflammation whereas the B2-agonist targets airflow obstruction.\\nOnce anti-inflammatory reliever therapy is estab -\\nlished as the default reliever option, the debate then becomes how do we define success of this approach; which patients should be assessed and considered for regular treatment and what should that regular treatment look like?\\n7.1.1  The goals of initial therapy \\nwith ICS/LABA\\nWe suggest that patients with controlled symp -\\ntoms (i.e. ACQ <1), normal spirometry, no history \\nor risk factors for exacerbations (i.e. normal FeNO and blood eosinophils, see figure) who are using <2 puffs of ICS/rapid onset beta agonist per week \\ndo not need further assessment. If patients do not meet any of these criteria, there are several possi -\\nbilities that need considering, the wrong diagnosis, relatively refractory disease or non-adherence. In order to delineate between these three, more infor -\\nmation on disease pathophysiology and adherence is needed. This can effectively and efficiently be achieved by using a treatable traits approach.\\nFirstly,  the airway trait of type-2 inflammation \\nis measured using biomarkers such as the blood eosinophil count and FeNO. Both of these markers have been consistently linked to an increased risk of exacerbation with a combined eosinophil/FeNO measure also associated with a doubling preva -\\nlence of uncontrolled asthma. Treatment that tar -\\ngets type-2 inflammation is associated with fewer asthma exacerbations. FeNO can also be used to provide information on adherence which can be ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 111}),\n"," Document(page_content='96 Evaluation of the asthmas\\nused to delineate refractory patients from those \\nwho are non-adherent to corticosteroid therapy. Both markers are relatively easy to perform, pro -\\nvide relatively rapid information and add both pre -\\ndictive and prognostic value. This is also an obvious entry point for the use of novel digital inhalers and connected inhaler systems, which when aligned with biomarker profiling (FeNO and blood eosino -\\nphil count) will aid decision making in the clinic prior to treatment escalation. This approach will facilitate the identification of patients who would achieve a good response with monitored adherence with inhaled treatment but also identifies patients who despite adequate treatment with high-dose ICS treatment are likely to have persisting type-2 inflammation and will probably require escalation to novel biologic therapies.\\nSecondly , spirometry (and if appropriate) \\nreversibility should follow to inform prognosis and exclude other diagnoses. Poor lung function is associated with a worse outcome and may prompt other investigations such as CT or full lung func -\\ntion tests leading to consideration of other dis -\\neases including bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis. Spirometry can also help identify whether symp -\\ntoms are in keeping with physiological limitation.

Clinical trials show that physiotherapy-led breath retraining interventions successfully improve symptoms and health-related quality of life in this situation. Taken together the combination of a type-2 inflamma -\\ntory biomarker profile and spirometric measure -\\nment will allow the treating clinician to identify the dominante airway traits that are present and to decide between increasing the dose of ICS and adding additional bronchodilators. It will also give an indication of adherence, prognosis and poten -\\ntial need for novel monoclonal asthma therapies.\\nThere are other advantages to the overall strategy \\nof delineating between a symptom-based manage -\\nment plan for most patients and a treatable-trait-driven plan for those still uncontrolled. Firstly, moving away from the step therapy approach which uses a ‘one size fits all’ approach will address the issue of concomitant over and under diagno -\\nsis. It is recognised that an initial approach of ICS/LABA or ICS/SABA may result in overtreatment of some patients with very mild asthma, but this cost may be outweighed by the reduction in under treatment in those who rely on SABA for symptom control. Alternatively, a treatable traits approach where testing for T2 inflammation is used to select patients for ICS therapy can be used. This approach is analogous to a population-based approach used in cardiology or diabetes where primary and sec -\\nondary prophylaxes with aspirin or statins are accepted to have potential adverse effects which are outweighed by putative benefits ( Figure 7.1 ).\\nA population symptom-driven management \\nplan also removes the need to perform biomarker assessment in many low risk, low yield patients, limiting more expensive and involved tests to those with poor symptom control despite (apparent) ICS therapy. This approach is likely to be more effec -\\ntive than the current one size fits all policy and cre -\\nates a natural cut point for referral from primary to secondary care with the input of more specialised biomarker assessments and inhaler monitoring technologies. It also explicitly excludes the use of a single SABA as therapy which has consistently been linked to poor outcomes. This is one of the impor -\\ntant discoveries in the current decades, as SABA has been the first drug to use not least in primary care.\\nThere are potential downsides to stratifying \\nbased on initial treatment response; this policy has not been tested in a large population of patients Table 7.1  Clinical features that increase or \\ndecrease the probability of asthma\\nA.

However, scientific evaluations \\nhave shown that only 13 out of 68 disease-specific \\nquestionnaires are developed to warrant full-quality \\nappraisal. In a clinical setting, but also in research, the \\nAsthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), the GINA \\nsymptoms score and the Asthma Control Test (ACT) \\nare employed to focus on adult asthma control. These \\ntools mainly address the symptoms and functional \\nstatus of these patients rather than their personal \\nperceptions of how asthma impacts their quality of \\nlife. In recent years, specific questionnaires directed \\ntoward severe asthma have been developed – the \\nSevere Asthma Questionnaire (SAQ) and the Global \\nSAQ score, which also include extrapulmonary symptoms (SAQ-Global). Furthermore, no current \\nquestionnaire exists covering global airways (both \\nupper and lower airways), which is highly needed in \\nclinical and research setting to simultaneously assess \\nthe impact of asthma and rhinitis in those with \\ncoexisting diseases. High-quality PROMs concern -\\ning perception of the disease are the Asthma Quality \\nof Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and its derivative, \\ndiminished version, the Mini AQLQ, which can be \\nused in both clinical and research settings. The St \\nGeorge’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) also \\nperforms well in its psychometric properties and is \\nmainly used for research. The SGRQ can be used in \\nasthma, as well as in COPD.\\nPROs can provide critical information about \\ndisease control, disease burden and treatment \\neffectiveness when combined with clinical mea -\\nsures of asthma severity. In the following sections, \\nseveral questionnaires will be discussed: first those \\ndirected toward asthma control, then those consid -\\nering quality of life. Achieving asthma control is the \\nfocus of all recently developed asthma treatment \\nguidelines. Overall asthma control consists of two \\ndomains. The first is to achieve day-to-day asthma \\ncontrol over a period of 1 or 2 weeks – indicated by \\nthe absence of asthma symptoms, minimal reliever \\nuse if any, normal activity levels and lung func -\\ntion values close to normal. The second domain \\nconcerns minimising the risk of asthma exacer -\\nbations, preventing accelerated decline in lung \\n function and treating patients without subjecting \\nthem to the side effects of asthma medications. \\nAsthma control is different from asthma severity. \\nIn the same group, there may be moderate uncon -\\ntrolled asthma and severe well-controlled asthma, \\nas severity is often assessed by the level of treat -\\nment required to control the disease – e.g. GINA \\nSteps 1 to 5. Asthma control may be useful as a \\nclinical vital sign for asthma patients. Ultimately, \\nhowever, no measure may be better than any other \\nmeasure, and the optimal measure may depend on \\nthe intended use of the scale.\\n7.2.1  Asthma Control \\nQuestionnaire (ACQ)\\nIntroduction:  Asthma control is the goal of asthma \\nmanagement and assessing asthma control is the \\nfirst step in patient care.

These simplified versions (ACQ-5 and ACQ-6) have been validated and each has been found to be satisfactory. The ACQ is the most widely used standardised measure of asthma control in clinical trials, investigator initiated, research and clinical settings. Of the validated asthma control measures available in the literature, only the ACQ fulfils all measurement characteristics, including validity, responsiveness, stability, internal consistency and interpretability (minimum important difference of 0.5 and threshold of poor control). The ACQ also aligns well with other standardised asthma control measures, including the ACT and the GINA symp -\\ntoms score.\\nThe mean score of the seven, six or five ACQ \\nitems can be computed ranging from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of uncon -\\ntrolled asthma. A mean score ≤0.75 is classified as \\n‘well controlled’, ≥1.5 as ‘uncontrolled’ and between \\nthese two cut-off points as ‘somewhat controlled’.\\nWhen comparing different studies using ACQ-5 \\nas the gold standard, examination of patients with well-controlled asthma (score of ≤0.75) showed \\na negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.81, mean -\\ning that, if a patient achieves an ACQ-5 score of 0.75, there is only a 19% probability that his or her asthma is not well-controlled. Likewise, for patients \\nwith asthma that is not well-controlled and who present a score of 1.50, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.84 has been found, meaning that, if a patient achieves a high ACQ-5 score of 1.50, there is only a 16% probability that his or her asthma is \\nwell-controlled, despite the high score.\\nThe Minimal Important Difference (MID) of \\nthe ACQ has been formally determined to be 0.5 by using anchor-based approaches in patients studied over time, with an SD of 0.997.2.2   G INA- and GOAL-related \\ncontrol\\nGINA-defined asthma control: According to the frequency of clinical characteristics – including daytime symptoms, limitation of activity, noctur -\\nnal symptoms/awakening, need for reliever/rescue treatment and lung function (PEF or FEV\\n1) – asthma \\npatients are classified as controlled (C), partially controlled (P) or uncontrolled (U). Afterwards, treatment is selected, and management of the treat -\\nment intervention is based on the level of asthma control. Similarly, patients with asthma may be evaluated via the Gaining Optimal Asthma Control (GOAL) system and defined as total control (TC), well-controlled (WC) or uncontrolled (UC) ( Figure  \\n7.2). The main differences between these two mea -\\nsures are the C (GINA) and TC (GOAL) descriptors (in which slightly more symptoms and heightened rescue beta2 agonist use are permitted by GINA, and not by GOAL) and in the P (GINA) and WC (GOAL) descriptors (in which, again, GINA is less stringent). These differences, however, have not resulted in any differences in patient diagnoses of C/TC asthma or P/WC asthma, as reflected by a kappa value of 0.96 for GINA’s C compared to GOAL’s TC and a kappa value of 0.80 for GINA’s U compared with GOAL’s UC (kappa values exceed -\\ning 0.8 indicate almost perfect agreement). A simi -\\nlar pattern exists between the ACQ-5 and GINA and between the ACQ-5 and GOAL.\\n7.2.3  A sthma Control Test\\nThe Asthma Control Test (ACT) has been devel -\\noped by asthma experts as an easy-to-use test, both in clinical and research settings. The ACT assesses the frequency of shortness of breath, night-time/early awakenings, rescue medication use, overall asthma control and loss of productivity.\\nThe ACT provides a numerical score to assess \\nasthma control. The ACT questionnaire is a 5-item, patient-administered tool, including a 5-point rating scale. In scoring the ACT survey, responses for each of the 5 items are summed to yield a total score ranging from 5 (poor asthma control) to 25 (complete asthma control). A score of ≥20 indicates ‘well-controlled’ asthma, while a \\nscore ≤19 indicates asthma that is ‘not well con -\\ntrolled’. There is a negative relationship between ACT points and the risk of asthma exacerbation,  ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 115}),\n"," Document(page_content='100 Evaluation of the asthmas\\nwith the highest risk at an ACT of five and the low -\\nest at an ACT of 25, with almost no change between \\nthe 20–25 points ( Figure 7.3 ). The ACT score pro -\\nvides patients and their healthcare professionals with a useful measure for helping to determine the level of treatment required. It has been concluded that an ACT score of ≤ 19 predicts control levels of P or U asthma, as defined by GINA. The sensitivity of the ACT, with a cut-off of 19 points, was 71.3. The predictive value of a positive test (PPV) was 72.6 and of a negative test (PVN) was 69.3. The specificity was 70.8, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.710.

Comprehensive asthma evaluation includes \\nmeasurements of allergy, lung function, airway \\nhyperresponsiveness and symptoms, which gives \\nuseful information about airway status, severity \\nand disease control but provides little information \\nabout the functional impairments that are impor -\\ntant in a patient’s everyday life. Thus, measuring \\nHRQL – and, even better, disease-specific HRQL – \\nmay illustrate the benefits of treatment strategies \\nnot revealed by objective monitoring. Knowledge \\nof the HRQL score can complement clinical and \\nphysiological assessments of treatment outcomes. \\nFor asthma, one of the most often used disease-\\nspecific HRQL measurements is the AQLQ, which \\nhas been developed to measure problems related to \\ndaily life. One feature of the original AQLQ score \\nis that 5 of its 11 activity questions are selected by \\nthe patients themselves. This can enhance the con -\\ntent validity, accommodate cultural differences and \\nimprove the questionnaire’s relevance in clinical \\npractice. On the other hand, follow-up measure -\\nments in both clinical and research settings make \\nthis feature difficult due to seasonal variation. For \\nexample, if a patient selected ‘mow the grass’ as one \\nof his or her chosen items, and if the next session \\nhappens in Winter, the ‘mow the grass’ issue is no \\nlonger applicable, as it could be snowing by this \\ntime of the year. This makes comparison difficult – \\neven impossible. Therefore, a standardised version \\nhas been developed [the AQLQ(S)] to include five \\ngeneric activity questions and it is generally the \\nmeasure used. The AQLQ(S) also presents a better \\ncorrelation with clinical outcomes, though the cor -\\nrelation between the AQLQ and the AQLQ(S) is as \\nclose as 0.95.The AQLQ(S) presents 32 items, with four \\ndomain scores, including questions of: (1) symp -\\ntoms, 12 questions; (2) activities, 11 questions; \\n(3) emotional function, five questions and (4) envi -\\nronmental exposure, four questions. However, a \\nsmaller HRQL measure with a similar focus has \\nbeen developed. This new questionnaire is based \\non the former AQLQ and is called the Mini AQLQ \\n(Mini AQLQ); it is a 15-item, self-administered \\nquestionnaire and includes the same four domains. \\nBoth the AQLQ and the Mini AQLQ use a score \\nof 7 for no impairment and of 1 for maximum \\nimpairment. The scoring is calculated based on the \\npatients’ experiences over the previous 2 weeks. \\nThe overall score (out of 32 or 15 questions) should \\nbe summed and then divided by the number of \\nquestions answered – either for each domain and \\nfor the entire score. The higher the score, the better \\nthe quality of life. Absolute differences of approxi -\\nmately 1.0 represent a moderate change, and differ -\\nences greater than 1.5 represent large changes. The \\nAQLQ(S) and the Mini-AQLQ have been trans -\\nlated into many languages and have become two \\nof the most widely used asthma-specific quality of \\nlife instruments in research and clinical practice. \\nBoth paper and electronic versions are available, \\nwith an intraclass correlation coefficient between \\nthe two media of 0.92 for the AQLQ and of 0.95 \\nfor the Mini-AQLQ. For the four domains (symp -\\ntoms, activities, emotional function and environ -\\nmental stimuli) these correlation coefficients are \\n0.94, 0.89, 0.90 and 0.91, respectively. For overall \\nasthma-specific quality of life and for all indi -\\nvidual domains (symptoms, activities, emotional \\nfunction and environmental stimuli), the MID \\nquality of life score is 0.5, with an SD of 0.88.\\n7.2.5  St George’s Respiratory \\nQuestionnaire\\nAlthough the SGRQ was initially developed to \\nevaluate psychometric health in asthma, limited \\ndata are available on the quantitative validity of \\nthe SGRQ in the asthma population. The SGRQ \\nis currently used in patients with COPD, but it \\nmay be a valuable PROM for evaluation of severe \\nasthma.\\nThe SGRQ is a self-administered questionnaire, \\nwhich was developed to measure health status in \\npatients with diseases of chronic airflow limita -\\ntion. It contains 50 items, and scores are calculated ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 117}),\n"," Document(page_content='102 Evaluation of the asthmas\\nfor a total score of respiratory health status across \\nthree domains: symptoms (frequency and sever -\\nity of respiratory symptoms), activity (activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness) and impacts (social functioning and psychological dis -\\nturbances due to airway disease). Total and indi -\\nvidual domain scores are calculated with all items weighted and are expressed as a percentage; higher scores indicate a worse state. The reliability of the SGRQ is lower than that in other PROMs, such as the ACQ, as the clinical rating is part of the ques -\\ntionnaire; this is especially true in the domain con -\\ncerning symptoms, although the overall reliability is satisfactory.\\nThe mean differences (SD) in the SGRQ from \\nstudies including severe asthma patients have been found to be −6.3 (1.18) for the total domain, −11.4 (1.77) for symptoms, −3.5 (1.59) for activities and −6.57 (1.21) for impact. Most of these values are above the standard MID value of −4 units. calcu -\\nlated in patients with chronic airflow limitation, regardless of assessment methods.\\n7.2.6   Severe Asthma Questionnaire \\nand SAQ-Global\\nHRQL is determined via examining symptoms, personality, opportunities and choices. Patients with severe asthma have some very specific com -\\nplaints, which are related to their pulmonary symptoms and to their extrapulmonary symp -\\ntoms, which may have various causes ranging from pharmaceutical treatments to comorbidities (e.g. chronic rhinosinusitis [CRS], sleep problems, obesity etc.). These extrapulmonary symptoms are seldom included in the asthma-specific ques -\\ntionnaires used in clinical and research setting. Therefore, the SAQ has been developed for patients with severe asthma, and it is a 16-item measure, with response options on a 7-point scale (score between 1 and 7). Another, SAQ-Global scale has also been designed to measure overall quality of life on a single scale, with a 100-point score. High scores on both tests indicate good asthma control and quality of life.\\nThe mean SAQ score in patients with severe \\nasthma has been measured as 3.96 (CI 95% 3.64–4.27); this group also has an ACT score of 14.02 (CI 95% 12.76–15.28), indicating uncontrolled asthma (ACT score ≤ 19), and had an OR of 3 for an asthma \\nexacerbation. The same group of uncontrolled severe asthma patients has shown a low level of global quality of life, with an SAQ-Global score of 54.69 (CI 95% 50.00–59.38). Patients taking bio -\\nlogic drugs generally score higher (i.e. better) than those not receiving biologic drugs, which is even more pronounced when patients are treated with daily doses of prednisolone.\\nIn a recent study of asthma patients with mod -\\nerate to severe asthma severity, different ques -\\ntionnaires have been examined. A correlation coefficient above 0.60 convergence between the different questionnaires has been found ( Table 7.2 ); \\nhowever, there is no correlation between objective measurements, like obesity and lung function, and the various questionnaires used in patients with severe asthma.\\n7.2.7  Cough questionnaires\\nThe Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), Cough-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (CQLQ) and the Cough Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) can be used in chronic cough. HRQL is worse in patients with chronic cough compared to healthy control sub -\\njects, but also compared to patients who suffer from other respiratory diseases. Studies have reported a positive, weak relationship between HRQL and cough frequency in patients with chronic coughs, suggesting that cough intensity may be an impor -\\ntant determinant of global cough severity. A pro -\\nportion of patients with severe asthma have a significant degree of cough-related morbidity, named refractive chronic cough, which appears independently of eosinophilic airway inflamma -\\ntion and is not captured fully by existing asthma patient-reported outcome instruments. Cough fre -\\nquency, importance and intensity can be measured with the LCQ, CQLQ and VAS.\\nThe LCQ is a 19-point questionnaire capturing \\nthree domains, with 1 point per question: physi -\\ncal, 8 items; psychological, 7 items and social, 4 items. Each item has a score ranging from 1 to 7. Item scores for each domain are summed and divided by the total number of items for the domain. The total LCQ is the sum of the three-domain scores. The minimum and maximum achievable LCQ total scores range between 3 and 21. In patients with non-COPD chronic cough, the LCQ score has been found to be 5.8, 5.4 and 6.3 for each domain – with a total score of 17.2 (15–19).

All patients can rate cough severity and \\nintensity on a cough VAS (0–100 mm), for which \\nthe higher number, the more troublesome the \\ncough. In cough patients, the VAS score is often \\ngreater than 6, in patients complaining of chronic \\ncough. The CQLQ is a 28-item paper-and-pencil \\ntest tool. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert-\\ntype scale (1, strongly disagree; 2, disagree; 3, \\nagree; 4, strongly agree). The lowest possible total \\nscore, indicating no adverse effects of cough on \\nquality of life, is 28, and the highest possible total \\nscore is 112.

VCD sever -\\nity can be seen via laryngoscopy, either by provo -\\ncation with irritants or by exercise with closure of \\nthe laryngeal area. Moreover, measures of inspi -\\nratory obstruction, when measuring lung func -\\ntion, are diagnostic but are not always present. \\nAmong the most suitable questionnaires for iden -\\ntifying laryngeal hypersensitivity is the Newcastle \\nLaryngeal Hypersensitivity Questionnaire (LHQ). \\nThe LHQ is a 14-item, self-administered question -\\nnaire, using a 7-point ordinal scale, which assesses \\nthree domains: obstruction, pain/thermal and \\nthroat tickle. A cut-off for normal function is 17, \\nwith lower scores indicating increased laryngeal \\ndysfunction.The Vocal Cord Dysfunction Questionnaire \\n(VCDQ) has been developed to differentiate \\nbetween patients with VCD and healthy controls \\nor between VCD and asthma. The VCDQ is a \\n12-item questionnaire on a 5-point Likert scale. \\nHigher scores have a higher probability of VCD. \\nThe VCDQ is a supportive questionnaire, but it has \\nnot been tested as a diagnostic questionnaire tool. \\nFurthermore, Pittsburgh Vocal Cord Dysfunction \\nIndex (PVCDI) assesses symptoms of throat tight -\\nness, dysphonia, absence of wheeze and triggering \\nby odours as key features differentiating VCD from \\nasthma. The PVCDI consists of a four-item binary \\nscale. A score ≥4 indicates that a diagnosis of VCD \\nis likely, with a sensitivity of 83% and a specific -\\nity of 95% for VCD diagnosis. False negatives are \\nseen in 23% of patients with VCD.

Shortness of breath \\nand chest tightness occurs in lower airway dis -\\neases (such as asthma and COPD), upper airway \\ndiseases (such as laryngeal obstruction and CRS) \\nand in cardiac illnesses. However, at times a per -\\nson’s breathing pattern, and/or his or her sensa -\\ntion of breathing difficulty, can be the main cause \\nof their breathing distress, without physiological \\nevidence. This kind of breathing distress is called \\n‘dysfunctional breathing’. There is no universally \\nagreed-upon definition for dysfunctional breath -\\ning, as the condition remains poorly character -\\nised. Dysfunctional breathing may, and often does, \\ncoexist with organic lung disease. Conversely, the \\nlack of an organic lung disease to explain breath -\\nlessness does not always imply a diagnosis of dys -\\nfunctional breathing. A diagnosis of dysfunctional \\nbreathing should be made only after exclusion \\nor adequate treatment of any organic disease. In \\nasthma, comorbidity with dysfunctional breath -\\ning and a high symptom score signalling unstable \\nasthma have been found to occur without high lev -\\nels of hyperresponsiveness. These findings indicate \\nthat misclassification happens and, in patients with \\nasthma as well as dysfunctional breathing, a higher \\nlevel of anti-asthmatic treatment might be selected \\ndue to the high symptom score. The Nijmegen \\nQuestionnaire is a 16-item assessment for dysfunc -\\ntional breathing, using a 4-point scale. An overall \\nscore >23 indicates significant hyperventilation. \\nThe Breathing Pattern Assessment Tool (BPAT) is \\na semiquantitative screening tool, which organises \\ndata obtained from a respiratory physiotherapy \\nassessment, including chest/abdominal wall move -\\nment, noise of inspiratory/expiratory flow, chan -\\nnel of inspiration/expiration, signs of air hunger \\nand respiratory rate and rhythm. Utility has been demonstrated in a severe asthma population, with \\na BPAT score ≥4, providing a 0.92 sensitivity and a \\n0.75 specificity for dysfunctional breathing in this \\npopulation.\\n7.2.11  Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux \\nDisease Questionnaire\\nSeveral extrapulmonary comorbidities contrib -\\nute to poor control in patients with difficult-to-  \\ncontrol asthma, hereafter termed ‘difficult asthma’. \\nGastro-oesophageal reflex disease (GERD) symp -\\ntoms are present in less than half of patients \\nwith asthma, with a higher frequency found \\namong patients with severe asthma. Patients \\nwith symptoms of GERD and asthma also have \\na higher frequency of asthma symptoms, with \\na higher asthma score, lower quality of life and \\nmore frequent exacerbations, but no effect on \\nthe level of lung function. A GERD diagnosis is \\nconsidered ‘proven’ when endoscopy shows posi -\\ntive signs in the gastrointestinal tract, when pH \\nmonitoring reveals a pH <4 or when the symp -\\ntom associated probability (SAP) is 95% or more \\nduring the 24-hour pH monitoring. In asthma, \\nthe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease question -\\nnaire’s (GERD-Q) sensitivity, and its specificity \\nis 71%. The GERD-Q has been developed among \\npatients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms, \\nusing a six-item assessment tool, with a score of \\n0–3 for each question. Increasing scores indicate \\nhigher risk of GERD, with a score of 3–7 equal -\\nling a 50% likelihood of GERD; a score of 8–10 \\nequalling a 79% likelihood; and a score of 11–18 \\nequalling an 89% likelihood. Another important \\nmeasure is the GERD Health Related Quality of \\nLife Questionnaire (GERD HRQL-Q), which is a \\n15-item tool concerning symptoms from the pre -\\nvious 2 weeks, with a possible score of 0–5, where \\n0 means no symptoms and 5 means very severe \\nsymptoms. The GERD HRQL-Q also includes an \\nextra, 16th question, which is an overall question \\nconcerning the patient’s satisfaction with his or \\nher situation, but it is not scored and is not taken \\nas part of the total score. The minimum possible \\nGERD HRQL-Q score is 0, and the maximum \\npossible score is 75.

SNOT-22 is a disease-  \\nspecific outcome measure and is considered the most suitable tool for assessing CRS not least patients with CRSwNP. The SNOT-22 questionnaire is a 22-item assessment tool for sino-nasal disease, based on a 0–5 scale for each question, with a total possible score of 110. A score ≥ 40 indicates likely sino-nasal \\ndisease. Mean preoperative, postoperative and no sino-nasal disease scores have been found to be 62, 23 and 11, respectively, showing the validity of the test. One issue of importance is that SNOT-22 includes various symptoms, such as asthma-like symptoms, which will lead to a high score in patients with both asthma and sino-nasal disease. The MID for SNOT-22 is 14 points, with an SD ranging from 2–16 on the differences on SNOT-22 before and after treatment. Scores 0–10 points were considered normal.\\n7.2.13   Medical Adherence \\nRating Scale\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adherence  as: ‘the extent to which the person’s \\nbehaviour, corresponds with agreed recommenda -\\ntions from a healthcare provider’. It includes the initiation  of the treatment, the implementation of \\nthe prescribed regime and the discontinuation  of \\nthe pharmacotherapy. Often, the term compliance  \\nis also used, and the two can be employed inter -\\nchangeably in research and clinical practice.\\nIn addition to classifying adherence measures as \\nsubjective and objective, many other studies have labelled them as direct  and indirect.  Direct measures \\ninclude measurement of the drug or its metabolite concentration in body fluids, such as blood or urine, evaluating the presence of a biological marker given with the drug and direct observing a patient’s \\nFigure 7.4  The relationship between the different comorbidities in upper airway diseases.

These measures can \\nbe conducted randomly or at specific intervals. Even though direct measures are the most accurate and can be used as physical evidence to prove that a patient has taken his or her medication, there are many drawbacks. These measures simply generate a yes/no result, without revealing any patterns of nonadherence or their causes.\\nEnsuring adherence to inhaled therapy poses \\na specific challenge because it is necessary for the patient, not only to administer the inhaler regu -\\nlarly and on time, but also to master the correct inhaler technique. Adherence to inhaled therapy can be difficult to assess, and self-reports are not reliable. Patients with mild asthma were formerly prescribed SABA for use as needed, but, in the new -\\nest GINA guidelines (2022), ICS-formoterol, as needed, has been recommended for treating mild asthma as it prevents asthma exacerbations better than daily SABA or ICS. However, prescribing ICS-formoterol for use as needed complicates the dis -\\ncussion of adherence among mild asthma patients.\\nIn patients, who suffer from what is called severe \\nor difficult-to-treat asthma, it is expressly impor -\\ntant to evaluate adherence, as patients with sat -\\nisfactory adherence may be given biologic drugs. Therefore, selection of an adherence tool is needed, one of which could be MARS-10 or MARS-5.\\nThe Medical Adherence Rating Scale (MARS \\n(Table 7.3 ) incorporates the features of two different \\nquestionnaires: the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) and the Medication Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ). Patients are asked to respond to each statement in the 10-point MARS questionnaire by circling the answer that best describes their behav -\\niour or attitude towards their medications during the past week. The MARS-10 has been further eval -\\nuated for the purpose of developing a shorter form, leading to the MARS-5 (which includes questions 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10). Some frequently found differ -\\nences in adherence among patients’ non-adherent behaviours occur in the measures of intentional behaviour – ‘I avoid taking it when I can’ – and non-intentional behaviour – ‘I forget to take it’, both of which are measured via a 5-point scale (5 = never, 1 = very often).\\nAs self-reports of good adherence are not reli -\\nable, other evaluation methods are necessary, such as measuring the daily use of ICS via  assessing \\nmonthly prescription issues recorded by a num -\\nber of National Health Service sources – including summary care records, local care records, general practice recording systems and/or hospital phar -\\nmacy dispensing systems. Quantifying adher -\\nence may be called the Medicine Possession Ratio (MPR), which can be calculated for an individual drug by comparing the number of prescriptions issued with the number that would be expected to be issued at full, 100% adherence ( Figure 7.5 ). One \\nyear before the initiation of a biologic and 1\\xa0year  \\nafter, three levels of adherence were defined, depending on the MPR over the preceding year: poor ( <0.5), intermediate (0.5–0.74) and good \\n(≥0.75) adherence. Patients with an MPR <0.75 \\nwere sub-optimally adherent. For patients with asthma receiving triple therapy, the mean (SD) proportion of days covered and the MPR were 0.51 (0.36) and 0.86 (0.16), respectively.\\nTable 7.3  The MARS-10 questionnaire\\nNo Question Answer\\n 1 Do you ever forget to take your medication?

It is not a guideline, rather it is a model of care. The focus is very practical. It is what works best in my setting for patients who are looking for help. Not all models of care will be the same in every setting or for every patient. Not every trait has to be assessed or treated. Treatable traits offer a framework that can be adapted to available resources and patient preferences. In some settings, such as severe asthma, a very com -\\nprehensive trait assessment is required because simpler approaches have failed, and there are many traits that require management.\\nIn mild asthma, however, it may be sufficient \\nto assess fewer and more common traits, such as T2 inflammation, airflow obstruction (traits in the airways domain) and self-management skills (traits in the behaviour/risk factor domain).\\n8.2  P RINCIPLES OF TREATABLE \\nTRAITS IN ORGANISATION \\nOF CARE\\nThe key elements of the treatable traits approach \\nare used to guide the organisation of care. These principles include those traits which must be clini -\\ncally relevant, able to be identified and able to be treated. For an individual patient, a clinically rel -\\nevant trait may be one that impacts symptoms, quality of life and/or exacerbation frequency. Trait identification markers (TIMs) represent validated measurement tools that can be used to identify a specific trait. Finally, in clinical practice, we focus on traits that have an evidence-based treatment. The treatment needs to be available, accessible to the patient and accepted by the patient.\\nThere is a long list of potentially treatable \\ntraits that can be assessed. These above criteria can be used to prioritise what traits might be focused on. Similarly, trait prevalence and treat -\\nment impact can also be used to prioritise what traits to target.\\n8.3 S EVERE ASTHMA CLINIC\\nSevere asthma is a high burden disease that by definition is refractory to high-dose inhaled ther -\\napy with ICS/LABA. A patient with severe asthma continues to experience severe symptoms and/or frequent exacerbations despite having received guideline-based step therapy. For these reasons, a systematic assessment approach that represents treatable traits is the preferred model of care for severe asthma.\\nAdditional issues relate to the assessment of \\na person with difficult-to-control asthma, who may have underlying severe asthma, or alterna -\\ntively, the person may have poor symptom control because of another reason, such as misdiagnosis, symptom misattribution or phenotype mim -\\nicry. Examples include vocal cord dysfunction which can cause both misdiagnosis of asthma and symptom misattribution. In COPD, the pres -\\nence of increased bronchodilator responsiveness is not specific for asthma and represents pheno -\\ntype mimicry. Similarly, when COPD co-exists with asthma, the dyspnea and exercise intolerance that result from incompletely reversible airflow obstruction can lead to symptom misattribution where the dyspnea is misdiagnosed as uncon -\\ntrolled asthma.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 125}),\n"," Document(page_content='110 Organising an asthma clinic\\nThese issues are common and difficult to \\naddress when using a diagnosis-based paradigm. \\nThey can frequently result in confusion between \\nphysicians around how to understand and com -\\nmunicate the clinical problem. Treatable traits \\nresolve these issues by identifying the treatable \\nproblems that are present and intervening to man -\\nage them. In severe asthma, this often takes the \\nform of systematic assessment as the preferred \\nmodel of care. The systematic assessment is used \\nto identify specific traits that might be present. \\nThis is then formulated into a management plan, \\neither by using a multi-dimensional team meeting \\n(MDT) meeting or a case manager who imple -\\nments the care plan.\\nSevere asthma is a complex heterogeneous con -\\ndition. It is complex because a single patient can \\nmanifest multiple different problems or traits. It is \\nheterogeneous because not all patients manifest all \\ntraits at the one time. The treatable traits model of \\ncare allows effective management of the complex -\\nity and heterogeneity of severe asthma.\\nA recent systematic review from 2017 of a treat -\\nable traits assessment model in severe asthma \\nshowed that airway domain had the largest num -\\nber of traits assessed (mean ± SD = 4.2 ± 1.7) \\ncompared with comorbidities (3.6 ± 2.2) and risk \\nfactors (3.9 ± 2.1). Bronchodilator reversibility and \\nairflow limitation were assessed in 92% of studies, \\nwhereas airway inflammation was only assessed \\nin 50%. Commonly assessed comorbidities were \\npsychological dysfunction, rhinosinusitis (CRS) \\n(both 73%) and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease \\nthe most commonly assessed risk factors (85% \\nand 86%, respectively). There were six outcome \\nstudies, of which five concluded that multidimen -\\nsional assessment (MDA) is effective at improv -\\ning asthma-related outcomes. Among these \\nstudies, significantly more traits were assessed \\nthan treated. MDA studies have assessed a vari -\\nety of different traits and have shown evidence \\nof improved outcomes. This promising model of \\ncare requires more research to inform which traits \\nshould be assessed, which traits should be treated \\nand what effect MDA has on patient outcomes.\\nMcDonald et al . conducted a systematic assess -\\nment of traits followed by a randomised inter -\\nvention trial in severe asthma. Participants with \\nsevere asthma had a mean ± sd of 10.44 ± 3.03 traits \\nper person, comprising 3.01 ± 1.54 pulmonary and 4.85 ± 1.86 extrapulmonary traits and 2.58 ± 1.31 \\nbehavioural/risk factors. Individualised treat -\\nment that targeted the traits was feasible and led \\nto significantly improved health-related quality \\nof life (0.86 units, p < 0.001) and asthma control \\n(Δ-ACQ of 0.73, p = 0.01).\\nIn severe asthma, these studies show that sys -\\ntematic assessment can be used to identify the \\nmultiple traits that are present in severe asthma \\nand that a treatable trait-based intervention is \\neffective. The severe asthma toolkit details require -\\nments for establishing a severe asthma service \\nbased around treatable traits are described below \\n(The Severe Asthma Toolkit: Centre of Excellence \\nin Severe asthma 2018).\\n8.3.1   How to identify traits \\nin severe asthma\\nSeveral tools and methods are available to identify \\ntraits in severe asthma ( Table 8.1 ). These include a \\nchecklist, a systematic medical record assessment \\nor a clinic-based face-to-face assessment.\\n8.3.1.1   TREATABLE TRAIT SEVERE ASTHMA \\nCHECKLIST\\nSee Table 8.1 .\\n8.3.1.2   SYSTEMATIC MEDICAL RECORD \\nASSESSMENT\\nMcDonald et al . used a severe asthma registry \\nbased around medical record assessments to iden -\\ntify treatable traits in a severe asthma population \\nwas related to exacerbation frequency.\\n8.3.1.3  CLINIC ASSESSMENT\\nA face-to-face clinic assessment can be used to \\nidentify treatable traits. In practice, this may take \\ntwo or more clinic visits and follows a systematic \\nassessment protocol.\\n8.3.1.4   DEVELOPING A TREATABLE TRAIT \\nMANAGEMENT PLAN\\nOnce the trait profile has been established by sys -\\ntematic assessment, the next step is to develop an \\nindividualised management plan for the patient. \\nThis can be achieved by using a MDT, or a case \\nmanager who liaises with the patient, and the \\ntreating clinician and implements the agreed man -\\nagement plan.(GERD; 69%).

In the last 2 years, the treatable traits approach has developed into a comprehensive management strategy using substantial charac -\\nteristics of the endotyping of asthma patients. The current knowledge regarding treatable traits has divided asthma management into three parts: pul -\\nmonary traits, extrapulmonary traits and behav -\\niours/risk factors. Future developments will likely be based on these categories.\\n9.2 F UTURE RESEARCH NEEDS\\nBiomarker-driven management of treatable pul -\\nmonary traits is mostly focused on type-2 inflam -\\nmation, including eosinophilic infiltration and type-2-related downstream cytokines such as IL4, IL5 and IL13 as well as the upstream alarmins such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TLSP). The new possibility of therapy using monoclonal antibodies has supported this movement. However, this spe -\\ncific endotype is only relevant to a subset of patients with asthma; many have problems linked to non-type-2 inflammation asthma and non-inflamma -\\ntion-related factors. Future research needs to focus more on non-type-2 asthma patients. This research should focus on identification of biomarkers of treat -\\nable traits in non-type-2 asthma. Further research is needed on how to use available anti-asthma medica -\\ntion in a more individualised and targeted way than recommended by algorithms from current guide -\\nlines. How can we effectively bring the advances of personalised medicine into existing guidelines?Additionally, research in non-pharmaceutical \\ntreatment of asthma with or without comor -\\nbidities could improve asthma control. There is great potential for non-pharmacological thera -\\npies to lead to improvements in health outcomes across multiple areas. Non-pharmaceutical treat -\\nable traits could include lifestyle factors, such as regulation of obesity with weight loss. The use of sustainable methods such as GLP-1 receptor ago -\\nnists in combination with physical activity has been shown to have permanent effects on weight loss. Weight loss has been shown to increase asthma control, but it is unknown whether the use of pharmaceutical support in weight regu -\\nlation will lead to long-lasting asthma control. Physical training in patients with mild to moder -\\nate asthma can also improve asthma control, but further research is needed for patients with severe asthma. For these patients, better asthma control through training could reduce the need for sys -\\ntemic corticosteroids and inhaled agents, possibly decreasing the number of patients taking biologic drugs.\\nPopulation-based research in asthma is impor -\\ntant, as the frequency of asthma is still increas -\\ning. How do traits vary in different settings? Are specific traits stable over time? What is the best way to prioritise traits in different settings? Newer research has pointed at other treatable traits, such as hormonal replacement therapy in menopausal women, which seems to escalate the disease mani -\\nfestation. This new research could be important in younger females who use prescription contracep -\\ntion. It is likely that there will be new treatable traits that merge in the future. What are these? How do we assess their importance and incorpo -\\nrate new treatable traits into an effective manage -\\nment programme?', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/The Asthmas.pdf', 'page': 129}),\n"," Document(page_content='114 T he future of the asthmas\\n9.3  E XCELLENT ASTHMA PAPERS \\nSUPPORTING TREATABLE \\nTRAITS\\nA selection of papers covering treatable traits is \\nshown below.\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\nBacker V, Aanaes K, Hansen S, Petersen \\nJ, von Buchwald C.

Asthma management is complex because the condition is so heterogeneous. In addition, asthma management differs depending on where you live, where you practice (e.g. outside of the hospital or in tertiary care), the severity of the asthma, the fre -\\nquency of intra and extrapulmonary comorbidities and the number of risk factors. Not all models of care will be the same in every setting or for every patient. How is it possible for a clinician to deal with this? Treatable traits offer a framework that can be adapted to available resources and patient preferences. Not every trait has to be assessed or treated. In mild to moderate asthma, assessment of dominant treatable traits (symptoms due to airflow limitation and risk of exacerbations as a result of type-2 airway inflammation) will be sufficient for the patients’ general care, whereas in moderate to severe patients, more issues and factors of impor -\\ntance may need to be assessed.\\nThe most important lesson is that the one size \\nfits all approach to asthma management needs to be changed to an approach based on the identification of treatable traits. Phenotyping and endotyping of asthma patients are a basic need in every future asthma clinic. The new non-invasive techniques for measuring inflammation and their rather low cost make measuring airway inflammation applicable in a wide range of patients and clinical settings. This is a must as there is a disconnect between airway symptoms, airway function and airway inflam -\\nmation. An asthma management approach using biomarkers of airway inflammation to guide the decisions regarding pharmaceutical drugs will lead to better outcomes and less expensive therapy com -\\nbinations. Furthermore, the use of standardised questionnaires to gather PROMs is also needed to follow significant developments in the disease and its comorbidities. In most PROMs, known clini -\\ncal important differences aid the doctor in decid -\\ning whether a reduction in asthma control is a true deterioration, as it is better to use a questionnaire – than asking the patients ‘what do you think or do you feel your asthma are controlled’. Treatable traits \\nin asthma  evaluated many PROMs of importance \\nas well as most asthma tests used in primary, sec -\\nondary and tertiary care.

Nowadays, asthma is accepted as a hetero -\\ngeneous disease; is defined as a clinical syndrome of intermittent respiratory \\nsymptoms triggered by viral upper respiratory infections, environmental \\nallergens, or other stimuli; and is characterized by nonspecific bronchial \\nhyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation. In addition, the term “severe \\nasthma” is based on the characteristic of resistance to the current standard \\ntreatment including inhaled steroid. Asthma heterogeneity is most easily rec -\\nognized in severe asthma, where patients have diverse symptom profiles and \\naltered responses to medications. Thus, identification of various phenotypes \\nof severe asthma and understanding their pathogenesis are expected to pro -\\nvide a cornerstone to develop novel therapeutics, fulfilling the unmet needs of \\npatients suffering from severe asthma. This book presents state-of-the-art \\nknowledge on severe asthma, covering general information, clinical signifi -\\ncance, pathogenesis, diagnostic modalities, and therapeutics. In particular, \\nfor readers to grasp the content easily, basic experimental data and clinical \\ninformation are simultaneously provided with intuitive schematic figures. \\nTips on management as well as cutting-edge preclinical and clinical data of \\nsevere asthma will be very helpful for medical students, researchers, general \\nphysicians, specialists, and related paramedical staff. We hope this book can \\nbe a useful guide for your research and medical practice and understanding \\nthe changes of concept of asthma and its pathophysiology.\\nJeonju, South Korea  Yong  Chul  Lee \\nJeonju, South Korea  So Ri Kim \\nTampa, FL  Seong  H.

Each asthma pheno -\\ntype may have distinct observable molecular, cel -\\nlular, morphological, functional, and clinical \\nfeatures [ 1, 2], all of which can be possibly inte -\\ngrated into specific biological mechanisms, \\ncalled as endotypes [ 3]. Although differentiating \\nasthma into various phenotypes/endotypes \\nremains speculative so far, these concepts of sep -\\naration may be useful in characterizing and pre -\\ndicting disease severity, progression, and \\nresponse to general and specific therapies includ -\\ning biologic medications [ 4]. This is particularly \\nimportant for severe asthma patients who are \\nrefractory to current standard therapies including \\ninhaled and systemic corticosteroids (CS) and \\nbronchodilators. Because these patients account \\nfor a significant proportion of health-care expen -\\nditure of asthma [ 5], recognizing the heteroge -\\nneous nature of asthma, especially severe asthma, \\nmay enable us to develop safe and effective \\nphenotype-  targeted biological therapies.Importantly, appropriate clinical phenotyping \\nof severe asthma patients, in turn, inevitably \\nrequires standardized definition of severe asthma \\nwhich can be applied to a wide range of popula -\\ntions all over the world. There have been numer -\\nous proposed definitions for severe asthma in \\nassociation with several respiratory and medical \\nsocieties. It has been also referred as difficult, \\ntherapy-resistant, as well as refractory asthma. \\nFirstly, to properly define the clinical situation of \\nsevere asthma, a prior diagnosis of asthma should \\nbe made. Then, clinical symptoms of bronchial \\nasthma should persist despite the maximal treat -\\nment of current therapies. In general, previous \\nstudies have suggested that failure of controlling \\nasthma symptoms despite the prescription of \\nhigh-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may be a \\nminimum requirement of definition for severe \\nasthma, and numerous recent works have also \\nstipulated the therapeutic level of severe asthma \\nas those equivalent to high-dose therapies [ 6] \\n(see Table  1.1).\\nThe first definitions of severe asthma were \\nproposed in 1999 and in 2000 by European \\nRespiratory Society (ERS) [ 7] and American \\nThoracic Society (ATS) [ 8], respectively ( see \\nTable  1.1). These definitions of severe, difficult-  \\nto- treatment, or therapy-resistant asthma then \\nwere incorporated into several US and European \\nsevere asthma cohorts to further understand the \\npathophysiology, to improve management, and to \\ndevelop novel therapy for the disease.

Although \\nthere were numerous differences regarding \\nnational health-care system, races, and socioeco -\\nnomic status among each study population, clini -\\ncal phenotypes of patients with severe asthma \\nwere quite similar in those studies. Subject with \\nsevere asthma were less atopic, had persistent \\nsymptoms despite high-dose controller and \\nreliever medications, and had lower lung function \\nwith incomplete reversibility after bronchodila -\\ntion [ 9–11]. Furthermore, diverse approaches on \\nasthma phenotyping using more statistical meth -\\nods (e.g., cluster analysis) [ 12] emphasized the \\nheterogeneity of severe asthma phenotypes in \\nthese cohort populations [ 13].\\nMeanwhile, with the increasing needs of a \\ndefinition of asthma severity that can be applied \\nworldwide, the World Health Organization \\n(WHO) published document on uniform defini -\\ntion of asthma severity, control, and exacerbation \\nin 2010 [ 14]. In the document, it was described \\nthat components of asthma severity comprises \\nfour components: level of control  (including cur -\\nrent clinical control over previous 2–4  weeks and \\nexacerbation over previous 6–12  months), level \\nof current treatment  (including inhalation tech -\\nnique and compliance), responsiveness to treat -\\nment  (including relative insensitivity to CS and \\nCS dependency), and risk (including likelihood \\nof exacerbations, development of chronic mor -\\nbidity such as progressive decline in lung func -\\ntion, and risk of adverse reactions from asthma \\nmedication). According to the document, severe \\nasthma can be defined by the level of clinical con -\\ntrol and risks  as “uncontrolled asthma which can \\nresult in risk of frequent severe exacerbations (or \\ndeath) and/or adverse reactions to medications \\nand/or chronic morbidity (including impaired \\nlung function or reduced lung growth in chil -\\ndren).” The significance of the uniform definition \\nof WHO is that it is applicable in all countries \\nregardless of the availability to the current asthma \\nmedication and socioeconomic status, thereby \\nallowing appropriate epidemiologic assessment \\nof severe asthma worldwide ( see Table  1.1).The most recent definitions of severe asthma \\nin several up-to-date guidelines resemble those of \\nprevious works in many ways ( see Table  1.1). For \\ninstances, in the international ERS/ATS guide -\\nlines reported in 2014, severe asthma for patients \\naged ≥6 years is defined that asthma which \\nrequires high-dose ICS and long-acting \\nβ2-agonists [LABA] or leukotriene modifier/the -\\nophylline for the previous year or systemic CS \\nfor ≥50% of the previous year to prevent it from \\nbecoming “uncontrolled” or which remains \\n“uncontrolled” despite this therapy [ 2]. In addi -\\ntion, British Thoracic Society (BTS)/Scottish \\nIntercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) \\nguideline in 2016 defines difficult asthma as per -\\nsistent symptoms and/or frequent asthma attacks \\ndespite treatment with high-dose therapies or \\ncontinuous or frequent use of oral steroids [ 6]. \\nAlthough there are still many different definitions \\nfor severe asthma available and difficulties in \\nmaking an accurate definition for severe asthma, \\nnumerous data based on these definitions consis -\\ntently demonstrate the heterogeneity of severe \\nasthma in populations with asthma [ 15, 16]. \\nFurthermore, with increasing appreciation on the \\nheterogeneity of severe asthma, recent phenotyp -\\ning of severe asthma in regard to natural history, \\nclinical and physiological features, and underly -\\ning molecular pathobiology with predictable \\nresponse to specific therapy have made the preci -\\nsion medicine possible. For example, newer \\nguidelines recommend anti-interleukin (IL)-5 \\nmonoclonal antibody particularly in adults and \\nadolescents ( ≥12 years) with severe eosinophilic \\nasthma [ 2, 17]. Indeed, these conceptual advance -\\nments reflect the beginning of the new era in \\nsevere asthma management according to pheno -\\ntype/endotype-driven approaches.\\n1.2  Epidemiology and  Clinical \\nSignificance of  Severe \\nAsthma\\nBronchial asthma is a major health problem all \\nover the world, affecting 1–18% of the popula -\\ntion in different countries [ 17]. It is estimated that \\napproximately 300 million people have asthma \\n1 Basics of  Severe Asthma in  Clinical Practice', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n"," Document(page_content='6\\nglobally including nearly 26 million asthmatic \\npatients in the USA [ 18]. In real life, bronchial \\nasthma may be associated millions of lost school \\nand work days, long-term controller medication, \\nregular and urgent health-care utilization, and \\nsignificant comorbidities. Accordingly, annual \\neconomic burden of the bronchial asthma is \\nreported to be about 56 billion dollars in the USA \\n[19]. In this regard, severe asthma has growingly \\nbecome major concern as it accounts for a dispro -\\nportionately large proportion of asthma-  \\nassociated health-care expenditures, while \\nrepresenting only a minority of total patients with \\nasthma.\\nThe exact prevalence of severe asthma is still \\nunclear partly owing to the inhomogeneity in the \\ndefinition and patient characteristics with differ -\\nent age, sex, race, and regional profiles across \\nmany population studies. For example, whereas \\nthe prevalence of severe asthma, defined strictly \\nas the disease remains uncontrolled despite \\naddressing and removing all possible factors that \\nmight aggravate the underlying disease, was \\nshown to be only 3.6% among total asthmatics in \\nthe population study from the Netherlands [ 20], \\nthe prevalence of severe asthma according to the \\ndefinition from the Global Initiative for Asthma \\n(GINA) guidelines in Sweden was reported to be \\nas high as 17.8% of adult asthmatics [ 21]. Despite \\nthese inconclusive results from numerous popu -\\nlation studies, experts generally regard that severe \\nasthma is a rare disease entity and estimated \\nprevalence of severe asthma might be up to \\n5–10% of adult patients with asthma.\\nFurthermore, there is limited information \\nregarding the exact disease burden and health \\noutcomes of severe asthma to date. The \\nEpidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: \\nOutcomes and Treatment Regimens (TENOR) \\nstudy, initiated in 2001, was a multicenter obser -\\nvational cohort study which primarily aimed to \\ncollect data to evaluate the natural history of \\nsevere or difficult-to-treat asthma. In this study, \\ninclusion of severe or difficult-to-treat asthma \\npatients was based on the physician’s assess -\\nment of asthma severity and additional criteria \\ndetermined by the frequency of urgent care vis -\\nits and/or the use of multiple controller medica -tions [ 22]. Results of the TENOR study showed \\nthat severe or difficult-to-treat asthma, regard -\\nless of age, was associated with evidently high \\nrates of health-care use despite the use of mul -\\ntiple long-  term controller medications. For \\ninstance, at the time of enrollment, more than \\n50% of patients were on three or more long-\\nterm controller medications [ 23]. However, \\n52.8% of adults ( ≥18 years of age), 43.6% ado -\\nlescents (13–17  years of age), and 53.4% of \\nchildren (6–12  years of age) reported a cortico -\\nsteroid burst (short courses of corticosteroid \\ntherapy) in the 3  months before the enrollment. \\nIn addition, 15.2% of adults, 19.1% of adoles -\\ncent, and 25.5% of children reported an emer -\\ngency department visit in the 3  months before \\nthe baseline [ 22]. Similarly, in the SARP, \\nanother large cohort of severe asthma in which \\nprimary goal was to characterize subject with \\nsevere asthma to understand pathophysiologic \\nmechanisms of the disease, severe asthma \\npatients were older with longer disease dura -\\ntion, more daily symptoms, urgent health-care \\nutilization especially intensive care, and comor -\\nbidities such as sinopulmonary infections com -\\npared to non-severe asthma [ 9]. In fact, \\nsubstantial differences exist between two stud -\\nies. Firstly, the definition of severe or difficult-\\nto- treat asthma differs from each other. While \\nSARP adopted the definition of severe asthma \\nfrom ATS Workshop in 2000 [ 8], physicians \\nwere not instructed to use specific guidelines \\nand independently assessed severity of asthma \\nin TENOR study. Secondly, SARP included all \\nasthma severities, whereas approximately 96% \\nof the cohort in TENOR study was considered \\nto have difficult-to-treat asthma based on the \\nneed for multiple drugs, occurrence of frequent \\nand severe exacerbations, inability to avoid trig -\\ngers, and complex treatment regimens [ 24]. \\nNevertheless, the similar results from these two \\nlarge cohorts emphasize the medical burden of \\nsevere asthma and thus the urgent need of novel \\ntherapeutic approaches.\\nAnother significance of TENOR is that it \\ninvolves quite a large number of populations \\nover 4000 patients, and thus numerous sub -\\ngroups having different clinical phenotypes can \\nJ.S. Jeong and Y.C. Lee', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n"," Document(page_content='7\\nbe identified. For example, patients with aspirin \\nsensitivity are associated with increased disease \\nseverity and, possibly, remodeling of the lower \\nairways [ 25]. Moreover, one of TENOR analyses \\nfound that persistent airflow limitation (defined \\nas post-  bronchodilator FEV 1/FVC ratio of ≤70% \\nat two annual consecutive visits) in patients with \\nsevere or difficult-to-treat asthma is highly prev -\\nalent up to 60% and is related to several clinical \\nand demographic factors, including older age, \\nmale, black ethnicity, current or past smoking, \\naspirin sensitivity, and longer duration of asthma \\n[26]. In another analysis, increased weight is \\nassociated with worse asthma-related outcomes \\n(e.g., poorer disease control, worse quality of \\nlife, and greater need for oral corticosteroids \\nbursts) [ 27], and female patients with IgE-\\nmediated allergic asthma are worse than the dis -\\nease of male in terms of disease severity, quality \\nof life, health-care use, disease control, and \\nallergic comorbidities [ 28]. Taken together, het -\\nerogeneous nature of severe or difficult-to-treat \\nasthma demonstrated in TENOR study, along \\nwith the similar findings in SARP [ 16], highlight \\nthat identification of important severe asthma \\nphenotypes may reduce the burden of the disease \\nand improve severe asthma-related health out -\\ncomes through phenotype-targeted therapeutic \\napproaches.\\nHowever, physicians should be aware of \\nnumerous comorbidities and confounders that \\ncan change asthma phenotypes before commenc -\\ning phenotype-based approaches in severe \\nasthma, although there has been substantial \\nadvancement in identifying phenotypes through \\nless biased and more statistically based method -\\nology [ 1] (see Table  1.2).\\nCurrent smoking or exposure to second-hand \\nsmoke may be associated with the corticosteroid-  \\nresistant inflammatory process in the lung, \\nthereby making asthma more difficult-to-  \\ntreatment [ 29]. Moreover, environmental tobacco \\nsmoke exposure on asthmatic individuals has \\nbeen reported to be associated with lower lung \\nfunction and quality of life and greater risk for \\nexacerbation, health-care use, and airway hyper-  \\nresponsiveness, thereby leading to adverse \\nasthma-related outcomes [ 30].Early-life exposures to diverse pathogenic \\nmicrobes including molds, viruses, and bacteria \\nmay also relate to severe asthma. Particularly, \\nfungal exposure has been reported to be associ -\\nated with the development [ 31] and exacerbation \\nof bronchial asthma [ 32–35]. Furthermore, epi -\\ndemiologic studies have shown that fungal \\n sensitization is found more often in asthmatic \\npatients with increasing severity, and fungal sen -\\nsitivity is a possible precipitating factor for life-\\nthreatening asthma [ 36–38]. Based on these \\nknowledges, severe asthma with fungal sensitiza -\\ntion (SAFS) has been proposed to investigate a \\nparticular phenotype of severe asthma with thera -\\npeutic implications in clinical trials [ 39]. Notably, \\nseveral recent guidelines of severe asthma recom -\\nmend allergen testing to molds in patients with \\ndifficult asthma and recurrent hospital admission \\n[6]. In addition, viral and bacterial exposure may \\npredispose susceptible individuals to initiate and \\nexacerbate allergic inflammation in the lung [ 40].\\nOccupational exposure to various chemicals \\nand compounds is also known to initiate and \\nworsen asthma in susceptible patients [ 41], and \\nchanges in the level of female sex hormones and \\nthyroid hormones may impact on clinical course \\nof bronchial asthma [ 42].

For example, \\ninhalation of environmental fungal spores also \\nled to the exacerbation of bronchial asthma con -\\ntrol illustrated by daily variation in the patient \\nsymptoms, aggravation of the underlying pulmo -\\nnary function (e.g., variations in peak expiratory \\nflow), and increased incidence for critical events \\nsuch as hospital admission and asthma-related \\ndeaths [ 32–35].\\nFurthermore, fungi can colonize, actively ger -\\nminate, and infect the human respiratory tract. \\nMoreover, they can produce a wide array of \\nenzymes and toxins closely implicated in patho -\\nlogic process such as allergic inflammation [ 44]. \\nTherefore, fungi can potently sensitize and \\ninduce host immune response, in contrast to other \\ninhalable aeroallergens such as house dust mites \\n(HDMs), animal dander, and grass pollen [ 39, \\n45]. Consistent with this knowledge, over 50% of \\npatients with severe asthma may be sensitized to \\none or more fungi [ 46], and, particularly, \\nAspergillus fumigatus  and Alternaria alternata  are common airborne fungi implicated in severe \\nasthma [ 39, 47]. Numerous epidemiologic stud -\\nies have also demonstrated that fungal sensitiza -\\ntion is found more often in asthmatic patients \\nwith increasing severity, and fungal sensitivity is \\na possible precipitating factor for life-threatening \\nasthma [ 36–38].\\nIn general, fungal sensitization/allergy-  \\nassociated conditions refer to exaggerated immune \\nresponses against non-pathogenic fungi, which are \\nmainly orchestrated by IgE and type 2 helper T \\n(TH2) cells. In contrast, the term of fungal infec -\\ntion can be applied when there is evidence of tis -\\nsue dysfunction directly associated with the \\ngrowth and invasion of pathogenic fungi in the \\nhost. There are several important disease entities \\nthat represent severe end of the fungal sensitiza -\\ntion/allergy-associated conditions, including aller -\\ngic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis \\n(ABPA)/allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis \\n(ABPM) and SAFS ( see Table  1.3) [48]. Whereas \\nABPA was firstly reported in 1952, the definition \\nof SAFS was introduced in 2006 [ 39] and has been \\nused in clinical trial settings to demonstrate the \\npossible role of antifungal therapy for treating a \\nparticular phenotype of severe asthma  associated \\nwith fungi [ 49]. Historically, early data on fungal \\nallergy were mainly derived from researches of \\nABPA/ABPM.  However, ABPA/ABPM may be a \\nsevere end of the spectrum of allergic inflamma -\\ntion against fungi that are often associated with \\nTable 1.3  Definitions of ABPA/ABPM and SAFS\\nDisease entity Definition\\nABPA/ABPM Asthma or cystic fibrosis (often \\nthat are not well controlled)\\nElevated total serum IgE (> \\n1000  IU/ml)\\nElevated IgE and/or IgG antibodies\\nImmediate skin test positive\\nSerum eosinophilia (> 1000 cells/\\nμl)\\nPresence of central (or proximal) \\nbronchiectasis\\nRadiographic pulmonary infiltrates\\nSAFS Severe asthma\\nElevated total serum IgE (< \\n1000  IU/ml)\\nSensitization to any fungus by skin \\nprick test or specific IgE\\nJ.S.

Thus, most patients sensitized to fungi with -\\nout convincing evidence of lung damage could not \\nhave been properly incorporated into specific dis -\\nease entity [ 48]. Thereafter, researchers have pro -\\nposed SAFS that can be defined as patients having \\nboth severe asthma and evidence for fungal sensi -\\ntization (i.e., positive skin prick test, positive fun -\\ngal-specific IgE in blood) without satisfying the \\ncriteria of ABPA [ 39]. Notably, several subsequent \\nclinical studies demonstrated the role of antifungal \\nagents in the treatment of SAFS patient group [ 49, \\n50]. However, whereas the definition of SAFS is \\nconvenient for the patient inclusion in clinical trial \\nsettings, there are still several problems. For \\ninstance, there are conflicting results regarding the \\neffectiveness of antifungal agents in the treatment \\nof SAFS [ 51]. These results may be in part owing \\nto the limitation in SAFS definition itself, which \\ndoesn’t represent direct causality of fungal sensiti -\\nzation in inducing severe asthma, and the absence \\nof standardized testing tools for fungal allergy. \\nFurther in-depth future researches on the role and \\ninvolved mechanism of fungi in the pathogenesis \\nof severe allergic lung inflammation should be \\nwarranted to develop more precise nomenclature \\nsystem in fungal sensitization/allergy-associated \\nconditions.\\n1.4  Conditions Mimicking \\nSevere Asthma\\nBecause clinical diagnosis of bronchial asthma is \\nlargely based on several parameters related to \\npatient’s respiratory symptoms and physiologic \\nabnormalities, which are relatively nonspecific \\nwith lack of reproducibility, bronchial asthma \\nmay be mistaken for many clinical conditions \\ninducing symptoms associated with airways \\nobstruction ( see Table  1.4). In particular, several \\ndisorders including vocal cord dysfunction \\n(VCD) and ABPA may mimic or coexist with \\nsevere asthma. Thus, clinicians should consider \\nthese diseases or other possible diagnoses when a \\npatient with a presumed diagnosis of bronchial \\nasthma inadequately responds to asthma \\nmedication.VCD, also referred as paroxysmal vocal fold \\nmotion, is one of the important mimics of severe \\nasthma. Characteristic intermittent abnormal \\nadduction of the vocal cord during respiration \\ncan establish the diagnosis of VCD.  Patients with \\nVCD often manifest stridor, wheezing, hoarse -\\nness, frequent cough, and shortness of breath; \\nhowever, the diagnosis of VCD is quite challeng -\\ning because these symptoms are frequently inter -\\nmittent. Furthermore, previous reports have \\ndemonstrated that more than 70% of asthmatics \\nhave VCD simultaneously [ 52]. Numerous \\ncauses of VCD have been suggested including \\npsychiatric disorders (e.g., depression and anxi -\\nety disorders), exercise, and irritants. Currently, \\nthere is no specific therapeutic agent for VCD, \\nand patients are often referred to exercise thera -\\npies for long-term management.\\nABPA is a complex hypersensitivity reaction \\nthat often occurs in patients with asthma (2–32% \\nof asthmatics) or cystic fibrosis when bronchi \\nbecome colonized by Aspergillus  species (mostly \\nAspergillus fumigatus ) [53, 54]. ABPA patients \\noften manifest poorly controlled underlying \\nasthma and recurrent pulmonary infiltrates. \\nGenerally, the diagnosis of ABPA is a composite \\nof clinical, radiological, and immunologic \\n features.

Compared to \\npediatric asthma in which infectious and allergic \\ncomponents play a major role in pathogenesis, \\nadult asthma has more indistinct and complicated \\ndisease pathophysiology and, thus, shows a more \\nrefractory disease course and less responsiveness \\nto treatments. Cigarette smoking, one of the other \\ncommon disease modifying factors in adult \\nasthma, can result in the development of another \\nobstructive airway disease known as chronic \\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). After the \\nage of 40, the diagnosis of COPD becomes prev -\\nalent, and the border between asthma and COPD \\nstarts to fade away [ 1, 2]. It is not uncommon to \\nhave patients who have diagnoses and/or features \\nof both asthma and COPD, and they experience \\nmore frequent exacerbations, rapid decline in \\npulmonary function, poor quality of life, and \\nhigh mortality than isolated asthma or COPD \\npatients [ 3, 4]. Therefore, understanding “asthma-\\nCOPD overlap syndrome” (ACOS) will help to deliver precision medicine to this subpopulation \\nof severe asthmatics.\\nTo comprehend ACOS, it would be best to \\nstart familiarizing with these two different dis -\\neases, asthma and COPD.\\n2.1.1   Definition\\nThe definition of ACOS has been very difficult to \\ndevelop. The current clinical description of ACOS \\nfrom a document by Global Initiative for Asthma \\nand Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive \\nLung Disease in 2015 states that “ACOS is char -\\nacterized by persistent airflow limitation with \\nseveral features usually associated with asthma \\nand several features usually associated with \\nCOPD.  ACOS is therefore identified in clinical \\npractice by the features that it shares with both \\nasthma and COPD” [ 5]. It also indicates that “A \\nspecific definition for ACOS cannot be developed \\nuntil more evidence is available about its clinical \\nphenotypes and underlying mechanisms” [ 5].\\nOne of the major obstacles to define ACOS is \\nnot about ACOS itself but to accurately define \\nasthma and COPD.  Same with ACOS, both asthma \\nand COPD are heterogeneous diseases. In order to \\ncover their different phenotypes/endotypes, the \\ncurrent definition of both asthma and COPD has \\nbeen far away from its ideal or “pure” scenarios \\nand leaned toward to real patients [ 6, 7].

There is also lack of specific guidelines \\nto treat cigarette-smoking asthmatics because \\nearly asthma researches excluded active smokers \\nor past smokers with a 10 pack-year history [ 31, \\n32]. Nonetheless, tobacco smoking is associated \\nwith poor asthma control, worsening symptoms, \\nand less responsive to glucocorticosteroids (GC) \\n[33, 34]. While pulmonary growth matures in \\nadolescent age and continues to decline thereaf -\\nter, cigarette smokers with asthma have demon -\\nstrated an accelerated lung function reduction, \\nfixed airway obstruction, and mostly neutrophilic \\ninflammation which can result in COPD [ 35]. \\nImportantly, studies have shown that the oxida -\\ntive stress from tobacco smoking directly impacts \\non histone deacetylase-2 activity and causes GC \\ninsensitivity [ 36, 37]. This finding highlights the \\nneed for further research to help to restore GC \\nsensitivity in asthmatic patients with tobacco \\nsmoking and ACOS and COPD patients [ 38].\\n2.1.4   Management and  Future \\nof ACOS\\nThe earliest idea of ACOS can be traced back to \\n1961, and Orie and colleagues hypothesize that \\nvarious forms of obstructive airway disease \\nincluding asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphy -\\nsema should all be considered as a single com -\\nmon origin with different phenotypes/endotypes. \\nThey named the disease as “chronic nonspecific \\nlung disease” [ 39]. Later, Fletcher and Pride pro -\\nposed “Dutch hypothesis” that asthma and COPD \\nare from the same source, supporting the concept \\nof Orie, whereas Kraft and Barnes suggested that \\nasthma and COPD are distinctly different, known \\nas “British hypothesis” [ 39]. Recent data suggest that there is no common genetic linkage between \\nasthma and COPD, arguing against the “Dutch \\nhypothesis” [ 18, 40]. Indeed, the term ACOS \\nmerely represents the late return of the longstand -\\ning conception between the two most common \\nobstructive airway diseases. Since the absence of \\na clear definition and clinical trials of ACOS, the \\ncomplexities of ACOS appear to be apparent, and \\nACOS research remains at a very preliminary \\nstage.\\nHowever, the fact that ACOS has not turned \\nout to be simple and unchallenging does not \\nreduce the value of ACOS.  When it is correctly \\ndiagnosed and managed, it is a very powerful \\nguidance for the precision care of severe asth -\\nmatics. It has been recognized that COPD \\npatients with eosinophilic or Th2 high type \\nrespond better to GC and vice versa, while \\nasthma with neutrophilic or Th2 low type does \\nnot respond to GC well [ 41, 42]. Correctly dif -\\nferentiating asthma between Th2 high and low \\nsubgroup is the key to diagnosis and treatment \\nof ACOS [ 43]. The differences in pathophysi -\\nology and treatment between type 2 high and \\nlow asthma will be further discussed elsewhere \\nin this book.\\nMany authors advocate to abandoning the \\nterm ACOS.  The actual underlying reason is that \\nthey felt no need to create a new vague term on \\nthe top of the already blurred definition of asthma \\nor COPD [ 44, 45]. The definitions of asthma and \\nCOPD have become vague in order to try to cover \\ntheir own overlaps, but many physicians get con -\\nfused whether to call the subgroup of patients \\n“asthma” or “COPD,” thus the advent of \\nACOS.  ACOS, the oversimplified terminology, \\nhas to be considered on a longitudinal line that \\ncontains clear directions coming from either \\n“pure” asthma (eosinophilic) or “pure” COPD \\n(neutrophilic) and moves toward to each other, as \\ndepicted in Fig.  2.1. Alternatively, the other way \\nis to discard the current concept of asthma, \\nCOPD, and ACOS and put them all under an \\numbrella of the proposed term, “inflammatory \\nlung disease,” which is comprised of “eosino -\\nphilic,” “neutrophilic,” and “paucigranulocytic” \\ntypes.

Future studies are required to fill this \\nimportant gap between asthma and COPD, as \\nthey will help to precisely diagnose and manage \\nthis subgroup of asthma patients.\\n2.2  Comorbid Conditions \\nof Severe Asthma\\nAlthough asthma could not be cured, control of \\nasthma can be achieved in the majority of patients \\nwith combinations of appropriate medications, \\neducation, and environmental control [ 6, 46]. \\nWhile experts have considered asthma as a treat -\\nable chronic disease, worldwide data including \\nemergency department visits, the frequency of \\nhospitalizations, and quality of life have shown \\nthat asthma remains to be improved in terms of \\nits diagnosis and management [ 47]. There are \\nseveral explanations to explain this enigma: (1) \\ndifferent phenotypes/endotypes that are all \\naccommodated in this heterogeneous “asthma” \\ncategory; (2) undertreatment due to either diffi -\\nculty with inhalational device administration, \\nlack of education, or poor adherence to medica -\\ntions; (3) misdiagnosis of asthma with it mimick -ing other disease such as vocal cord dysfunction \\n(VCD); and (4) uncontrollable known, unknown, \\navoidable, and unavoidable allergens and irritants \\nin the environment. Yet, another essential but \\noften overlooked aspect leading to severe or \\nrecalcitrant asthma is the comorbid conditions. \\nSome or all symptoms assessed for asthma could \\nbe contributed from either comorbid or coexist -\\ning condition [ 1, 6, 48]. Failure to identify and \\ntreat comorbid conditions in asthma is common.\\nThe term “comorbid condition” used in this \\nchapter refers to the diseases that participate in \\nthe pathophysiology of asthma and its acute \\nexacerbation and coexist without necessary con -\\ntribution to asthma. It is sometimes difficult to \\ndifferentiate asthma and comorbid conditions, \\nbut both need to be diagnosed and treated prop -\\nerly. Like any other chronic diseases, asthma, \\nparticularly severe asthma with complex comor -\\nbid conditions, requires entire individual assess -\\nment, starting from a comprehensive and detailed \\nmedical history and physical examination.\\nIn the present chapter, the main comorbid con -\\nditions associated with asthma and its acute exac -\\nerbation are reviewed in detail and summarized \\nin Table  2.1.Paucigranulocytic\\n(Asthma or COPD)\\nSABA/LABA/LAMA\\nSABA/LABA/LAMAACOSInflammatory\\nLung Disease\\nSABA/LABA/LAMAEosinophilic\\n(“Pure” Asthma) Neutrophilic\\n(“Pure” COPD)\\nMacrolides\\nPhosphodiesterase 4\\ninhibitorsInhaled corticosteroids\\nAnti-IgE monoclonal\\nantibodies\\nAnti-IL-5 monoclonal\\nantibodiesBronchial thermoplasty\\nFig. 2.2  Concept of “inflammatory lung disease,” its different subtypes, and current treatments\\nC.H.

Respiratory infec -\\ntions can be easily transmitted between upper and \\nlower airways due to similarities in their mucosal \\nstructures and innate and adaptive immune cas -\\ncades [ 49]. In asthmatics, both innate and adap -\\ntive immune responses may be impaired [ 50]. \\nAmong diverse pathogens, viruses are particu -\\nlarly recognized as a common cause and \\naccounted as high as 80–85% of pediatric and \\n80% of adult asthma exacerbations [ 51, 52]. \\nRhinoviruses are the most frequently detected \\nvirus in both pediatric and adult asthmatics [ 53]. \\nOther well-known viruses involved in asthma \\nexacerbation are respiratory syncytial viruses in \\ninfants and influenza viruses in adults [ 53]. The \\nincreased viral load in asthmatic subjects by \\ndecreased Th1 responses and augmented Th2 \\nresponses can lead to airway inflammation and \\nasthma exacerbations [ 54]. This finding is also reinforced by eliminating seasonal peaks in virus-\\ninduced asthma exacerbations with the adminis -\\ntration of omalizumab, which is an anti-IgE \\nantibody used to control the Th2 responses [ 55].\\nOther atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma \\npneumoniae  and Chlamydia pneumoniae  have \\nbeen implicated in asthma exacerbations and also \\na long-term decline in lung function [ 56]. \\nRegarding fungi, allergic bronchopulmonary \\naspergillosis is typically associated with asthma \\nand can masquerade as severe asthma (discussed \\nlater in this chapter) [ 57]. Yet, the exact effect of \\natypical bacterial and fungi exposure on asthma \\nmorbidity requires further studies to explore.\\n2.2.2   Rhinitis and  Rhinosinusitis\\nApproximately 20–50% of subjects with allergic \\nrhinitis have asthma, whereas more than 80% \\nasthma subjects have rhinitis [ 58–61].

Although the “united airways” con -\\ncept is a somewhat arbitrary slogan, it does sug -\\ngest that upper and lower airway inflammation \\nare related each other [ 63, 64]. Research has \\ndemonstrated that segmental bronchial allergen \\nprovocation in nonasthmatic allergic rhinitis \\nsubjects induces nasal allergic inflammation, \\nwhile nasal allergen provocation in allergic rhi -\\nnitis subjects results in generalized airway \\ninflammation [ 65, 66].\\nChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), another com -\\nmon upper airway inflammatory disease, \\naccounts for up to 75% of asthmatic patients, \\nirrespective of asthma severity, although the more \\nextensive CRS is associated with more severe \\nand refractory asthma [ 67]. CRS with nasal pol -\\nyps is characterized by eosinophilic Th2-skewed \\ninflammation, driven by interleukin (IL)-5 and \\neotaxin, which induces eosinophil chemotaxis, \\nactivation, and survival [ 68]. Further studies have \\ndemonstrated the presence of specific IgE to \\nStaphylococcus aureus  enterotoxin \\n(Staphylococcus aureus  colonization is a Th2-  \\nmodifying and Th2-aggravating factor in CRS), \\nhigh IL-5, and increased total IgE concentration \\nwithin the nasal polyps as a predictor of concom -\\nitant asthma [ 69, 70]. A subcategory of nasal pol -\\nyps, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease \\n(AERD), is associated with aspirin sensitization \\nand another severe asthma phenotype (discussed \\nlater in this chapter) [ 71].\\n2.2.3   Gastroesophageal Reflux \\nDisease (GERD)\\nNumerous studies have determined the close con -\\nnection between GERD and asthma. On average, \\n70% of adult asthma patients report to have \\nGERD symptom(s) [ 72–74], and 67% of adult \\n[75–81] and 56% of pediatric [ 82–89] asthmatics \\nhave abnormal esophageal pH testing. There is \\nno definite cause-and-effect relationship other \\nthan vicious cycle between asthma and \\nGERD.  Asthma can promote GERD via changes \\nin intrathoracic pressure and asthma medications \\nalter esophageal sphincter pressure [ 90]. Conversely, GERD can provoke asthma through \\nneurogenic reflexes and induce aspiration-  \\ntriggered inflammation [ 90]. GERD could also \\nlead to laryngopharyngeal hypersensitivity and \\nhyperreactivity, which often result in VCD-  \\nmimicking asthma.\\nDespite the strong correlation between asthma \\nand GERD, there is inconsistent data whether or \\nnot the effective treatment of GERD improves \\nasthma outcome. A Cochrane review in 2003 has \\ndemonstrated no overall improvement including \\nasthma symptoms, medications, and lung func -\\ntion in asthmatic subjects with GERD following \\nanti-reflux treatment although subgroups of \\npatients may gain benefit [ 91]. Subsequently, \\nmultiple studies also have failed to demonstrate \\nasthma outcome improvement aiming for asymp -\\ntomatic GERD and proximal esophageal reflux \\npatients [ 92, 93]. Results from other clinical tri -\\nals favoring asthma outcome are seen but reserved \\nfor moderate to severe GERD patients who \\nrequire surgical intervention [ 94–96]. In short, \\nonly a subgroup of asthma patients benefits from \\ntreating GERD, and the decision to treat GERD \\nhas to be individualized, remembering long-term \\nproton pump inhibitor therapy is not as benign as \\nthought [ 97–99].\\n2.2.4   Obesity and  Obstructive Sleep \\nApnea (OSA)\\nObesity has been increasing worldwide and asso -\\nciated with growing asthma prevalence [ 90]. \\nSeveral prospective studies and meta-analyses \\nhave shown higher adiposity or BMI as early as \\ninfancy can be a risk of asthma development \\n[100–103]. In addition, multiple researches and a \\nsystemic review assessing the effect of weight \\nreduction in obesity have demonstrated an \\nimprovement in asthma symptoms, medication \\nburden, and overall asthma control [ 104–107]. \\nObesity-related asthma appears to be a distinct \\nphenotype characterized by low eosinophilic \\ninflammation, low-resting lung volumes, and less \\nresponse to conventional asthma medications, \\nparticularly to ICS [ 108–111]. Such unrespon -\\nsiveness to ICS is still elusive [ 111]. Furthermore, \\nC.H.

Finally, apart from \\nasthma, obesity itself has an association with a \\nwide range of other comorbid conditions includ -\\ning GERD and OSA, which may compound the \\nunderlying respiratory disease [ 108]. To achieve \\nthe best outcome, it is critical to determine the \\ndominant composition of obesity whether or not \\na patient has an obesity-related phenotype of \\nasthma, obesity misdiagnosed as asthma, or \\nasthma with comorbid obesity.\\nAs OSA is often tied to obesity and weight \\nloss improves both conditions, the actual relation -\\nship between asthma and OSA is obscured [ 113, \\n114]. Nevertheless, both the mechanical changes \\nin OSA and the pro-inflammatory triggers from \\noxidative stress can affect the airways [ 115]. The \\nusage of chronic and/or frequent bursts of sys -\\ntemic GC for asthma can impact substantially on \\nthe development of OSA or exacerbate the under -\\nlying OSA [ 113]. Judicious usage of systemic GC \\nis important to prevent OSA, and continuous \\npositive airway pressure is essential to treat OSA \\nand subsequently help asthma [ 116–118].\\n2.2.5   Psychopathologies \\nand  Breathing Dysfunction\\nWhile schizophrenia, bipolar, and personality dis -\\norders do not correlate with asthma patients, gen -\\neral psychological disorders such as depression, \\nanxiety, and panic disorders in asthmatics are \\nmore frequent than the general population [ 48, \\n119–124]. Patients with severe or refractory \\nasthma often express more anxious, frustrated \\nfeeling and even lack of trust to physicians. These \\npsychological conditions not only cause inade -\\nquate symptom detection and perception but \\nimpair medication compliance and even follow-  up \\nadherence [ 123–127]. Increased urgent care visits \\nand hospitalization are reported in asthmatics with \\nthese psychological conditions [ 128, 129]. \\nPsychological interventions in pediatric asthma \\npatients have been reviewed in several analyses \\nbut lack substantial evidence to be conclusive \\n[130–133]. Based on the positive results from spe -cialists treating well-defined psychopathologies, \\nappropriate psychological interventions should be \\noffered to selected asthma patients [ 134].\\nThere are a few breathing dysfunction \\n conditions that can mimic asthma, and they are \\nassociated with psychopathologies [ 135]. \\nHyperventilation syndrome can affect up to 10% \\nof the population and more prevalent in female \\nasthmatics [ 136]. Successful respiratory physio -\\ntherapy targeting this over-breathing status has \\nbeen noted [ 137]. Other breathing dysfunction \\nconditions can come from either supraglottic or \\nglottic dysfunction. VCD is defined as a paradox -\\nical adduction of the vocal cords during inspira -\\ntion and can be concomitant in up to 50% asthma \\npatients [ 138]. Specific questionnaire and rhinos -\\ncopy have been developed to help identify this \\ncondition, and both speech therapy and/or psy -\\nchotherapy have shown effective in treating VCD \\n[139–141].\\n2.3  Allergic Bronchopulmonary \\nAspergillosis and  Severe \\nAsthma\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) \\nis a progressive lung disease caused by airway \\nhypersensitivity to fungi, mostly Aspergillus \\nfumigatus  (Af). Atopic individuals are linked to \\nABPA.  The inflammatory response in favor of \\nTh2 over Th1 leads to activation of IL-4, IL-5, and \\nIL-13, and IgE synthesis and eosinophil chemo -\\ntaxis. ABPA has been associated in patients with \\nasthma and cystic fibrosis and less frequent with \\nother diseases like the chronic granulomatous dis -\\nease. ABPA is mostly caused by A f and less com -\\nmonly with other fungi such as Candida  species \\nnamed as allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis.\\nPhysicians should suspect and include APBA \\nin the differential diagnosis in severe asthmatics \\nwith elevated total IgE and eosinophil level in \\nserum or sputum, pulmonary infiltrates, and \\nbronchiectasis [ 142]. While mostly largely the \\ndiagnosis of ABPA can be made with typical fea -\\ntures and matched with the criteria, some patients \\nmay have an absence of these findings which \\nmystify the diagnosis.\\n2 Heterogeneity in  Severe Asthma', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 24}),\n"," Document(page_content='20\\nComplications of ABPA include copious spu -\\ntum production, recurrent pneumonia, bronchiec -\\ntasis, and loss of lung function. Early detection \\nand diagnosis of ABPA will prevent lung damage \\nor fibrosis. Treatment of ABPA is long-term GC \\nand antifungal agents.\\n2.3.1   Prevalence\\nThe exact prevalence of ABPA globally is undeter -\\nmined. This is due to multiple factors such as lack \\nof accepted diagnostic criteria, variability in the \\nlaboratory investigations, and under-  recognition by \\nphysicians. As per the World Health Organization, \\nout of the 193 million asthmatic patients world -\\nwide, 4,837,000 patients are diagnosed with ABPA \\n[143]. Other reports demonstrate that it affects \\n1–2% of asthmatic patients, 25–28% of asthmatics \\nwith a positive skin test to Aspergillus , 7–14% in \\nGC-dependent asthmatics, and 2–15% of patients \\nwith cystic fibrosis [ 144–146].\\n2.3.2   Historical Preview\\nIn 1952, Hinson et  al. first reported ABPA in three \\npatients with multiple manifestations including \\nrecurrent episodes of wheezing, elevated serum \\neosinophils count, chronic sputum production, \\nfever, chest x-rays infiltrations, and evidence of \\nAspergillus  in histological methods [ 147]. In \\n1968, Patterson et  al. identified the first case of \\nABPA in the United States [ 148]. In 1897, Renon \\nwas the first to associate asthma and aspergillosis. \\nIn 1987, Greenberger and Patterson suggested a \\ndiagnostic criterion, which was refined by \\nSchwartz and Greenberger in 1991 [ 149].\\n2.3.3   Aspergillus  and  Relationship \\nwith  Asthma\\nABPA is a result of hypersensitivity reaction of \\nAf in the airways. The size of airborne Aspergillus  \\nspore is 2–3  μm, meaning it can reach the alveoli \\nthrough inhalation. The spores then germinate in \\nthe inflamed airway, and the hyphae can be found in the mucus of the bronchi. The spores can grow \\nat temperatures from 15  °C (59  °F) to 53  °C \\n(127.4  °F). Asthma patients can have exacerba -\\ntions when exposed to the mold-rich environ -\\nment. A f is found in air samples from both indoor \\nand water-damaged walls or ceilings.\\nIn 2005, Maurya V et  al. further investigated \\nthe relationship between sensitization to \\nAspergillus  and occurrence of APBA in patients \\nwith asthma. A total of 105 asthmatic patients \\nwere involved in the study. The subjects under -\\nwent skin testing for Aspergillus  and serum anti -\\ngens of Aspergillus , and specific IgG against \\nAspergillus  was measured. The results demon -\\nstrated an increase in the severity of asthma with \\nAspergillus  sensitization. The authors concluded \\nthat ABPA should be excluded in all patients with \\nAspergillus -sensitive asthma [ 150]. The earlier \\nstudy already confirmed the positive relationship \\nbetween mold allergen exposure and severity of \\nasthma in the study by Zureik M et  al. [151]. 1132 \\npatients aged 20–44  years with current asthma \\nand their skin prick test results were investigated. \\nAsthma severity was classified based on forced \\nexpiratory volume in one second (FEV1), the \\nnumber of asthma attacks, hospital admissions for \\nbreathing problems, and the use of GC in the past \\n12 months. Results showed the increased fre -\\nquency of sensitization to molds ( Alternaria \\nalternata  or Cladosporium herbarum , or both) \\nrelated with increasing asthma severity.\\n2.3.4   Pathophysiology\\nThe pathogenesis of ABPA is not fully eluci -\\ndated. Genetic factors are involved, including \\nHLA antigens (DR2/DR5 and DR4/DR7), IL-10 \\nand surfactant protein polymorphisms, and \\ngenetic mutations in cystic fibrosis transmem -\\nbrane conductance regulator [ 152–155]. Patients \\nwith underlying airway disease, such as asthma, \\nhave a concomitantly increased mucus secretion \\nand diminished mucociliary clearance. This leads \\nto an increase in spore trapping with decreased \\nclearance [ 150]. This animates germination of \\nspores and release of antigenic proteins that \\naggravate the immune reactions. The Aspergillus  \\nC.H.

This dilatation augments inflam -\\nmatory reaction and eventually leads to bronchi -\\nectasis and airway obstruction [ 156].\\nReactions to fungal allergens stimulate the \\nhumoral immune response mediated through the \\nelevation in A f-specific IgG, IgA, and IgE [ 157]. \\nAnother form of response may occur in ABPA \\npatients, and underlying asthma is the reaction \\nafter an acute exposure to already colonized A f in \\nthe bronchi, resulting in Th2- and IL-8-mediated \\nresponse which leads to eosinophilic and neutro -\\nphilic inflammation, respectively. Histological \\nfindings in ABPA demonstrate eosinophilic pul -\\nmonary infiltrates, bronchocentric granulomato -\\nsis, mucoid impaction of bronchi, and \\nbronchiectasis. A f allergen causes Th2 cell \\nrecruitment, which in turn releases IL-5, a cyto -\\nkine that recruits eosinophils and B cells. The \\neosinophils then release their granular contents \\nthat promote an inflammatory response. The B \\ncells promote immunoglobulin production. This \\nis determined by serum elevation of A f-specific \\nIgE and IgG, which are used for diagnostic pur -\\nposes [ 155, 158]. The fungal proteases initiate the \\nneutrophilic inflammatory response, which acts \\non epithelial cells and macrophages of the bronchi \\nand causes the release of IL-8, recruiting neutro -\\nphils. Granular products of neutrophils further \\npropagate the inflammatory response [ 155].\\n2.3.5   Clinical Features \\nand  Diagnosis\\nABPA occurs in patients with uncontrolled asthma \\nor cystic fibrosis. ABPA in severe asthmatics usu -\\nally presents with worsening of respiratory symp -\\ntoms such as frequent wheezing, increase in \\ndyspnea, cough with thick, brownish sputum or \\nplugs of mucus, and rarely hemoptysis [ 159]. \\nHistologic features include eosinophilic debris and Aspergillus  hyphae. Asthma plus systemic mani -\\nfestation such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue \\nshould make physicians suspect ABPA.  Typical \\nradiologic findings, including central bronchiecta -\\nsis, can be present in most ABPA patients. Other \\nchest x-ray findings include pulmonary parenchy -\\nmal infiltrates and fibrotic changes. A physician \\nshould be aware that ABPA comprises from mild \\nto severe, and the latter may present with central \\nbronchiectasis or end-stage lung fibrosis with \\nrespiratory failure. There are different criteria pro -\\nposed for ABPA diagnosis with no accepted one \\nunified criteria. Earlier reports for ABPA diagnosis \\ninvolve asthma, serum eosinophilia, positive \\nAspergillus  immediate skin test, and presence of \\nprecipitins to Aspergillus  antigens [ 160].\\nFurther classification involves the presence of \\ncentral bronchiectasis or without bronchiectasis \\n[161]. More specific assays for IgG to Aspergillus  \\ncan be made due to the lack of specificity of \\nAspergillus  precipitin assays [ 162]. As men -\\ntioned above, Greenberger and Patterson sug -\\ngested a diagnostic criterion, which was refined \\nby Schwartz and Greenberger in 1991 [ 149]. The \\nobstacles for ABPA diagnostic criteria are due to \\nthe recent definition of severe asthma with fungal \\nsensitization and patients with severe asthma plus \\ncoexistent fungal sensitization [ 163, 164].\\nThe main differential diagnosis for ABPA-S is \\nsevere asthma with fungal sensitization, and the \\nlevel of serum total IgE is considered the first dis -\\ntinguishing feature with a level higher than \\n1000  ng/mL in ABPA.

Other nomen -\\nclature for this disease includes Samter’s triad, \\naspirin triad, and aspirin-sensitivity triad, and it is \\nalso known as aspirin-intolerant asthma, aspirin \\n(ASA)-sensitive asthma, Widal triad, Francis \\ntriad, or Fernand-Widal triad. Some authors con -\\nsider this disease as a subclass of chronic rhinosi -\\nnusitis, while others reported the association \\nunder a subset of patients with asthma. In gen -\\neral, it affects adult population and is infrequently \\ndiagnosed in pediatric patients. The pathological \\nmechanism proposed in this disease involves \\nalterations in arachidonate metabolism and the \\noverproduction of cysteinyl leukotrienes \\n(cysLTs); other proposed theories will be dis -\\ncussed below. Eosinophilic and mast cell inflam -\\nmatory process has also been involved in \\nAERD.  This inflammatory process can be initi -\\nated even before starting aspirin.\\n2.4.1   Historical Preview\\nIn 1902, Hirschberg was first to describe a hyper -\\nsensitivity reaction to ASA, and this is followed \\nby several descriptions of hypersensitivity reac -\\ntions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \\n(NSAIDs). In 1911, Gilbert G was first to recog -\\nnize aspirin-induced asthmatic dyspnea [ 181]. \\nFurther reports followed by Widal MF et  al. as a \\ntriad of symptoms consists of nasal polyposis in \\npatients with nonallergic induced asthma and \\nASA sensitivity [ 182]. In 1967–1968, the triad \\nwas promoted further by Samter and Beers and \\nbecame known as “Samter’s triad” [ 183]. This \\nrelationship between asthma, nasal polyposis, \\nand ASA sensitivity has been recognized and \\nwidespread after Samter’s publication in 1968. \\nThe name Samter’s triad or AERD has been \\nwidely used since then. Desensitization to ASA \\nwas first described by Zeiss and Lockey in 1976. \\nSzczeklik and Stevenson developed ASA  desensitization protocols in the 1980s. The \\npathophysiology of AERD was described by \\nSzczeklik in 1990, based on the cyclooxygenase \\ntheory.\\n2.4.2   Prevalence and  Presentations\\nThe prevalence of AERD is variable, based on \\nmultiple factors such as the methods of diagnosis \\nwhether by drug challenge or history alone and \\nage of presentation. Studies have shown not \\nmuch correlation between AERD and atopy.\\nIn a study of 300 patients with suspected \\nAERD, Berges-Gimeno MP et  al. reported a \\nfemale predominance (57%) comparing to male \\n(43%) with no difference between both genders \\nregarding symptom severity [ 184]. In 2004, \\nJenkins C et  al. used oral ASA challenge as a \\ndiagnostic tool and reported a 21% of asthmatic \\nadults and 5% of asthmatic children’s suffering \\nfrom ASA sensitivity. In 2006, Pfaar O et  al. \\nreported the incidence of ASA hypersensitivity \\nranging from 0.6% to 2.5% in general popula -\\ntion, while in adult asthmatics the range is higher \\n4.3–11% [ 185]. In 2015, Rajan JP et  al. report a \\nprevalence of AERD as 7% in typical adult asth -\\nmatic patients, and the number is doubled in \\nsevere asthmatics [ 186]. Hedman J et  al. report \\nthe prevalence of ASA intolerance 5.7%, with \\nonly 1.2% experiencing aspirin-induced asthma. \\nSzczeklik A et  al. reported the mean age of pre -\\nsentation as 30 years old in a study of 500 \\naspirin-  intolerant asthma patients [ 187]. \\nSimilarly, Berges-Gimeno MP et  al. found the \\naverage age at the onset of AERD is 34  years old \\n[184].\\n2.4.3   Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of AERD can be challenging due to no \\ncurrently available in  vitro testing. Clinicians \\nshould consider AERD in patients with difficult-  \\nto- control asthma as a differential diagnosis. \\nPatients should be asked for a history of previous \\nnaso-ocular symptoms, any respiratory reaction, \\nor flare-up of asthma after ingestions of NSAIDs \\nC.H. Lin et al.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n"," Document(page_content='25\\non at least two separate occasions. Exacerbations \\nof respiratory symptoms can occur within a few \\nminutes and up to 3  h after ingestion [ 187]. Once \\nsuspecting for AERD, ASA challenge is essential \\nto confirm the diagnosis, which has been estab -\\nlished and widely used.\\nAERD patients that react to ASA can also \\nreact to other NSAIDs, which is related to inhibi -\\ntion of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 enzyme \\nand/or alteration in the pathway between prosta -\\nglandin and leukotriene.\\nAspirin challenge can be performed through \\ndifferent routes most commonly with oral admin -\\nistration in the United States. There are four \\nroutes to deliver ASA including oral, bronchial, \\nnasal, and intravenous. Some authors have sug -\\ngested nasal challenge for AERD patients with \\nisolated nasal symptoms [ 188]. If the nasal chal -\\nlenge is negative, then the patient should be eval -\\nuated with either oral or bronchial route if high \\nsuspicion for AERD.\\nIn oral challenge, patients are given with an \\ninitial dose around 20–40  mg followed by grad -\\nual up-titration to the top dose 325  mg as long as \\nno reaction. Lung function and symptoms are \\nmonitored after each dose. A positive challenge \\nis if FEV1 drops significantly and/or naso-ocular \\nsymptoms develop. In Europe, lysine aspirin, a \\nsoluble solution of 900  mg of lysine aspirin \\n(Sanofi, Paris, France) which is equivalent to \\n500 mg of ASA, is used in both bronchial and \\nnasal challenges, but this technique is not \\napproved by the Food and Drug Administration \\nin the United States [ 189]. Other in  vitro study \\nmeasuring peripheral blood basophil activation \\nby flow cytometric technique may provide future \\ndiagnostic values [ 190].\\nSome investigators evaluated another \\napproach to diagnose ASA sensitivity. White A \\net al. performed intranasal ketorolac challenge in \\n29 patients with AERD [ 191]. The results showed \\nthat nasal ketorolac challenge has a sensitivity of \\n78% and a specificity of 64%. The authors con -\\nclude that this approach is safe and considered as \\nan alternative method.\\nAERD diagnosis can be challenging if a patient \\nhas unstable asthma; in such case, oral ASA chal -\\nlenge is not recommended, and the patient should be treated first to stabilize asthma. Challenge can \\nbe performed once asthma is stable.\\n2.4.4   Pathogenesis\\nThe exact mechanism of AERD is yet to be \\nexplained. The pathogenesis is proposed from the \\nabnormal metabolism of arachidonic acid in the \\nlipoxygenase (LO) and COX pathways, and the \\nresults of unbalanced proinflammatory and anti-  \\ninflammatory mediators.\\nASA is known to block COX-mediated pros -\\ntanoid production, shunting arachidonic acid to \\nthe alternative LO metabolic pathway resulting in \\na decrease of prostaglandins and an increase in \\nleukotriene production [ 192]. CysLTs are bron -\\nchoconstrictors, and they urge mucus secretion \\nand increase vascular permeability. Increase pro -\\nduction of cysLTs after ASA challenge has been \\nvalidated in multiple studies [ 193]. Prostaglandin \\nE2 (PGE2), a prostanoid synthesized by the COX \\npathway, is known to suppress the production of \\ncysLTs through slowing the 5-LO pathway and \\nsuppresses mast cell activation [ 194]. Sestini P \\net al. validated the role of bronchodilation ability \\nof PGE2  in the lungs through inhalation tests \\nbefore aspirin challenge. Other studies confirmed \\nthat patients with AERD have a deficiency in \\nPGE2 when compared with aspirin-tolerant and \\nhealthy control subjects [ 195]. NSAIDs are \\nknown to block COX-1 activity, which leads to \\ndecrease PGE2 synthesis and promote cysLTs \\nproduction. Another study demonstrated that \\nAERD patients have upregulated 5-LO pathway \\nand further increase in cysLT production [ 188]. \\nPatients with AERD have upregulated leukotri -\\nene C4 (LTC4) which is made by LTC4 synthase \\n[196]. Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is a metabolite of \\nLTC4. Urinary LTE4 levels have been used to \\nmonitor the endogenous synthesis of cysLTs \\nbecause of its stability. AERD patients have \\nhigher basal levels of urinary LTE4 when com -\\npared with aspirin-  tolerant asthmatics [ 197]. \\nOverexpression of cysLT receptor 1 is demon -\\nstrated in nasal inflammatory leukocytes, as well \\nas a downregulation of receptor expression after \\nASA desensitization [ 198].\\n2 Heterogeneity in  Severe Asthma', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 30}),\n"," Document(page_content='26\\n2.4.5   Management and  Medications\\nThe goal of AERD management is to avoid \\nCOX-1 inhibitors. Once AERD is diagnosed, an \\navoidance medication list of ASA and NSAIDs \\nshould be provided. The safety of COX-2 inhibi -\\ntors in AERD has been evaluated. Simon RA \\net al. reported that there is no cross-sensitivity \\nbetween COX-1 inhibitors and highly selective \\nCOX-2 inhibitors [ 199]. In 2001, Szczeklik A \\net al. showed that patients with asthma could tol-\\nerate COX-2 inhibitors (rofecoxib) with no sig -\\nnificant fall in FEV1 and no significant change in \\nmean urinary LTE4 [ 200]. A meta-analysis by \\nMorales DR et  al. demonstrated the safety of \\nCOX-2 inhibitors in AERD patients [ 201]. \\nAcetaminophen is a weak COX-1 inhibitor that \\ncan be acceptable up to a dose of 650  mg in \\npatients with AERD but not at the higher dose of \\n1000  mg according to few studies [ 202].\\nThe other approach is to block the leukotriene \\npathway. There are two forms of anti-LT therapy \\napproved for asthma patients in the United States: \\nzileuton and montelukast/zafirlukast. Zileuton is \\na 5-LO inhibitor, partially blocking arachidonic \\nacid conversion into leukotriene A4. Dahlen et  al. \\ndemonstrated the ability of zileuton in decreasing \\nthe number of asthma exacerbations, improve \\npulmonary function, improve a sense of smell, \\nand decrease nonspecific bronchial hyperreactiv -\\nity to histamine [ 203]. The second form of anti-  \\nleukotriene therapy includes montelukast (10  mg \\ndaily) and zafirlukast (20  mg daily). The pharma -\\ncological mechanism is related to the ability of binding to cysLT receptor 1. A double-blind \\nplacebo-  controlled trial in by Dahlen SE et  al. \\ndemonstrated that montelukast decreases asthma \\nsymptoms and improves pulmonary function and \\nasthma-specific quality of life [ 204].\\nProper management of nasal polyps is also \\nrequired in AERD with intranasal GC in addition \\nto the selective use of systemic GC.  The duration \\nof systemic GC is variable and depends on \\npatients’ clinical response. Topical decongestants \\nsuch as oxymetazoline are a useful therapy in \\nrefractory nasal congestion not responding to \\nGC. Antibiotics can be helpful in case of sus -\\npected acute bacterial infection causing an \\nasthma flare-up. Other potential medications \\ninclude oral antihistamines and oral deconges -\\ntants although no substantial evidence supports \\nthese drugs.\\n2.4.6   Aspirin Desensitization\\nASA desensitization should be considered as an \\nessential part of management in AERD patients \\nwho required aspirin or if the conventional ther -\\napy has been failed. ASA desensitization has \\nbeen shown to be safe and well tolerated. A stan -\\ndard oral ASA desensitization protocol is \\ndepicted in Table  2.3. The severity of the lung \\nfunction decline should be evaluated before ASA \\ndesensitization.\\nIn 2003, Berges-Gimeno et  al. evaluated the \\nlong-term treatment benefit of ASA desensitization \\nfor 6 months and then followed for 1–5  years among \\nTable 2.3  Oral ASA challenge/desensitization protocol\\nTime 8 AM 11 AM 2 PM 5 PM\\nDay 1 20–40  mg 40–60  mg 60–100  mg Instruction and discharge\\nDay 2 100 mg 160 mg 325 mg Instruction and discharge\\nClinical and objective evaluation performed every 30  min and as needed. Provoking dose is repeated; symptoms are \\ntreated as indicated. Provoking dose is defined as any reaction in upper/lower respiratory system, cutaneous manifesta -\\ntion/skin rash, gastrointestinal symptoms\\nAfter the patient is completely stabilized, the provoking dose can be repeated on day 1 (if there is time). Otherwise, the \\npatient should be sent home, and the provoking dose should be repeated the next morning. FEV1 and clinical assess -\\nment every hour or with any symptoms\\nIf nasal, gastrointestinal, or cutaneous reactions occur on day 1, pretreat with histamine1 and histamine2 blocker for the \\nremainder of the challenge sequence. Generally, patients are challenged/treated with increasing doses of ASA over (in \\nour table, we used 3  h as set time interval). In case a positive reaction, then this dose will be repeated until no response \\noccurs, and dose is increased until a maximum dose is reached and tolerated\\nC.H. Lin et al.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n"," Document(page_content='27\\n172 AERD patients [ 205]. The results showed sig -\\nnificant clinical benefits including a decline in sinus \\ninfection rate, improvement in the sense of smell, \\nand ameliorated asthma symptoms. There was a \\nsustained benefit after 1  year of desensitization in \\nmost patients. Overall GC usage such as intranasal, \\ninhaled, and oral was significantly reduced.\\nIntranasal ketorolac combined with oral ASA \\ndesensitization is another alternative and safe \\nmodality [ 206]. On day 1, the patient receives \\nfour metered nasal sprays, with 30-min observa -\\ntion between doses, followed by two doses of \\n60 mg oral ASA with 90-min interval. The patient \\nwill be observed and monitored for any signs or \\nsymptoms of the reaction and lung function. On \\nday 2, the patient will have 150  mg followed by \\n325 mg of oral ASA within 3-h interval. This \\napproach may shorten the challenge duration and \\nimprove the safety profile compared with the \\nstandard oral ASA desensitization.\\n2.4.7   Surgery\\nIn refractory AERD, the surgical approach is \\nconsidered to be a treatment of choice. The ben -\\nefit of using endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) in \\nAERD needs to be further illustrated. Nakamura \\nH et al. evaluated 22 AERD patients that under -\\nwent sinus surgery [ 207]. Patients reported \\nimprovement from surgical intervention although \\nno comparison group was involved to validate the \\nsurgery. In 2006, Loehrl et  al. had 31 AERD \\npatients undergo ESS [ 208]. Patients reported \\npostoperative improvement in a 10-year follow-\\nup period and a decrease in emergency depart -\\nment visits for AERD/asthma exacerbations. \\nESS should be done to minimize the nasal polyp \\nburden before ASA desensitization for AERD \\nwith severe nasal polyposis.\\n Conclusions\\nIn summary, the pathogenesis of AERD \\ninvolves an imbalance between leukotrienes \\nand prostaglandins, and management of AERD \\ncan be challenging. ASA desensitization is a \\nsafe and specialized procedure that will \\nimprove the disease outcome while developing tolerability to ASA and other cross-reacting \\nNSAIDs. However, the benefits of long-term \\nASA therapy should be weighed against the \\nrisks such as the development of the gastroin -\\ntestinal ulcer or bleeding as proton pump \\ninhibitors could protect only the upper gastro -\\nintestinal tract. Surgical intervention in combi -\\nnation medical therapy may be a better \\napproach in severe and refractory AERD cases.\\nReferences\\n 1. van Schayck CP, Levy ML, Chen JC, Isonaka S, \\nHalbert RJ.

In addition, air -\\nway remodeling is a representative pathologic \\nhallmark of asthmatic severity, and these struc -\\ntural changes are speculated to be one of the fac -\\ntors that make it difficult to treat asthmatic \\npatients and therefore may be a target for future \\ntherapies of severe asthma [ 1, 2].\\n3.1.1   Alterations of  Bronchial \\nEpithelium\\nBronchial epithelium is composed of two major \\nairway epithelial cell types, ciliated and secretory \\ncells and is critical for preserving airway patency \\nand defending against inhaled pathogens and \\nallergens. Epithelial alterations in asthmatic patients include shedding of the epithelium, loss \\nof ciliated cells, goblet cell hyperplasia, and \\nupregulation of growth factors, cytokines, and \\nchemokines. In particular, the epithelium in \\nsevere asthma is reported to be thicker than in \\nmild-to-moderate asthma [ 3], with altered prolif -\\neration, apoptosis, and release of pro-  \\ninflammatory factors [ 4]. These epithelial \\nalterations appear to be caused by two ways: (1) \\nongoing epithelial injury due to infectious agents, \\nallergens, or inhaled particulates and (2) persis -\\ntent host immune responses (i.e., damage-  \\nassociated molecular patterns [DAMPs] or \\ndanger signals). Direct structural interruption of \\nbronchial epithelium including loss of epithelial \\nintegrity, disruption of tight junctions, impair -\\nment of barrier function, and cell death induces \\nimpaired epithelial permeability playing as a pre -\\nrequisite for antigen caption and presentation by \\nthe surrounding dendritic cells (DCs) [ 5]. In \\naddition, these epithelial injury and dysfunction \\nmay correlate with asthma severity [ 6–9]. Recent \\nstudies have demonstrated that mechanical stress \\nsuch as bronchoconstriction, a crucial character -\\nistic of asthma, initiates the activation of signal -\\ning cascades and the release of fibrotic and \\ninflammatory mediators in airway epithelial cells \\n[10–12]. Moreover, the compressive effect of \\nbronchospasm also causes mature airway epithe -\\nlial cells to move in collective fluid-like swirls \\n(unjamming), whereas otherwise they are solid-  \\nlike and virtually immobile (jamming). In bron -\\nchial epithelium from asthmatics, the recovery S.R.

These cellular motilities appear \\nalso to contribute to the defective asthmatic epi -\\nthelial function and integrity. As for ciliated epi -\\nthelial cells, although relatively few studies have \\nbeen performed than secretory cells, decreased \\nciliary beat frequency and increases in abnormal \\nciliary beating patterns and ciliary ultrastructural \\ndefects have been reported in individuals with \\nasthma compared with healthy controls [ 14]. In \\naddition, these abnormalities were more pro -\\nnounced in severe asthma. Ciliary abnormalities \\nwere accompanied by increases in the numbers \\nof dead cells and evidence of loss of epithelial \\nstructural integrity, which suggests that ciliary \\ndysfunction may be a consequence of a general -\\nized epithelial injury and can be one of contribut -\\ning factors to develop severe asthma.\\nAsthmatic airway epithelial cells respond to \\nvarious host and environmental stimuli through \\nparticipating in diverse immune and inflamma -\\ntory processes. First, asthmatic airway epithe -\\nlium secretes the cytokines TSLP, IL-25, and \\nIL-33, which act on subepithelial DCs, mast \\ncells, and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) to recruit \\nboth innate and adaptive hematopoietic cells and \\ninitiate the release of Th2 cytokines [ 15–19]. In \\naddition, a recent human study has reported that \\nin patients with severe asthma and persistent \\neosinophilia, the number of ILC2s in blood and \\nairways is substantially increased compared with \\nmild asthma suggesting that the role of epithelial-  \\nderived cytokines such as TSLP, IL-25, and \\nIL-33  in recruiting ILC2 is a more crucial com -\\nponent of the pathogenesis of eosinophilic severe \\nasthma rather than mild asthma [ 20]. On the other \\nhand, under stressful conditions including ciga -\\nrette smoking and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) \\nstimulation, bronchial epithelium seems to \\ninduce neutrophilic airway inflammation, which \\nis another phenotype of severe asthma through \\nincreased secretions of chemoattractants for neu -\\ntrophils including IL-17A, IL-6, IL-8, and \\nCXCL8 [ 21–23]. And the extent of the produc -\\ntion of these mediators is correlated positively \\nwith asthma severity [ 4]. Moreover, in patients \\nwith chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyp as \\nwell as those with severe asthma, neutrophils act as a major source of oncostatin M, an epithelial \\nbarrier disrupting cytokine participating in the \\npathogenesis of severe asthma [ 24]. Meanwhile, \\nlipoxins (LXs) are a natural anti-inflammatory \\nfactor produced at the inflamed tissue site to \\ndownregulate inflammation and to promote its \\nresolution [ 25]. Levels of LXA4 were reduced in \\nsamples from patients with severe asthma com -\\npared with levels seen in patients with mild \\nasthma [ 25, 26]. These findings suggest that \\nbronchial epithelial cells are associated with vari -\\nous phenotypes of severe asthmatic inflammation \\nas an immune and inflammatory modulator.\\nAlthough abnormalities in mucus are not lim -\\nited to severe asthma and exacerbations because \\nan increase in mucous metaplasia is seen even in \\nindividuals with stable, mild-to-moderate asthma \\n[27], more increased amount of mucin produc -\\ntion in epithelium and tenacious and viscous \\nproperty of mucus are implicated in the develop -\\nment of severe asthma [ 4, 28]. A variety of stim -\\nuli and signaling pathways have been shown to \\nregulate mucin production and secretion in air -\\nway epithelial cells. Known MUC5AC inducers \\nare usually signaled through STAT6/SAM \\ndomain-containing prostate-derived Ets factor \\n(SPDEF) activation, phosphoinositide 3-kinase \\n(PI3K)-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) \\npathway, and FoxA2 inhibition under IL-13 \\nreceptor activation or by ErbB receptor agonists \\n(i.e., EGF, TGF- α, amphiregulin) through HIF-1 \\nand MAPK pathways [ 23, 29, 30]. In addition, \\nglucocorticoids are not sufficient to suppress \\nIL-13-induced goblet cell hyperplasia [ 31]. \\nBased on these contentions, many signaling path -\\nways have evaluated the potential of drug target \\nto resolve the pathologic mucus production in \\nsteroid-resistant severe asthma.\\n3.1.2   Proliferation and  Hypertrophy \\nof Airway Smooth Muscle \\n(ASM)\\nAirway remodeling is considered to be the car -\\ndinal feature leading onto the development and \\npersistence of airflow obstruction.

In fact, \\nASM mass is increased in severe asthma com -\\npared to mild-to-  moderate asthma or chronic \\nbronchitis [ 32, 34–37], suggesting that ASM \\nincreased is related to asthma severity. In view \\nof the biology of ASM, the contractile property \\nalso contributes to induce airway obstruction in \\nasthmatics and other airway disorders com -\\npared to normal subjects, however, the differ -\\nences of contractile strength or its related \\nprotein expression between mild-to-  moderate \\nasthma and severe asthma are somewhat con -\\ntroversial. Quantitative analytic data using \\nhuman bronchial biopsy samples from mild, \\nmoderate, and severe persistent asthmatics \\nshowed that the intensity of MLCK expression \\nwas further amplified in patients with severe \\npersistent asthma, while the protein expressions \\nof α-actin and the smooth muscle myosin \\nheavy-  chain isoforms were similar in patients \\nwith asthma from all groups [ 32]. Given that \\nmany immune and inflammatory mediators \\nsuch as TNF- α, IL-17, and IL-13 have been \\nshown to increase ASM contractility and at the \\nsame time these mediators are closely associ -\\nated with asthma severity and the pathogenesis \\nof severe asthma [ 38–40], ASM contractility is \\nexpected to contribute to the pathogenesis of \\nsevere asthma, and this field still remains as \\nunanswered completely with needs more well-\\ndesigned future studies.\\nSeveral mechanisms may explain an increased \\nASM mass in asthma. First, the presence of \\nextracellular matrix (ECM) deposition such as \\ncollagen in and around ASM bundles may con -\\ntribute to the overall increase in the ASM content \\n[41, 42]. However, Benayoun et  al. have reported \\nthat the increased ASM cell size observed in \\npatients with severe persistent asthma reflects \\ntrue cell hypertrophy and not merely the pres -\\nence of collagen deposit within ASM cells [ 32]. \\nThe other mechanism is the participation of \\nfibromyocytes in forming ASM bundles [ 43]. \\nThis concept is also ambiguous in reflecting asthma severity since a quantitative analytic data \\nrevealed that α-actin-positive cells (i.e., myofi -\\nbroblast or fibromyoblast) did not vary signifi -\\ncantly between the three asthma groups of \\nintermittent, mild-to-  moderate persistent, and \\nsevere persistent asthma [ 32]. Although rela -\\ntively little information has released on the role \\nand the related mechanisms of ASM remodeling \\nin the severe asthma, a recent study enrolled the \\npatients with mild-to-moderate asthma and \\nsevere asthma has demonstrated that symptoms \\nin patients with severe asthma with increased \\nASM area are less controlled by maximal ther -\\napy than those with lower ASM area. \\nInterestingly, ASM enlargement was associated \\nwith increased expression of PAR-2 and high \\nBAL levels of their ligands, particularly mast \\ncell tryptase and KLK14 [ 44]. These findings \\nsuggest that increased ASM mass characterizes \\nthe patients with severe asthma with poor symp -\\ntom control and the delicate mechanisms for the \\nincreased ASM mass in severe asthma must be \\ndefined for the control of severe asthma.\\n3.1.3   Fibrosis, Subepithelial \\nThickening, and  Alternation \\nof ECM\\nSubepithelial thickening of airways has been \\nobserved in asthma of all severities, with deposi -\\ntion of collagens, fibronectin, tenascin, and pro -\\nteoglycans [ 45–48]. The results are not always \\nconsistent, but the majority of studies showed \\nthat severe asthmatics have thicker subepithelial \\nlayers compared to those with mild disease [ 3, \\n34, 35, 49–54]. In fact, fibrocytes are increased \\nin blood and in smooth muscle bundles in asth -\\nmatics with fixed airway obstruction and/or \\nsevere asthma [ 55, 56]. There is still debate on \\nwhether the subepithelial thickening is gradually \\ndeveloped with time as a consequence of \\nrepeated episodes of allergen exposure and bouts \\nof acute inflammation or the thickening is \\nalready formed at early stage of the natural \\ncourse of severe asthma. Many previous studies \\nhave demonstrated that chronic airway inflam -\\nmation has been considered to be the primary \\n3 Pathogenesis of  Severe Asthma', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 43}),\n"," Document(page_content='40\\nabnormality in asthma and remodeling a second -\\nary consequence [ 57, 58]. On the other hand, \\nPayne et  al. and  others have reported that subepi -\\nthelial thickening of the bronchial reticular layer \\nis an early feature of severe asthma in children \\nand appears to be a characteristic of the eosino -\\nphilic phenotype [ 54, 59]. In addition, patients \\nwith severe asthmatics also have increased \\nexpression of TGF- β isoforms and collagen \\ndeposition as compared to mild asthmatics, \\nagain in association with eosinophilic asthma, \\nwith evidence for remodeling in the peripheral \\nairways as well [ 60, 61]. Moreover, increased \\nproduction and altered composition of extracel -\\nlular matrix in the small airways are characteris -\\ntics of fatal asthma [ 61]. To sum up, these reports \\nsuggest that subepithelial thickening, ECM \\nalterations, and subepithelial fibrosis are impor -\\ntant features of severe asthma. Supporting these \\nobservations, recent studies have revealed the \\nrelated mechanisms; IL-33 promotes airway \\nremodeling in patients with steroid-resistant \\nasthma, specifically through increasing collagen \\nsecretions from airway fibroblasts [ 62]. \\nFurthermore, in severe asthma with fungal sensi -\\ntization (SAFS), IL-33 and MMP-9 are more \\nincreased in airways than the levels in non-SAFS \\n[63]. Taken together, alterations of subepithelial \\nlayer of airways are one of pathogenic character -\\nistics of severe asthma in which there may be a \\ndistinct inducer from non-severe asthma.\\n3.1.4   Vascularity and  Vascular \\nPermeability\\nA number of studies have shown a relationship \\nbetween the increased bronchial vascular remod -\\neling and the severity of asthmatic disease [ 64–\\n68]. Bronchial vascular remodeling in asthma \\nincludes vasodilation, increased blood flow, \\nangiogenesis, and increased vascular permeabil -\\nity. In addition, most inflammatory mediators \\ncause bronchial vasodilation [ 69–71]. It is also \\npostulated that the increase in bronchial micro -\\ncirculation and airway blood flow amplifies \\ninflammatory responses by acting as a gateway to \\nthe subepithelium for inflammatory cells, although some reports have demonstrated that \\nincreased airway blood flow may play a role in \\nremoving inflammatory mediators from airways \\n[72]. Moreover, the increase in the number and \\nsize of vessels can contribute to the thickening of \\nthe airway wall, which in turn may lead to critical \\nnarrowing of the bronchial lumen, as bronchial \\nsmooth muscle contraction occurs [ 73]. Among \\nvarious angiogenic growth factors, vascular \\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoi -\\netin- 1 (Ang-1) have been reported to play the \\nmost relevant roles in vascular changes in the air -\\nways of asthmatic subjects [ 74–76]. Indeed, in \\nasthmatic patients, the overproduction of VEGF \\nis implicated in asthma exacerbation, and the cir -\\nculating VEGF levels were significantly inversely \\ncorrelated with the percent predicted FEV1 sug -\\ngesting that measurement of either plasma or \\nserum VEGF level can be a valid index of asthma \\nseverity [ 77, 78]. In addition, Lee et  al. have dem -\\nonstrated that mast cells which amplify the \\ninflammation and contribute to development of \\nairway remodeling modulate vascular permeabil -\\nity through the regulation of PI3K–HIF-1 α–\\nVEGF axis in allergic asthma [ 79]. Sequentially, \\ninhibition of VEGF and/or PI3K/Akt pathway \\nattenuates peribronchial fibrosis and subepithe -\\nlial collagen deposition by reduction of trans -\\nforming growth factor (TGF)- β1 expression in \\nbronchial epithelial cells of asthmatic mice [ 80]. \\nIn mice with chronic inhaled ovalbumin (OV A) \\nexposure, potent antioxidants attenuate OV A-  \\ninduced airway remodeling including subepithe -\\nlial fibrosis through inhibition of TGF- β1 \\nproduction and PI3K/VEGF pathway [ 81]. \\nAmong class I PI3K isoforms, PI3K- δ isoform is \\nknown to contribute to the development of \\nsteroid-  resistant asthma [ 82]. More interestingly, \\nselective PI3K- δ inhibition reduces vascular per -\\nmeability and expression of VEGF through regu -\\nlation of HIF-1 α and HIF-2 α levels of the lung, \\nspecifically in bronchial epithelium [ 83, 84]. \\nTaken together, these contentions suggest that \\nvascular abnormalities in asthmatic airways are \\nmore prominent in severe asthma and VEGF-  \\nPI3K-  δ relationship is a valuable target for the \\nnovel therapeutic agents through the modulation \\nof vascular remodeling.\\nS.R.

Thus, to date, several \\nmolecular mechanisms of corticosteroid resis -\\ntance have been elucidated in severe asthmatic \\npatients providing the therapeutic potential tar -\\ngets for the cure and the control the various types \\nof severe asthmatics.\\n3.2.1   Genetic Association\\nStudies have suggested that genetic factors such \\nas bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II \\n(BMPR II) or a functional polymorphism of \\nglucocorticoid-  induced transcript 1 (GLCCI1) \\ncan affect the responsiveness for corticosteroids \\nin asthma [ 85–88]. However, to date, the infor -\\nmation on genetic association with steroid resis -\\ntance is relatively weak, and there is no evidence \\nfor the link between the polymorphisms or struc -\\ntural abnormalities in glucocorticoid receptor \\n(GR) and steroid resistance in asthmatic patients, \\nalthough a polymorphism of GR β is associated \\nwith a reduced response to corticosteroids [ 89].\\n3.2.2   Functional Changes of  GRs\\nThe GR phosphorylation by several kinases is an \\nimportant component for the reduction of GR \\nfunction through altering its binding stability, \\ntranslocation into nucleus, binding to DNA, and \\ninteraction with other proteins including tran -\\nscription factors and molecular chaperones [ 90]. \\nIn fact, p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase \\n(JNK) can phosphorylate serine 226 (Ser226) on \\nGR, which leads to the inhibition of GR binding \\nwith glucocorticoid and is mostly observed in \\nperipheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) \\nfrom asthmatics [ 91, 92]. MKP-1, an endogenous \\ninhibitor of p38 MAPK and JNK signaling, is \\nactivated by corticosteroids. In alveolar macro -\\nphages from patients with severe asthma with the reduced level of MKP-1 expression as well as \\nmurine macrophages from MKP1  gene knockout \\nmice, the reduction of steroid responsiveness has \\nbeen found [ 93, 94]. In addition, the levels of ser -\\nine/threonine phosphatase protein phosphatase \\n2A (PP2A) which can dephosphorylate GR are \\nreduced in PBMCs from patients with steroid \\nresistance [ 95]. Several microbial origin stimuli \\nsuch as Staphylococcal enterotoxin B can induce \\nsteroid resistance through GR phosphorylation \\nand GR nuclear translocation [ 96, 97]. In addi -\\ntion, GR can be nitrosylated by NO donors, \\nresulting in reduced binding affinity for cortico -\\nsteroids [ 98]. As well known, patients with severe \\nasthma produce high levels of NO, which nitro -\\nsylates the GR at HSP90 binding site, resulting in \\nthe decrease of the affinity of GR to glucocorti -\\ncoid as well as HSP90 [ 99].\\n3.2.3   GR Isoform Identity \\nand  Expression\\nGRα predominates in most cell types, but other \\nisoforms do arise as a consequence of alternative \\nsplicing, and the responsiveness to glucocorti -\\ncoids can be modulated by the relative levels of \\nthe expression of each GR isoform [ 100]. GR β \\nhas been known to act as a dominant-negative \\ninhibitor [ 101–104]. Some inflammatory envi -\\nronment increases expression of GR β in airway \\nepithelial cells and various inflammatory cells \\n[105, 106]. Moreover, TGF- β1, which is known \\nto be associated with asthmatic airway remodel -\\ning, has been shown to reduce glucocorticoid \\nresponses, partly via decreased GR α expression \\n[107].\\n3.2.4   Pro-inflammatory \\nTranscription Factor \\nActivation\\nTranscription factors NF- κB, STAT5, and AP-1 \\nhave been implicated in the occurrence of steroid \\nresistance in inflammatory cells.

In addition, activation of IRF-1 by \\nIFNs or TNF- α may contribute to steroid resis -\\ntance in airway smooth muscle cells [ 112].\\n3.2.5   Defective Histone Acetylation\\nIn asthmatics, there is strong evidence connecting \\ndecreased HDAC2 activity with steroid resistance; \\nmolecular mechanisms for the decreases in HDAC2 \\nexpression/activity have been elucidated recently \\n[113–115].

These \\nfindings suggest that oxidative stress and activation \\nof PI3K- δ signaling might be important mecha -\\nnisms for steroid resistance in bronchial asthma.\\n3.2.6   Immune Mechanisms\\nDespite little information on the direct relationship \\nwith steroid resistance in airway disorders, murine \\nTh17 cells seem to be steroid resistant [ 117]. In \\naddition, IL-17 increases the expression of GR β in \\nairway epithelial cells [ 105]. The decrease of the \\nsecretion of IL-10  in regulatory T cells has been \\nreported in patients with steroid-  resistant asthma \\n[118, 119]. However, there is very scarce available \\ninformation on immune mechanisms associated \\nwith steroid resistance to date.\\n3.3  Type 2 Inflammation\\nMolecular features of severe asthma have largely \\nfocused on the presence or extent of type 2 inflam -\\nmatory responses, which involve the typical aller -\\ngic inflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. \\nOf course, it is well known that all asthmatics \\nfrom mild disease to severe one possess the type 2 inflammatory signature [ 120–123]; however, in \\nmild asthmatics, the presence of a type 2 inflam -\\nmatory process appears to be linked to early-onset \\nand allergic disease, while in severe asthma, the \\nrelationship with allergy seems to be lower than \\nthat in mild asthma [ 124–126]. Despite these dif -\\nferences, new asthma treatments targeting Th2 \\ncytokines or their receptors have been developed \\nby many pharmaceutical agencies. These thera -\\npies have consistently blocked Th2 inflammation \\nand associated structural changes in the airways \\nof antigen-  challenged animal models; however, \\nfew have been successful when moved to the \\nclinic [ 127]. Interestingly, based on the gathering \\ndata from various cohort analyses, severe asth -\\nmatics appear to exhibit more favorable therapeu -\\ntic efficacy than mild or total asthmatic patients \\nwhen Type 2 or Th2 inflammation-targeting med -\\nicine is applied, showing that many cases of \\nsevere asthma involve cells of both the innate and \\nadaptive immune systems, often in association \\nwith other immune pathways [ 128].\\n3.3.1   T Helper Type 2 (Th2) Cell-  \\nDependent Inflammations\\nUnder Th1/Th2 paradigm, the traditional asthma \\nwas accepted as an airway inflammatory disorder \\ndriven by Th2-predominant immune response of \\nadaptive immune system. Since a type 2 or Th2 \\ninflammation plays an important role in the \\npathogenesis in all types of asthma, GATA3 or \\nSTAT6, a transcription factor expressed in Th2 \\ncells and linked to expression of Th2-specific \\ncytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, has been \\nestablished as an attractive target in the treatment \\nof asthma associated with Th2 responses [ 129–\\n133]. Thus, in severe asthma showing limited \\nresponses to corticosteroid therapy in suppress -\\ning Th2 cytokines, GATA3 or STAT6 inhibition \\nappears to be an alternative therapeutic approach \\nfor severe asthma [ 134, 135]. Moreover, because \\nTh2 cells have been recognized as an important \\npart of the mechanisms underlying asthma, a \\nTh2-high asthma has been defined by the use of \\ngenes expressed in airway epithelial brushings, \\nconsisting of a set of IL-13-inducible genes com -\\nS.R.

Interesting finding is that only about 50% \\nof patients with mild-to-moderate asthma had a \\nTh2-high asthma phenotype and they exhibit \\nmore severe asthmatic manifestations including \\nairway eosinophilia which has led to drawn the \\nconcept of Th2-high and Th2-low endotypes. \\nSubsequently, several recent studies have \\nrevealed that in Th2-high severe asthmatics \\nshowing increased levels of type 2 inflammatory \\nbiomarkers (i.e., eosinophilia, exhaled nitric \\noxide (FeNO), and periostin), IL-4/13 or IL-5-  \\ndirected therapies have shown promising results \\nin each specific subgroup [ 137–154]. In fact, \\nanti-IL-5 therapy significantly attenuated asthma \\nsymptoms, reduced exacerbation, improved lung \\nfunction, and showed sparing effect of oral corti -\\ncosteroid in severe asthmatic patients with blood \\nor sputum eosinophilia [ 143–146, 155]. In addi -\\ntion, in patients with modestly elevated levels of \\nblood eosinophils, treatment with the anti-IL-  \\n4Rα antibody therapy maintained and even \\nimproved asthma control in moderate-to-severe \\nasthma [ 138]. Interestingly, the IL-13 antibody \\nwas only modestly efficacious in the total patient \\ncohort, but it markedly improved lung function in \\npatients with high-serum periostin levels [ 137]. \\nAltogether, substantial evidence now supports \\nthe presence of ongoing type 2 inflammation in \\nsevere asthma, which can be successfully tar -\\ngeted to improve outcome. Given that type 2 \\ninflammation exists in total asthmatics with all \\nseverities including mild asthma and the cortico -\\nsteroid resistance is not usually observed in mild \\nasthmatics, in the pathogenesis of severe asthma, \\ntype 2 cytokines from Th2 cells seem to function \\nwith other cytokines and/or mediators to affect \\nvarious target cells, including mast cells, eosino -\\nphils, epithelial cells, and airway smooth muscle \\ncells, in which there are needs to be further inves -\\ntigated to define more specific mechanisms.\\n3.3.2   Innate Lymphoid Type 2 \\nCell-Associated Inflammation\\nIn addition to Th2 cells, cells of the innate \\nimmune system, such as NKT cells, alternatively activated macrophages, eosinophils, and mast \\ncells, can produce type 2 cytokines [ 156]. Above \\nall, recently ILC2s have unveiled their roles in \\nthe pathogenesis of severe asthma producing sig -\\nnificant amount of the type 2 cytokines, espe -\\ncially IL-5 and IL-13 under the influence of \\nepithelial cell-derived cytokines TSLP, IL-25, \\nIL-33, and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) [ 157–161]. \\nSince approximately 25% of patients with severe \\nasthma do not display atopy, it is possible that \\nthere are other environmental triggers that induce \\na type 2 response without invoking a Th2 \\nresponse. Actually, epithelial cells can release \\nthese cytokines by the stimulation of proteases \\nfrom various pathogen-associated molecular pat -\\nterns (PAMPs; i.e., viruses, bacteria, and aller -\\ngens) [ 162–164]. More interestingly, an in  vitro \\nstudy has demonstrated that both cultured T cells \\nand ILC2s secreted IL-5 and IL-13 under rhino -\\nvirus infection showing more potent capacity of \\nTh2 cytokine secretion in ILC2s than T cells \\n[165]. This finding provide the message that Th2 \\nor type 2 inflammation is able to be induced pow -\\nerfully without antigen/allergen specificity by the \\nepithelial activation linked to type 2 cytokine \\nproduction of ILC2s through their mediators \\nTSLP, IL-25, and IL-33. While there are still \\ndebates on the measurement of ILC2 numbers in \\nlung, severe asthmatics harbor greater numbers \\nof activated ILC2s in airways as compared with \\nmilder asthmatics or healthy controls [ 20, 166]. \\nThe importance of ILC2  in the pathogenesis of \\nsevere asthma is also emphasized by many \\nresearchers and clinicians along with needs for \\nfuture investigations to define the mechanisms of \\nILC2 activation and specific contributions to \\nsevere asthma for the novel therapeutic approach \\nto severe asthma.\\n3.4  Non-type 2 Inflammation\\nAs described above, approximately half of all \\nasthmatic patients do not have evidence of type 2 \\ninflammation [ 123, 167, 168]. “Type 2-low \\nasthma” is currently defined as the “apparent” \\nabsence of type 2 cytokines and their downstream \\nsignatures.

With narrow -\\ning the scope, it is increasingly clear that severe \\nasthma has also various phenotypes [ 172]. \\nActually, in some subjects with severe asthma, \\nneutrophils, in addition to eosinophils, are impor -\\ntant effector cells [ 60, 173–175]. Furthermore, \\nnon-Th2 cytokines such as IFN- γ, IL-8, IL-18, \\nand IL-17 have been observed to be elevated in \\nsubjects with severe asthma [ 46, 176–178].\\n3.4.1   Inflammasome\\nIn allergic airway inflammation, briefly, the \\ninnate immune system senses various allergens \\nsuch as dust mites and molds via pattern recogni -\\ntion receptors (PRRs) including TLR, CLR, and/\\nor NLRs. Several members of the cytosolic NLR \\nfamily (NLRP1, NLRP3, and NLRC4) act as \\ncentral components of the multiprotein inflam -\\nmasome complex [ 179]. Inflammasomes are a \\ngroup of protein complexes that recognize a \\ndiverse set of inflammation-inducing stimuli and \\nthat control production of important pro-  \\ninflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 β and IL-18 \\n[180]. Unlikely other NLR family members \\nwhich have been activated by each specific stim -\\nulus, NLRP3 is activated by a large variety of sig -\\nnals, including PAMPs, DAMPs, and bacterial \\ntoxins [ 181–183]. More interestingly, studies \\nhave demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome \\nactivation is critical for the induction of allergic \\nairway inflammation in bronchial asthma [ 184, \\n185], with increased understanding of how adap -\\ntive and innate immunity generate downstream \\npathology of allergic inflammation [ 186]. \\nFurthermore, as for severe asthma, recent inter -\\nesting studies have revealed that steroid-resistant \\nneutrophilic asthmatic manifestations were sig -\\nnificantly controlled by the NLRP3 inflamma -\\nsome activation and the severe asthmatic \\nsymptoms were dramatically attenuated by the \\nblockade of IL-1 β [187, 188]. More supportively, \\nvery recent transcriptomic analysis with sputum \\nfrom moderate-to-severe asthma revealed that non-Th2 phenotypes included two transcriptome-  \\nassociated clusters (TACs); one cluster is charac -\\nterized by IFN- γ, TNF- α, and \\ninflammasome-associated genes, and the other \\ncluster is represented by genes of metabolic path -\\nways, ubiquitination, and mitochondrial function \\n[189]. Taken together, emerging evidence has \\nsuggested that inflammasome, specifically \\nNLRP3 inflammasome and its effector pro-  \\ninflammatory cytokines IL-1 β and/or IL-18, \\nplays a critical role in steroid-refractory severe \\nasthma providing a very promising target for the \\ncontrol of severe asthma, especially non-  \\neosinophilic type.\\n3.4.2   TNF-α\\nTNF- α contributes to neutrophilic inflammation \\nand airway hyperresponsiveness in murine mod -\\nels [190]. An interesting study enrolled patients \\nwith corticosteroid-refractory severe asthma \\nreported that a soluble TNF- α receptor inhibitor \\nincreased post-bronchodilator FEV1 and \\ndecreased bronchial hyperresponsiveness com -\\npared with placebo [ 191]. However, one subse -\\nquent double-blind, randomized, \\nplacebo-controlled trial confirmed there were \\nonly small improvements in asthma control and \\nsystemic inflammation after 12  weeks of etaner -\\ncept therapy compared with placebo [ 192]. \\nSimilarly, a large-scaled clinical trial using a \\nhumanized monoclonal antibody for TNF- α, \\ngolimumab, in patients with severe refractory \\nasthma to high-dose ICS/LABA treatment did \\nnot improve lung function or reduce acute exac -\\nerbations [ 193]. Moreover, it was associated with \\nincreases in systemic infections and cancer, \\nwhich led this trial to premature termination \\n[193]. Considering that TNF- α is a \\n pro- inflammatory Th1 cytokine that induces acti -\\nvation of macrophages and neutrophilic inflam -\\nmation which linked to severe asthmatic \\nphenotypes, it can be hypothesized as a potential \\ntarget for the control of severe asthma. However, \\nuntil present time, substantial evidence has indi -\\ncated that blockade of TNF- α is not recom -\\nmended at least for the control of severe asthma \\nS.R.

Although \\nIFN- γ has been traditionally associated with the \\nprotective role against viral and bacterial infec -\\ntions, several studies have revealed that IFN- γ is \\nimplicated in the pathogenesis of severe asthma \\n[202–204]. Moreover, severe asthmatics showed \\nincreased levels of IFN- γ-expressing cells in sub -\\nepithelium compared with the levels of mild or \\nmoderate asthmatics [ 178].\\nThe contribution of IFN- γ to the pathogenesis \\nof severe asthma can potentially be related to sev -\\neral situations. IFN- γ is usually induced by vari -\\nous infections which are closely linked to severe \\nasthma and acute exacerbation of asthma [ 205]. \\nIn fact, under infectious condition, the generation \\nof intracellular messenger cyclic-di-GMP \\ninduces type I IFNs as well as Th1 and Th17 \\nimmune responses mixed with a low Th2 \\nresponse [ 206]. Additionally, a mixed Th1 and \\nTh17 immune response along with a low Th2 \\nresponse induced by a combination of HDM \\nallergen and cyclic-di-GMP in the airways of \\nmice was detectable even in the presence of a \\nhigh dose of CS, mimicking the CS-refractory \\nimmune response in severe asthmatics [ 134]. \\nWhen IFN- γ knockout mice and wild-type mice \\nwere subjected to the same experimental proto -\\ncol, increased airway hyperresponsiveness in \\nwild-type mice was completely attenuated in \\nIFN- γ knockout mice suggesting the pathogenic \\nrole of IFN- γ in the severe asthma [ 134].\\nMeanwhile, IL-18 is also known as IFN- γ- \\ninducing factor.

Supportively, IFN- γ also synergizes with \\ntype 2 cytokines such as IL-13 to promote nitro-  \\noxidative stress in airway epithelial cells [ 208]. \\nChronic asthma model using IL-18 deficient \\nmice revealed low IFN- γ level in BAL fluids \\nwhich lead to less airway inflammation and \\nremodeling [ 209]. In addition, as described above \\nIL-18 is one of effector cytokines produced by \\nNLRP3 inflammasome which is closely associ -\\nated with the development, of neutrophilic \\nsteroid-  resistant asthma [ 187]. In the neutrophilic \\nsteroid-resistant asthma model, IFN- γ expression \\nwas also significantly increased in lung tissues of \\nmice indicating the association of IFN- γ with \\ninnate immune response such as NLRP3 inflam -\\nmasome activation participated in the induction \\nand maintenance of severe asthma.\\nAnother factor associated with IFN- γ is secre -\\ntory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) with \\nreverse correlation and is reported as a link \\nbetween IFN- γ and airway hyperresponsiveness \\n[134, 210].

Considering the \\nimportant action of TGF- β in airway remodeling, \\ninverse correlation between SLPI and TGF- β can \\nbe responsible for persistent airway hyperrespon -\\nsiveness in high IFN- γ condition of severe asthma \\n[212, 213]. Taken together, the IFN- γ signaling \\npathway appears to be associated with disease \\nseverity and phenotypes of severe asthma in \\nmany ways.\\n3.5  Subcellular Organelles\\n3.5.1   Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)\\nThe ER is a specialized organelle that plays a \\ncentral role in the biosynthesis, correct protein \\nfolding, and posttranslational modifications of \\nsecretory and membrane proteins [ 214, 215]. When ER is stressed by some conditions such as \\nincreased demand in protein folding load in ER \\nlumen, cells evolve an adaptive response called \\nunfolded protein response (UPR). For the normal \\nmolecular transport, the secretory pathway and \\nthe ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway \\nshould keep their intact systems with working \\nnormally [ 215, 216]. Any perturbations of these \\nconditions including failure of the ER’s adaptive \\ncapacity can reduce the ability of ER to perform \\nthe normal physiologic roles, causing ER stress. \\nER stress causes accumulation of unfolded and/\\nor misfolded proteins in ER, interferes with pro -\\ntein synthesis and secretion, induces reactive \\noxygen species (ROS) generation, and increases \\ninflammation partly via NF- κB activation [ 217]. \\nRecent studies have unveiled the role of ER stress \\nin the pathogenesis of various pulmonary disor -\\nders, including asthma, chronic obstructive pul -\\nmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary \\nfibrosis, and acute lung injury [ 198, 218–220]. In \\nparticular, neutrophilic steroid-resistant severe \\nasthma animal model induced by OV A and LPS \\nsensitization and challenge exhibited the signifi -\\ncant increases in ER stress markers, glucose-  \\nregulated protein 78 (GRP78), and CCAAT/\\nenhancer-binding protein homologous protein \\n(CHOP), as well as UPR-related proteins in lung \\ntissues and BAL cells [ 198]. More intriguingly, \\nan ER stress regulator, 4-phenylbutyric acid \\n(4-PBA), effectively attenuated steroid-refractory \\nasthmatic features including bronchial hyperre -\\nsponsiveness and airway inflammation as well as \\nincreases in ER stress linked to NF- κB activation \\nwhich induces various severe inflammatory/\\nimmune responses in the lung. In particular, \\n4-PBA dramatically reduced the increased \\nexpression of IL-17, whereas it further enhanced \\nthe increase in IL-10 levels, resulting in the atten -\\nuation of steroid-resistant asthmatic features. \\nMoreover, the additional data using LPS-  \\nstimulated airway epithelial cells revealed a posi -\\ntive feedback interaction between IL-17 and ER \\nstress [ 22]. Consistent with this contention, a \\nrecent study has demonstrated that ER stress \\ninducer, tunicamycin, aggravates ER stress in \\nmouse bronchial epithelial cells and increased \\nexpression of inflammation indicators such as \\nS.R.

In addition to \\nneutrophilic severe asthmatic phenotype, \\neosinophil-  dominant severe asthma with fungal \\nsensitization (SAFS) also showed the significant \\nelevation of ER stress in mice [ 222]. In this study, \\nfungal allergen (i.e., Aspergillus fumigatus )-\\ninhaled mice showed typical asthmatic manifes -\\ntations including eosinophilic airway \\ninflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness \\nwhich were not responded to treatment with oral \\nsteroid, while all asthmatic features and increased \\nER stress were very well controlled by the phar -\\nmacologic blockade of PI3K- δ activity, suggest -\\ning that PI3K- δ is linked to the modulation of ER \\nstress in fungus-related severe asthmatic \\ninflammation.\\nThe double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated \\nserine/threonine kinase R (PKR) is well charac -\\nterized as an essential component of the innate \\nantiviral response. In view of the relation with \\nER stress, PKR phosphorylates e-IF2 α, one of \\nthe branches for UPR, and, at the same time, ER \\nstress activates PKR which stimulates various \\ninflammatory signaling pathways [ 223, 224]. \\nWith these background, a recent interesting study \\nshowed that poly (I:C)-induced exacerbation of \\nneutrophilic severe asthmatic mice was closely \\nassociated with PKR phosphorylation as well as \\nincreased ER stress in lung tissues including \\nbronchial epithelial cells [ 224].\\nThese observations suggest that ER stress \\nplays a critical role in pathogenesis of various \\nphenotypes of severe asthma including neutro -\\nphilic, eosinophilic, and infection-related types, \\nsupporting that the ER stress targeting strategy \\nseems to be able to overcome the steroid resis -\\ntance in severe asthma.\\n3.5.2   Mitochondrial Dysfunction\\nMitochondria are dynamic double-membrane \\norganelles and possess their own genome and \\nproteome [ 225]. They are associated with the \\nsynthesis and catabolism of metabolites, genera -\\ntion and detoxification of ROS, apoptosis, regula -\\ntion of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial matrix calcium, and generation of adenosine triphos -\\nphate (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation [ 226]. \\nIn addition, recent evidence has uncovered that \\nthe roles of mitochondria as a direct inflamma -\\ntory and immune controller are not worked only \\nby metabolic dysfunction such as mitochondrial \\nROS but also by their abnormal dynamics (i.e., \\nfusion and fission) [ 179, 227–229]. With these \\nnew concept of mitochondrial biological roles, \\nmitochondrial abnormalities appear to be impli -\\ncated in the pathogenesis of various pulmonary \\ndisorders such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive \\npulmonary disorders (COPD), asthma, cystic \\nfibrosis, and so on [ 230]. Particularly, recent \\nexperimental data revealed that increased genera -\\ntion of mitochondria ROS and alteration of mito -\\nchondrial DNA induced steroid-resistant \\nneutrophilic asthmatic features through the \\nactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome in the lung \\nand that restoration of mitochondrial ROS lev -\\nels using mitochondrial-specific ROS scaven -\\nger dramatically attenuated steroid-resistant \\nairway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation in \\nmice [ 187].\\nAlthough more future researches and studies \\nare needed to support the role of mitochondria in \\nthe pathogenesis of severe asthma, considering the \\nclassic importance of oxidative stress including \\nROS in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma and \\nthe development of steroid resistance and to date \\ndisappointing results with the effects of antioxi -\\ndant supplementation in human studies for asthma, \\nit is expected that mitochondria-related pathogenic \\nmechanisms can be a key to solve the several \\nobstacles on the way to cure severe asthma.\\nReferences\\n 1.

Glaum\\n4.1  Diagnostic Significance \\nof Pulmonary Function \\nTesting in  Severe Asthma\\nPulmonary function testing (PFT) includes vari -\\nous components that are divided into categories \\nbased on the type of lung function they measure, \\nincluding spirometry, lung volumes, diffusing \\ncapacity, blood gas assessment, and exercise \\nchallenge. Among them, spirometry is the most \\nwidely used for monitoring progression of lung \\ndisease and response to treatment.\\nIn severe asthma, many physiologic abnor -\\nmalities occur, including airflow limitation, \\nincreased airway resistance, loss of lung elastic \\nrecoil, increased gas trapping, and ventilation/\\nperfusion mismatch [ 1–12]. In addition, patients \\nwith severe asthma tend to have more airway \\nhyperresponsiveness than those with mild-to-  \\nmoderate disease [ 10, 11, 13]. These abnormali -\\nties lead to characteristic changes in PFT \\nmeasurements including decreases in forced \\nexpiratory volume at 1  s (FEV1), forced vital \\ncapacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEF), increases in residual volume to total lung \\ncapacity ratio (RV/TLC), body plethysmography, \\nand forced oscillation technique (FOT) [ 14–20]. \\nEach of these abnormalities is associated with \\nloss of asthma control [ 21].\\nAccording to ERS/ATS (European Respiratory \\nSociety/American Thoracic Society) guidelines \\n[22], severe asthma is defined as asthma (patients \\naged ≥6 years) that requires ongoing treatment \\nwith guideline-based medications for GINA \\n(Global Initiative for Asthma) steps 4–5 (high-  \\ndose ICS (inhaled corticosteroids) and LABA \\n(long-acting β adrenoceptor agonists) or leukotri -\\nene modifier/theophylline) for the previous 1 \\nyear or systemic corticosteroids for 50% of the \\nprevious 1 year to maintain control or which \\nremains uncontrolled despite this therapy. One of \\nthe main criteria of “uncontrolled asthma” is air -\\nflow limitation defined as FEV1 <80% predicted \\n(pre-bronchodilator) in the presence of a reduced \\nFEV1/FVC (less than 0.7) [ 22].\\nIn the evaluation of severe asthma, clinicians \\nmust first rule out comorbid conditions that \\nmimic or exacerbate asthma including laryngeal/\\npharyngeal reflux, chronic rhinosinusitis, vocal \\ncord dysfunction syndrome, and other cardiopul -\\nmonary syndromes. After a thorough history and \\nexamination, spirometry should be performed \\nwith both expiratory and inspiratory flow/vol -\\nume loops pre- and post-bronchodilator admin -\\nistration [ 23].

If there are inconsistencies \\namong history, physical features, and spirome -\\ntry, other pulmonary function tests may be con -\\nsidered including diffusing capacity and \\nbronchoprovocation testing, such as methacho -\\nline or exercise challenges (only in patients with \\nrelatively preserved lung function). After the \\ndiagnosis of asthma is confirmed, clinicians \\nshould continually evaluate patients’ severity \\nand control status based on symptom control, \\nfrequency of exacerbations, pulmonary function, \\nrescue medication requirement, and quality of \\nlife measurement according to guideline-based \\nrecommendations.\\nSevere asthma is considered to be a group of \\nheterogeneous diseases caused by different trig -\\ngers and pathophysiological mechanisms [ 24]. \\nTo better understand this heterogeneity and \\nimprove asthma management, efforts have been \\nmade to characterize asthma phenotypes. In the \\nidentification of phenotypes, spirometry is rou -\\ntinely performed to define important parameters \\nsuch as pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1, \\nFVC, FEV1/FVC ratio, PEF variability, and \\nmethacholine PC20 (concentration producing a \\n20% fall of FEV1) to evaluate airway obstruction \\nand potential reversibility in both adults and chil -\\ndren [ 25–29]. Schatz et  al. recommended FEV1 \\nas a central parameter in defining phenotypes \\n[30]. Moore et  al. of the SARP generated an algo -\\nrithm using three variables: (1) baseline pre-  \\nbronchodilator FEV1, (2) maximal “max” FEV1 \\n(post-bronchodilator FEV1, after 6–8 puffs of \\nalbuterol), and (3) age of onset of asthma. \\nThrough this algorithm, 80% of study subjects \\nwere assigned to the appropriate cluster from \\nmilder asthma (Cluster 1) to more severe disease \\n(Clusters 4 and 5) [ 26]. Recently, the concept of \\noverlap of asthma and COPD (chronic obstruc -\\ntive pulmonary) has garnered much attention. \\nGINA described this entity as asthma-COPD \\noverlap syndrome (ACOS) and defined it as per -\\nsistent airflow limitation with several features \\nusually associated with asthma and several fea -\\ntures usually associated with COPD [ 31]. These \\npatients typically demonstrate incompletely \\nreversible airflow limitation with less than 12% reversibility of FEV1 post-bronchodilator along \\nwith FEV1 <80% predicted and FEV1/FVC% \\n<0.7 [ 32].\\nIn the evaluation of therapeutic response to \\nasthma medications, spirometry is frequently \\nused as an outcome measure. Most clinical trials \\nexamining the effectiveness of a biologic drug in \\nasthma, including omalizumab, mepolizumab, \\nreslizumab, and lebrikizumab, utilized spiromet -\\nric parameters (mainly FEV1) as a key indicator \\nof clinical effectiveness. In daily assessment of \\nasthma control, the PEFR (peak expiratory flow \\nrate) is widely used by patients at home as a sur -\\nrogate measure of FEV1 [ 33]. GINA asthma \\ntreatment guidelines recommend that spirometry \\nbe performed before treatment, 3–6  months later, \\nand then annually [ 34].\\nAmong all spirometric parameters, the FEV1 \\nis the most reproducible and well standardized \\n[35], and it is considered the gold standard mea -\\nsurement of airflow obstruction [ 36]. However, \\nFEV1 may not always correlate with symptoms, \\nas some evidence suggests that FEV1 can be nor -\\nmal in symptomatic children with poorly con -\\ntrolled asthma [ 37–40], and these types of \\nasthmatics may show no acute response to bron -\\nchodilator [ 41]. In children with normal pre- and \\npost-bronchodilator FEV1, some propose that \\nFEF 25–75% might better correlate with bronchodi -\\nlator responsiveness [ 42]. Perez et  al. showed that \\nin adults with moderate-to-severe asthma without \\nsignificant proximal airway obstruction (normal \\nFEV1 and FEV1/FVC), treated with ICS and \\nLABA, evidence of small-airway impairment \\ncould be found in more than half of the patients. \\nIn addition, they pointed out that routinely used \\nlung function tests, including FEV1 and FEV1/\\nFVC, can underestimate small-airway obstruc -\\ntion [ 43]. In heterogeneous populations, FEF 25–75 \\n(forced expiratory flow at 25–75% of forced vital \\ncapacity) showed no superiority in clinical \\ndecision-  making when compared with FEV1, \\nFVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio [ 44]. But, in asth -\\nmatic children with normal FEV1, reduced \\nFEF 25–75 had been associated with increased \\nasthma severity, need for systemic corticoste -\\nroids, and more frequent exacerbations [ 45]. In \\nasthmatic adults, reduction in FEF 25–75 could \\nW. Li and M.C.

In another pediat -\\nric study, FEF 75 (forced expiratory flow at 75% of \\nforced vital capacity) was shown to be more sen -\\nsitive than FEV1 and more sensitive in measuring \\nsmall-airway obstruction as compared to FEF 25–75 \\nand FEF 50 (forced expiratory flow at 50% of \\nforced vital capacity) and might be another \\nparameter worthy of consideration in the clinical \\nmanagement of childhood asthma [ 48].\\nPulmonary function testing is an essential \\nbiomarker for the diagnosis and management \\nof asthma. The FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio are \\nrecommended as “gold standard” measure -\\nments for diagnosis of obstructive lung disease \\nby the National Lung Health Education \\nProgram (NLHEP), the National Heart Lung \\nand Blood Institute (NHLBI), and the World \\nHealth Organization (WHO) [ 49]. Other spiro -\\nmetric parameters that measure small-airway \\nobstruction have the potential to play a unique \\nrole in the diagnosis and management of cer -\\ntain phenotypes of asthma. Further study is \\nneeded to delineate the utility of these spiro -\\nmetric parameters as potential biomarkers of \\nsevere asthma.\\n4.2  Exhaled Breath Including \\nFeNO\\n4.2.1   FeNO\\nFractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is a non-\\ninvasive biomarker of allergic airway inflamma -\\ntion that is increasingly utilized in clinical \\npractice. FeNO measurement is a simple and \\nwell-tolerated procedure that is easily obtainable \\neven in children and in patients with severe air -\\nway obstruction. The utility of FeNO in the assessment of airway inflammation and the mon -\\nitoring of responsiveness to ICS therapy is the \\nsubject of ongoing clinical studies.\\nNitric oxide (NO) is a biological mediator in \\nmammals, and it is produced by nitric oxide syn -\\nthase (NOS) in a variety of cell types [ 50, 51]. \\nNO plays multiple roles in asthma pathogenesis \\n[52–55]. In response to pro-inflammatory stim -\\nuli, NOS levels are upregulated, resulting in \\nincreased NO production in lung tissue and in \\nexhaled breath [ 56–59]. Thus, exhaled NO is \\nregarded as an indirect marker for upregulation \\nof allergic airway inflammation. In the 1990s, \\npatients with asthma were found to have high \\nFeNO in their exhaled breath [ 60–63], and FeNO \\nlevels in these patients were noted to decrease in \\nresponse to treatment with corticosteroids [ 64]. \\nIn both pediatric and adult asthmatics, FeNO lev -\\nels were found to correlate with eosinophilia in \\nsputum [ 65, 66], bronchoalveolar lavage fluid \\n[58, 67], and bronchial biopsies [ 60, 61]. \\nIncreased FeNO levels also correlated with the \\ndegree of eosinophilic airway inflammation in \\nallergen-induced asthma exacerbations [ 68]. In \\naddition, elevated FeNO levels have been corre -\\nlated with several clinical markers of asthma con -\\ntrol, including bronchodilator reversibility, \\nβ-agonist use, nocturnal symptoms [ 69], and the \\nuse of ICS [ 70].\\nMeasurement of FeNO is widely used in the \\nassessment of eosinophilic airway inflammation \\nin asthma, and it is used to help predict the effec -\\ntiveness of corticosteroid treatment [ 71]. \\nAccording to WHO and ATS clinical practice \\nguidelines, FeNO levels appear to be associated \\nwith eosinophilic airway inflammation; however, \\nan increased FeNO can only provide supportive \\nrather than conclusive evidence for an asthma \\ndiagnosis. Nonetheless, FeNO continues to be an \\nattractive noninvasive outcome marker of eosino -\\nphilic airway inflammation in a variety of asthma \\nclinical studies.\\nIncreased FeNO may serve as a strong risk \\nfactor for new-onset asthma in children [ 72, 73], \\nas it was associated with increased airway \\nresponsiveness [ 72] and increased likelihood for \\nnewly diagnosed asthma in this population [ 72, \\n73]. Among children, Chien et  al. found that \\n4 Biomarkers in  Severe Asthma', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 64}),\n"," Document(page_content='62\\nserum IL-17 and FeNO levels were significantly \\nhigher in mild-to-severe persistent asthmatics as \\ncompared to intermittent asthmatics or healthy \\ncontrols ( P < 0.05) [ 74]. Among elderly asthmat -\\nics, Kawamatawong et  al. found that neither high \\ntotal IgE, high FeNO, nor atopic status was asso -\\nciated with an increased risk of uncontrolled \\nasthma [ 75]. They suggested that because of the \\nheterogeneity of asthma, particularly severe \\nasthma, Th2-mediated inflammation might not \\nbe the sole influence on asthma severity, espe -\\ncially in an elderly subpopulation [ 75]. Dweik \\net al. also found that FeNO levels are similar in \\nadult patients with severe and non-severe asthma, \\nbut elevated FeNO levels may help to identify \\npatients with more severe asthma phenotypes, \\nincluding those with higher airway reactivity, \\ngreater airflow limitation, and more ICU admis -\\nsions [ 76]. Amelink et  al. identified a distinct \\nsevere adult-onset asthma phenotype (66% non -\\natopic), in which high FeNO levels and sputum \\neosinophils were associated with asthma severity, \\nindicating this phenotype is nonatopic with per -\\nsistent eosinophilic airway inflammation [ 77].\\nAccording to the WHO asthma clinical prac -\\ntice guidelines, severe uncontrolled asthma is \\ncomprised of three groups [ 78]: untreated severe \\nasthma, difficult-to-treat severe asthma, and \\ntreatment-resistant severe asthma. Among them, \\ndifficult-to-treat severe asthma could be con -\\ntrolled with combined ICS/LABA asthma medi -\\ncations, while treatment-resistant severe asthma \\nmay need other treatment strategies, including \\ntargeted biologic therapies [ 78, 79]. Many studies \\nhave attempted to identify asthma phenotypes by \\nFeNO levels. Some studies suggest that patients \\nwith treatment-resistant severe asthma have \\nhigher baseline FeNO levels than those with \\ndifficult-  to-treat severe asthma [ 80, 81]. In con -\\ntrast, others show no difference in FeNO levels \\nbetween these two groups [ 82]. De Andrade et  al. \\nproposed that FeNO levels and spirometry are \\nhelpful to distinguish between treatment-  resistant \\nand difficult-to-treat severe asthma prior to any \\nintervention [ 80]. In severe refractory asthma, \\nFeNO levels were higher in patients with an \\neosinophilic phenotype compared to those with a \\nnon-eosinophilic phenotype [ 83]. Tseliou et  al. showed that in severe refractory asthma, FeNO \\nthreshold values distinguish those with predomi -\\nnant eosinophilia from those with neutrophilia \\nand that FeNO levels were reduced in patients \\nwith predominant neutrophilia regardless of the \\nconcomitant presence of eosinophilia [ 84].\\nFeNO levels may serve as a predictor of loss \\nof asthma control [ 85, 86] and as a risk for exac -\\nerbations [ 86, 87]. However, FeNO is not cur -\\nrently recommended as a tool to guide therapy in \\nthe management of asthma [ 22]. In children with \\nasthma, FeNO levels were shown to change prior \\nto moderate exacerbations [ 88]. One report sug -\\ngests that monitoring of FeNO level may prevent \\nthe progression of the remodeling associated \\nwith refractory/severe asthma [ 89]. However, \\nother studies report that FeNO-guided manage -\\nment provides no benefit to asthma control [ 90, \\n91]. One study that took atopy into account while \\nusing FeNO to guide management of asthma \\nreported a reduction in the number of children \\nwith severe exacerbations, although this reduc -\\ntion may have been related to increased ICS use. \\nSimilarly, Peirsman et  al. found that FeNO mea -\\nsurement may lead to diminished rates of asthma \\nexacerbations when used to guide treatment \\nthrough increased use of leukotriene receptor \\nantagonists and increased ICS doses [ 92]. \\nNonetheless, it remains to be seen if FeNO-  \\nguided therapy is clearly beneficial for improving \\nasthma control [ 93]. In adult patients, many stud -\\nies show that FeNO is no better than pulmonary \\nfunction testing as a predictor of asthma control \\n[87, 94, 95]. Calhoun et  al. found that biomarker-  \\nbased or symptom-based adjustment of ICS was \\nnot superior to physician assessment-based \\nadjustment of inhaled corticosteroids in measur -\\ning time to treatment failure [ 96]. Two large \\nmeta-analyses regarding FeNO-guided manage -\\nment drew different conclusions. Petsky et  al. \\nsuggested that tailoring of asthma treatment \\nbased on FeNO levels failed to improve asthma \\noutcomes in children and adults [ 97]. While Essat \\net al. found that while FeNO-guided management \\nshowed no statistically significant benefit in \\nreducing severe asthma exacerbations or ICS use, \\nit did produce a statistically significant reduction \\nin asthma exacerbations of any severity [ 98]. \\nW.

Gibson et  al. suggested that FeNO-  \\nguided management may not be suitable to main -\\ntain control in all asthmatic patients, but it may \\nbe useful in a select asthmatic population [ 100].\\nOne of the most valuable clinical aspects of \\nFeNO is the potential to differentiate patients \\nwith asthma-like symptoms from asthmatics \\nmost likely to benefit from ICS.  In corticosteroid-  \\nresponsive asthmatics, elevated FeNO levels \\ndecrease quickly after treatment with ICS [ 101, \\n102]. FeNO levels are affected by many factors \\nincluding infection and smoking status. Despite \\nthis, measurement of FeNO tends to be highly \\nreproducible in an individual with or without \\nasthma [ 103–107], so sequential measurements \\nmay be important in determining trends. The \\nrapid decrease in FeNO levels in response to ICS \\nadds to its utility in monitoring adherence and \\nresponse to therapy [ 108].\\nIn recent years, the introduction of targeted \\nbiologic therapies for the treatment of asthma has \\npeaked interest in finding noninvasive biomark -\\ners of airway inflammation that might help guide \\ntreatment decisions. FeNO has been examined as \\na potential predictor of the effectiveness of anti-  \\nIgE (omalizumab) and anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-13 \\ntreatment. Hanania et  al. showed that after \\n48 weeks of anti-IgE treatment, reductions in \\nexacerbation rates were greater in subjects with \\nelevated FeNO levels, indicating that these \\npatients may achieve greater benefit from omali -\\nzumab [ 109]. Sorkness et  al. found that FeNO \\nlevel, along with blood eosinophil count and \\nbody mass index, can predict omalizumab \\nresponse [ 110]. Moreover, elevated FeNO levels \\nmay be indicative of a positive response to anti-  \\nIL- 13/IL-4 [ 111, 112].\\nIn 2005, the ATS and the European Respiratory \\nSociety (ERS) published “Recommendations for Standardized Procedures for the Online and \\nOffline Measurement of Exhaled Lower \\nRespiratory Nitric Oxide and Nasal Nitric Oxide” \\n[113]. This publication provided standardized \\nrecommendations for the measurement of FeNO \\nas well as online and offline NO measurement, so \\nthat online measurements can be standardized for \\ntesting at multiple sites. These guidelines also \\nsuggested that FeNO should be expressed in parts \\nper billion (ppb), as compared to nanoliters per \\nliter [ 113].\\nSeveral studies demonstrate that there is con -\\nsiderable overlap between FeNO levels in healthy \\nsubjects and asthmatics [ 71, 114, 115]. In gen -\\neral, FeNO levels can be affected by several fac -\\ntors, including genetics, age (especially in \\nchildren), sex, atopy, weight, height, smoking \\nstatus, and a nitrate-rich diet [ 114, 116–125]. \\nMany technical factors can also affect FeNO \\nmeasurement, such as technique, exhalation flow \\nrate, nasal NO contamination, the type of NO \\nanalyzer used [ 101], and anti-inflammatory med -\\nications. As a result, ATS guidelines in 2011 rec -\\nommended specific cutoff points in patients with \\nairway disease or respiratory symptoms instead \\nof reference values derived from a “normal” pop -\\nulation [ 71].

The format of the \\nreporting should include the device used to make \\nthe measurement, the number of measurements \\nmade, and the flow rate (current FDA-approved \\ndevices use 50  ml/s flow rate) [ 71].\\nDue to multiple confounding factors that \\npotentially influence FeNO measurement, the \\ninterpretation of FeNO levels should always be \\nconsidered within the clinical context in which \\nthe measurement is being obtained [ 71].

A symptomatic patient with low FeNO lev -\\nels may suggest the presence of non-eosinophilic \\ninflammation, neutrophilic asthma, cystic fibro -\\nsis, or nonpulmonary comorbid conditions such \\nas GERD, cardiac disease, or laryngospasm. Low \\nFeNO levels in an asymptomatic asthma patient \\nmay reflect appropriate dose and adherence ICS \\ntherapy. FeNO greater than 50  ppb (>35  ppb in \\nchildren) in symptomatic patients may indicate \\neosinophilic airway inflammation resulting from \\natopic asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis, ACOS, or \\ninadequate ICS dosing. In asymptomatic asth -\\nmatic patients, high levels of FeNO may indicate \\nthat caution be exercised with ICS dose reduc -\\ntion.

As a biomarker, the utility of \\nFeNO has been examined in predicting asthma \\nonset, grading asthma severity, and monitoring \\nresponsiveness to ICS and biological therapies. \\nHowever there still remain many unanswered \\nquestions as to the applicability of FeNO in other \\nasthma phenotypes, and further study is needed \\nto confirm a beneficial role in the management of \\nsevere asthma.\\n4.2.2   Exhaled Breath Condensate \\n(EBC)\\nAccording to ATS/ERS guidelines, exhaled \\nbreath condensate (EBC) is strictly defined as \\nexhaled samples collected by cooling the exhaled \\nbreath [ 127]. EBC contains mainly condensed \\nwater vapor (>99%) [ 128, 129], and a small frac -\\ntion of the sample contains nonvolatile com -\\npounds. Those nonvolatile molecules include \\nmarkers of oxidative stress (e.g., H2O2, \\n8- isoprostane, aldehydes, nitrite, and nitrate), markers of inflammation (e.g., prostanoids, leu -\\nkotriene, and epoxides), cytokines (including \\nTh2 cytokines), and many other biomarkers. All \\nof the biomarkers noted above can be hydrophilic \\nor hydrophobic [ 130]. These biomarkers may \\nplay an important role in aiding the understand -\\ning of asthma pathogenesis, diagnosis, manage -\\nment, and identification of new therapeutic \\ntargets.\\nATS/ERS guidelines made many recommen -\\ndations on the preferred methodology for EBC \\ncollection. During the EBC sampling process, the \\npatient should be in the sitting position wearing a \\nnoseclip during normal tidal breathing. Collection \\ntime and temperature can vary depending on the \\nstudy objective, but these parameters should be \\nkept the same within any one study and should be \\nprecisely reported. The condensing device should \\nincorporate certain essential components includ -\\ning an inert material on the collecting surface, a \\nsufficient salivary trap, a mouth piece with sepa -\\nrated inlet (as an inhalation port) and outlet (to \\ndirect exhaled breath toward the condensing \\napparatus), and a low-resistance flow path (with -\\nout a filter) between the subject and the condens -\\ning chamber [ 127].\\nThe EBC measurement can be affected by \\nmany factors, so the report should contain \\ndetailed methodology for sample collection \\nincluding a description of the sampling device, \\nthe collecting surface material, the volume of \\nthe dead space (if possible), the duration and \\ntemperature of collection, breathing pattern, use \\nof noseclip, route of inhalation, method, and \\nduration of sample storage. Additionally, intra-\\nassay and inter-assay variability of the tech -\\nnique and intra-subject variability should be \\nreported. Lastly, details of subjects should con -\\ntain information related to upper airway disease, \\nsmoking status, and medication history [ 127].\\nImmediately after collection, EBC samples \\nshould be frozen and stored at −70 °C. Samples \\nshould be stored in aliquots to avoid multiple \\nfreeze/thaw cycles. Every potential mediator pos -\\nsesses unique physiochemical characteristics, so \\nmeasurement techniques will vary based on the \\nmediator studied.\\nW. Li and M.C.

Many \\nstudies suggest that EBT is elevated in uncon -\\ntrolled asthmatics as compared to well-controlled \\nasthmatics and healthy controls [ 131–133], espe -\\ncially during exacerbations [ 131]. Several studies \\nshowed that elevated EBT levels correlated to \\nFeNO levels [ 134, 135] and sputum eosinophils \\n[134]. Piacentini et  al. found that elevated EBT \\nrelated to MMP-9 levels [ 136]. This suggested \\nthat EBT may act as a marker of airway remodel -\\ning. However, other studies suggest that EBT is \\nunrelated to FeNO levels [ 137, 138] or sputum \\neosinophil counts and therefore that EBT cannot \\nbe recommended as a reliable biomarker in the \\ndiagnosis and management of asthma [ 137–139]. \\nNonetheless, EBT is a simple, noninvasive, and \\nconsistently reproducible physiologic parameter \\n[138, 140, 141]. Conflicting results related to the \\nutility of EBT as an asthma biomarker may be \\ndue to varying experimental designs and lack of \\nstandardization. As such, further research is war -\\nranted to explore the utility of EBT measure -\\nments in asthma management.\\n4.2.4   pH\\nThe acidity (pH) of EBC is thought to reflect air -\\nway acidification and thus may serve as a surro -\\ngate marker of airway acid-base status. EBC pH \\ncan be measured by commercial devices or \\nhomemade equipment [ 142]. The mean pH of \\nhealthy subjects is 7.7, with a normal range of \\n7.4–8.8 [ 143]. However, the detection and utility \\nof EBC pH in the management of asthma remain \\ncontroversial. According to ATS/ERS guidelines, \\ndeaeration (gas standardization) with a CO 2 free \\ngas (e.g., argon) can be performed to improve the \\nstability of pH values [ 127]. But Effros et  al. sug -\\ngested that EBC pH could be influenced by many \\nfactors including buffer capacities, dilution, and \\nsalivary contamination and that deaeration with \\nargon is insufficient and unnecessary [ 144]. Some studies showed that pH values decrease \\nsignificantly in asthma patients, especially during \\nexacerbations [ 145–147], while others showed \\nno differences between asthma patients and \\nhealthy subjects [ 148, 149]. Leung et  al. sug -\\ngested that EBC pH values could be influenced \\nby severity of asthma [ 150], but Liu et  al. found \\nno significant differences between the EBC pH \\nvalues of severe asthma, non-severe asthma, and \\ncontrol subjects [ 149]. Most studies suggested \\nthat EBC pH levels were unaffected by either ICS \\nor systemic corticosteroids [ 147–149, 151, 152], \\nwhile Hunt et  al. and Antus et  al. found that EBC \\npH values increased after corticosteroid therapy \\n[145, 146]. EBC pH appears to have no relation -\\nship with other clinical variables such as FEV1 \\nand symptoms scores. Studies evaluating the \\nrelationship between EBC pH and other biomark -\\ners, such as FeNO, are also conflicting. Tomasiak-  \\nLozowska et  al. suggested that EBC pH values \\nand FeNO are inversely correlated [ 153], while \\nother groups found they are not correlated [ 146, \\n148, 150]. Studies evaluating relationships \\nbetween EBC pH and 8-isoprostane showed sim -\\nilar conflicting results [ 150, 154]. Some groups \\nproposed that a specific profile of airway bio -\\nmarkers might help predict a particular pattern of \\nairway inflammation. This profile of airway bio -\\nmarkers typically combined EBC pH and other \\nairway biomarkers to predict airway inflamma -\\ntion [ 153] and to diagnose childhood asthma \\n[151]. In 2014, a larger study including 110 asth -\\nmatic children found serial EBC pH measure -\\nments had limited utility in the differential \\ndiagnosis, evaluation, and management of \\nasthma. As a result, these authors recommended \\nagainst using EBC pH as a biomarker in the long-  \\nterm assessment of childhood asthma [ 147].\\n4.2.5   Biomarkers of  Oxidative \\nStress\\n4.2.5.1   H2O2\\nIn asthma, there is elevated airway expression of \\nproducts of oxidative stress.

H 2O2 is generated from mul -\\ntiple cellular sources including neutrophils and \\neosinophils [ 155, 156]. In both adult and pediat -\\nric asthmatics, EBC levels of H 2O2 are signifi -\\ncantly higher than that of healthy controls \\n[157–163] regardless of asthma severity [ 160, \\n161]. During acute exacerbations, EBC H 2O2 \\nlevels are significantly elevated [ 162]. While one \\ngroup reported no association of EBC H 2O2 lev-\\nels with asthma exacerbations, the authors con -\\nceded that the discrepancy in their data may have \\nto do with issues related to sample collection, \\nstorage, and analysis [ 164]. H 2O2 is often used in \\ncombination with other biomarkers making \\ninterpretation more complex. Several studies \\nsuggested that EBC H 2O2 levels were negatively \\ncorrelated with lung function, especially FEV1% \\n[158–161]. Two groups showed no correlation \\nbetween EBC H 2O2 and lung function [ 163, \\n165]. Conflicting results were also found when \\ncomparing EBC H 2O2 levels with other clinical \\nvariables such as symptom scores and ACT \\nscores, with two studies showing a positive cor -\\nrelation [ 160, 165] and one showing no correla -\\ntion [ 163]. In two studies, FeNO appeared to be \\nuncorrelated with EBC H 2O2 levels [ 158, 165]. \\nThere is also conflicting data as to whether EBC \\nH2O2 levels reflect clinical response to cortico -\\nsteroid treatment in asthmatics. Jöbsis et  al. \\nfound that ICS-  naïve patients have significantly \\nhigher level of H 2O2 than healthy controls, while \\nICS-treated patients do not [ 157]. In contrast, \\nTrischler et  al. found that there was no difference \\nin EBC H 2O2 levels between ICS-naïve and ICS-\\ntreated patients, as both groups had significantly \\nhigher EBC H 2O2 levels than controls [ 165]. \\nWhile Al Obaidi et  al. suggested that after \\n4 weeks of ICS and salbutamol treatment, poorly \\ncontrolled patients still had significantly higher \\nlevels of EBC H 2O2 than stable asthmatics. As a \\nresult, the authors recommended that EBC H 2O2 \\nlevels might act as a predictor of non-response to steroid treatment [ 166]. Teng et  al. did a meta-  \\nanalysis about EBC H 2O2’s role in the assess -\\nment of disease severity, disease control, and \\nresponse to corticosteroid treatment. They sug -\\ngested that EBC H 2O2 levels could be a promis -\\ning biomarker in guiding asthma treatment \\n[167]. Other authors differed, with Caffarelli \\net al. and Trischler et  al. both suggesting that \\nEBC H 2O2 levels might not predict the occur -\\nrence of exacerbations [ 162, 168].\\n4.2.5.2   8-Isoprostane\\n8-Isoprostane is a prostaglandin (PG)-F2-like \\ncompound belonging to the class of F2 iso -\\nprostanes, and it is produced by free radical-\\ncatalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid \\n[169].

The relationship between Cys-  LTs \\nand 8-isoprostane is controversial. Some stud -\\nies showed no correlation [ 173, 180], while \\nothers showed significant correlation [ 174, \\n176, 181].\\n8-Isoprostane levels appear to be resistant or \\npartially resistant to the effects of ICS or oral cor -\\nticosteroids [ 171, 174, 183].

Cys-LTs can increase airway \\nsmooth muscle contraction, vascular permeabil -\\nity, and mucus secretion, and they inhibit muco -\\nciliary clearance [ 196, 199, 203].

Measurement of VOCs have \\nbeen examined as a biomarker to indicate the \\npresence of asthma [ 242, 243], and several stud -\\nies have suggested a role for exhaled VOC \\nassessment as a tool to predict asthma severity \\n[241, 244–246].\\nAlthough EBC appears promising as a nonin -\\nvasive diagnostic tool for assessment of airway \\ninflammation, lack of standardized methodology \\nand validated measurement techniques limit the \\ncurrent utility of EBC biomarkers in the assess -\\nment and management of asthma.\\n4.3  Blood\\n4.3.1   IgE\\nIgE mediates type I hypersensitivity reactions. \\nAfter binding to high-affinity Fc εR1 receptors on \\nmast cells and basophils, cross-linking of IgE on \\nthe cell surface results in degranulation and \\nimmediate release of preformed mediators and de \\nnovo synthesis of non-preformed mediators \\nincluding interleukins, cysteinyl leukotrienes, \\nand chemokines. These mediators act locally to \\nrecruit and activate eosinophils and other leuko -\\ncytes leading to chronic airway inflammation. \\nTotal IgE and allergen-specific IgE are blood-  \\nderived biomarkers of atopic status. The presence \\nof allergen-specific IgE is a defining characteris -\\ntic of the atopic asthma phenotype [ 247, 248], \\nand high levels of total IgE suggest an increased \\nrisk of asthma [ 249].\\nOmalizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti -\\nbody that binds free IgE.

Blood \\neosinophil counts are correlated with asthma \\nseverity, increased risk for exacerbations, and \\nworsened outcomes [ 254–257]. Peripheral blood \\neosinophil counts positively correlate with symp -\\ntom scores [ 257] and airway hyperresponsive -\\nness [ 258] but correlate negatively with FEV1 \\n[257]. High blood eosinophil counts predict \\nresponsiveness to systemic corticosteroids [ 259, \\n260], anti-IL-5 therapy [ 261–266], and anti-IgE \\ntherapy [ 109, 267]. In many cases, blood eosino -\\nphil levels decrease in response to afore named \\ntreatments [ 261, 262, 264–266, 268, 269].\\nEosinophils reside mainly in tissue, but when \\nelevated in the blood, their presence may reflect \\ngeneralized allergic inflammation. The definition \\nof high blood eosinophils remains controversial; \\nhowever, most studies define a high eosinophil \\ncount as ranging from >150 to >400  cells/ml. \\nFactors affecting blood eosinophil counts can \\ninclude allergen exposure, parasitic infections, \\nand current systemic glucocorticoid therapy. \\nDespite these potentially confounding factors, \\neosinophil counts do predict therapeutic response \\nto several biologic treatments used for asthma, \\nand as such, blood eosinophil counts likely serve \\nas a surrogate biomarker of eosinophilic airway \\ninflammation [ 270].\\n4.3.3   Periostin\\nPeriostin is an extracellular matrix protein \\nsecreted by airway epithelial cells and lung fibro -\\nblasts largely in response to IL-4 and IL-13 [ 271–\\n275]. Periostin mediates collagen synthesis and \\nfibrinogenesis and activates transforming growth \\nfactor-beta (TGF- β) [272] and contributes to sub -\\nepithelial thickening of the airways [ 271]. In \\naddition, periostin may accelerate eosinophil \\nmigration and infiltration into the tissue [ 276]. \\nPeriostin is also considered as an important struc -\\ntural mediator in mesenchymal remodeling, and it plays a key role in balancing tissue adaption in \\nresponse to insult/injury [ 277].\\nJia et  al. in the BOBCAT study (Bronchoscopic \\nExploratory Research Study of Biomarkers in \\nCorticosteroid-Refractory Asthma) identified \\nserum periostin as the best systemic biomarker of \\nairway eosinophilia in severe, uncontrolled \\nasthma. In this study, periostin was superior to \\nblood eosinophils, IgE levels, YKL-40, and FeNO \\nin predicting severe asthma. The authors sug -\\ngested that periostin would be a preferred bio -\\nmarker to use in patient selection for asthma \\ntherapeutics targeting Th2 inflammation [ 278]. \\nHigher serum periostin levels were found to be an \\nindependent predictor for development of airflow \\nlimitation in asthmatic patients on ICS [ 279] and \\nto be a good predictor of increased risk for asthma \\nexacerbations [ 280]. Woodruff et  al. found that \\nhigh baseline expression of periostin was associ -\\nated with an optimal clinical response to cortico -\\nsteroids and that expression of periostin was \\nsteroid-responsive [ 273]. Lebrikizumab is a \\nmonoclonal antibody that blocks activity of IL-13. \\nIn studies examining the effectiveness of lebriki -\\nzumab in treating moderate-to-severe uncon -\\ntrolled asthmatics, those with high baseline serum \\nperiostin levels demonstrated a greater improve -\\nment in the rate of asthma exacerbations and \\nFEV1 compared with those with low serum peri -\\nostin levels [ 280, 281]. Serum periostin may also \\npredict the response to omalizumab treatment. In \\na study examining use of biomarkers in the \\nEXTRA study (A Study of Omalizumab in \\nSubjects with Moderate to Severe Persistent \\nAsthma), subjects treated with omalizumab with \\nhigh baseline levels of periostin demonstrated a \\ngreater reduction in exacerbation rates as com -\\npared to subjects with low serum periostin [ 109]. \\nAs compared to other potential serum-derived \\nbiomarkers for asthma, serum periostin possesses \\ntwo major advantages. First, serum measurement \\nof periostin seems to closely reflect local periostin \\nlevels in the tissues [ 282, 283], and second, serum \\nperiostin basal levels are readily detectable, thus \\nproviding a baseline reference point to compare \\nrelative changes in expression [ 284].\\nPeriostin levels have also been examined in \\nsputum and EBC [ 285, 286].

In particular, efforts to establish \\ncutoffs for high and low values will be important \\nin establishing the utility of this biomarker in \\ndefining asthma phenotypes and selecting \\npatients for emerging biologic therapies.\\n4.3.4   Other Biomarkers\\nPatil et  al. measured serum levels of cytokines, \\nchemokines, growth factors, adhesion molecules, \\nand cytokine receptors in chronic asthmatics and \\nanalyzed their association with asthma control and \\nquality of life. Results demonstrated that many \\ncytokines and growth factors (excluding IFN- γ) \\nwere expressed at significantly higher levels in \\nasthmatics as compared to non-asthmatic controls. \\nParticularly, IL-3, IL-18, fibroblast growth factor, \\nhepatocyte growth factor, and stem cell growth \\nfactor- β levels were elevated significantly in \\npoorly controlled asthmatics as compared to those \\nthat were well controlled [ 287]. In another study, \\nRANTES, a key chemotactic factor in allergic air -\\nway inflammation, was significantly increased in \\npatients with severe asthma, and increased \\nRANTES levels were positively associated with \\neosinophil count and total serum IgE level but \\nnegatively correlated to FEV1[ 288]. Recently, \\nChambers et  al. found the existence of IL-17Ahigh \\nand IFN- γhigh immunophenotypes in patients with \\ncorticosteroid-resistant asthma [ 289]. Ciprandi \\net al. showed that serum levels of IL-23 were \\nincreased among asthmatic children and nega -\\ntively correlated with pulmonary function [ 290].\\nGalectins are a family of animal lectins with \\nvariable cellular and extracellular localization \\naffecting a variety of cellular processes and bio -\\nlogical activities. Of these, galectin-9 and galec -\\ntin- 3 were found to be relevant to asthma. \\nGalectin-9 promotes recruitment of eosinophils and promotes Th2 dominance [ 291], but galectin-\\n 9 also binds IgE, thus promoting antiallergic \\neffects and may prevent acute asthma exacerba -\\ntions [ 292, 293]. Galectin-3 promotes multiple \\ncellular activities including adhesion, growth, \\nchemoattraction, differentiation, apoptosis, and \\ncell cycle regulation. Galectin 3 may also have \\nIgE binding activities [ 294–296]. Mauri et  al. \\nsuggested that galectin-3 could be considered as \\na reliable biomarker to predict response to omali -\\nzumab therapy in severe asthmatics [ 297].\\nOther serum markers have been found to be \\nelevated in the blood of asthmatics. These mark -\\ners include C3 and C4 complement [ 298], \\nchitinase-  like proteinYKL-40 [ 299, 300] and \\nOX40, and its ligands [ 301]. Serum leptin levels \\nand body mass index have also been associated \\nwith the severity of airway inflammation in child -\\nhood asthma [ 302].\\nIn recent years, research has focused on new \\navenues of exploration including proteomics, \\ngenomics, and metabolomics in an attempt to \\nidentify relevant biomarkers in severe asthma. The \\ngoal of identifying new biomarkers is to help \\nimprove the diagnosis, phenotyping, and manage -\\nment of this chronic and sometimes debilitating \\ndisease. Among these biomarkers, attractive can -\\ndidates include C7 complement protein, alpha-\\n1-antitrypsin [ 303], gamma fibrinogen and its \\nisoforms, C3 complement fragments [ 304], fibro -\\nnectin [ 305], arginase, and syntaxin [ 306]. In addi -\\ntion, Verrills et  al. identified another series of \\ncandidate biomarkers that includes a panel of four \\nacute-phase proteins (ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, \\nhemopexin, and α2-macroglobulin) that may be \\nable to discriminate among asthma, COPD, and \\nnormal controls [ 307]. However, further investiga -\\ntion is needed to clarify the relevance of these sys -\\ntemic biomarkers in various aspects of asthma.\\n4.4  Bronchial Specimens\\n4.4.1   Biomarkers in  Induced \\nSputum\\nInduced sputum is a noninvasive and feasible pro -\\ncedure to perform in asthmatic adults and most \\nW.

This technique is much less inva -\\nsive than bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar \\nlavage (BAL) or bronchial brush/biopsy. Induced \\nsputum is usually performed by inhalation of \\nhypertonic saline in increasing concentrations \\n(3%, 4% and 5%) via ultrasonic nebulizer. Prior to \\nthe procedure, a baseline FEV1 is performed then \\nrepeated after inhalation of each concentration of \\nsaline. If the FEV1 decreases by 15%, after inha -\\nlation of any of the saline concentrations, the pro -\\ncedure is halted [ 309]. Investigators have \\nemployed a variety of techniques to improve the \\nquality of sputum samples and their staining char -\\nacteristics [ 310–315]. Induced sputum consists of \\nthe cell phase (e.g., eosinophils and neutrophils) \\nand the supernatant (e.g., cytokines and chemo -\\nkines). Both phases can be used for diagnosis, \\nphenotyping, and classification of asthma and for \\npredicting exacerbations.\\n4.4.2   Sputum Eosinophil \\nand  Neutrophil Counts\\nBecause asthma is a heterogeneous disease, a \\nvariety of inflammatory cell types can be recov -\\nered from the airways. Profiles of the inflamma -\\ntory cellular infiltrate obtained by induced \\nsputum, biopsies, and BAL can be categorized as \\npauci-granulocytic, eosinophilic, neutrophilic, \\nand mixed [ 316, 317].\\nSputum eosinophils are expressed as a per -\\ncentage of inflammatory cells [ 318]. Based on \\nreference values from healthy individuals, spu -\\ntum eosinophilia is defined as an eosinophil per -\\ncentage ≥3% [ 252, 313]. Elevated sputum \\neosinophil counts can be associated with gender \\n(females  > males) and atopy. [ 319]. In asthmatic \\npatients, sputum eosinophil counts were signifi -\\ncantly higher compared to those from healthy \\nsubjects. Sputum eosinophilia was associated \\nwith airway hyperresponsiveness [ 320], airway \\nobstruction [ 321], and severe exacerbations [ 320, \\n322, 323] and inversely correlated with FEV1 \\n[324]. In addition, sputum eosinophil counts are \\nelevated following allergen challenge [ 312].\\nSputum eosinophils can be used to gauge \\nresponse to therapy. In several studies, sputum eosinophilia could predict a favorable response to \\nglucocorticoid treatment [ 325–327]. Sputum \\neosinophil counts are reduced by both ICS and \\nsystemic corticosteroid treatment [ 328, 329], \\nwhile withdrawal of glucocorticoid therapy leads \\nto a rapid increase in the number of sputum \\neosinophils [ 321]. In asthmatics receiving ICS \\ntherapy, an increase in sputum eosinophils may \\nbe predictive of an asthma exacerbation [ 323, \\n330, 331]. Wenzel et  al. found a group of severe \\nasthmatics that demonstrated persistent eosino -\\nphilic inflammation despite corticosteroid treat -\\nment [ 316]. However, in most asthma phenotypes, \\nsputum eosinophil counts still represent a key \\nmarker of steroid responsiveness during asthma \\nexacerbations [ 97].\\nIn addition to predicting clinical response to \\nglucocorticoids, sputum eosinophilia may also \\npredict pharmacologic response to biologic thera -\\npies. In studies examining the effectiveness of \\nIL-5 blockade in asthma, patients with persistent \\nsputum eosinophilia receiving drug demonstrated \\nsignificant reduction in sputum eosinophils, \\ndecreased exacerbations, and improved lung func -\\ntion [ 263, 265, 266]. In contrast, asthmatics treated \\nwith mepolizumab not pre-selected for elevated \\nsputum eosinophils showed little to no benefit in \\nmultiple measures of asthma control [ 332].\\nNeutrophils also play an important role in air -\\nway inflammation, particularly in certain asthma \\nphenotypes. Moore et  al. found that sputum neu -\\ntrophilia, either alone or with concurrent sputum \\neosinophilia, was the most common inflamma -\\ntory cell pattern in patient clusters with moderate-  \\nto- severe asthma [ 333]. Similar results \\nsupporting an important role for airway neutro -\\nphils in severe asthma were reported by Wenzel \\net al. using BAL and biopsy specimens [ 334]. \\nSputum neutrophil counts correlated with lung \\nfunction, even in the setting of ICS therapy \\n[324]. In other studies, sputum neutrophil counts \\nwere inversely associated with post-bronchodi -\\nlator FEV1  in asthmatics, suggesting that neu -\\ntrophilic inflammation may contribute to \\npersistent airway obstruction [ 94, 335]. In one \\nstudy, the combination of increased sputum \\neosinophils and neutrophils was found in asth -\\nmatic patients with the lowest lung function, \\n4 Biomarkers in  Severe Asthma', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 74}),\n"," Document(page_content='72\\nworst asthma control, increased symptoms, and \\nhighest healthcare utilization [ 322].\\nIn healthy subjects, neutrophils are the most \\nabundant inflammatory cells in induced sputum \\n[319]. Cigarette smoking, infection, ozone, and \\nendotoxin are all factors that can increase sputum \\nneutrophil counts [ 319]. Established cutoffs for \\ndefining sputum neutrophilia are less clear than \\nthat for sputum eosinophilia, but typical ranges \\nvary from 40% to 76% [ 26, 319, 322, 336]. The \\nmechanism for airway neutrophilia in asthma is \\nnot clear. The use of corticosteroids may contrib -\\nute to neutrophilia by suppressing T2 inflamma -\\ntion, and even Th1 factors may play a role \\n[337–339]. Th17 immunity might also be a cause \\nfor neutrophilia [ 339–342]. Hastie et  al. found \\nthat significant statistical associations exist \\nbetween sputum eosinophil and neutrophil counts \\nand other biomarkers (including blood eosinophil \\ncounts, total serum IgE levels, FeNO values, and \\nFEV1%). However, none of these biomarkers \\ncould predict sputum eosinophil and neutrophil \\nlevels in individual subjects across the spectrum \\nof severe asthma. So, the authors suggest that the \\nassessment of sputum eosinophils and neutro -\\nphils should not be replaced by those other non -\\ninvasive biomarkers for now [ 343]. The collection \\nof sputum cell counts has not been standardized, \\nand the technique of sputum induction and pro -\\ncessing of specimens can be laborious and costly. \\nERS/ATS guidelines from 2014 on the definition, \\nevaluation, and treatment of severe asthma sug -\\ngested that, in adults, treatment should be primar -\\nily guided by clinical criteria and that sputum \\neosinophil counts should only be performed in \\nexperienced centers [ 22]. Measurement of spu -\\ntum eosinophilia is recommended only as a sup -\\nplemental outcome for study population \\ncharacterization, clinical trials, and observational \\nstudies [ 252].\\n4.4.3   Other Biomarkers\\nMany cytokines, chemokines, and bioactive \\nmolecules are found at higher levels in sputum \\nsamples from patients with severe asthma as \\ncompared to non-asthmatic controls. Some of these compounds that show promise as potential \\nbiomarkers include eosinophil cationic proteins \\n(ECP), eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), \\neotaxin, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-13, IL-17, TNF- α, \\nIL-6, IL-12, granulocyte-macrophage colony-  \\nstimulating factor (GMCF), urokinase plasmin -\\nogen activator, plasminogen activator \\ninhibitor-1, purine nucleotides, growth factors, \\nantioxidants, and mucins [ 278, 279, 344–348]. \\nAlso, neurokinin A levels have been shown to \\nbe significantly elevated during acute asthma \\nexacerbations [ 349].\\nIn addition, several important mediators \\nfound in the sputum supernatant of severe asth -\\nmatics are associated with the remodeling pro -\\ncess, and these include pro-collagen synthesis \\npeptides, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), \\ntissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP), \\nand TGF- β [350]. Elevated sputum levels of \\nthese mediators in asthmatic patients are not \\ninfluenced by ICS and may help to explain why \\nICS have no effect on preventing or reversing \\nairway remodeling [ 351].\\nSputum hydrogen sulfide levels have been \\nsuggested as a possible asthma biomarker as lev -\\nels were negatively correlated with FEV1% \\n(reversible with albuterol) and positively associ -\\nated with increased sputum neutrophil counts. \\nSaito et  al. suggested that sputum hydrogen sul -\\nfate levels might serve as a useful biomarker of \\nneutrophilic inflammation and chronic airflow \\nobstruction [ 352].\\nIn addition to cell and bioactive molecules, \\nmany other biomarkers have been measured in \\ninduced sputum. Brickey et  al. used sputum cells \\nto investigate inflammasome-related gene expres -\\nsion [ 353]. Alexis et  al. investigated genetic \\nresponses and cell surface phenotype markers in \\nasthmatic patients following exposure to inhaled \\nirritants and found that phagocytosis was signifi -\\ncantly decreased in sputum macrophages in asth -\\nmatics with high eosinophils as compared to those \\nwith normal eosinophils [ 354, 355]. Loughlin \\net al. measured hydration status of the airways \\nusing the percentage of solid content of sputum \\nand suggested that there was a direct relationship \\nbetween neutrophil inflammation and airway \\nhydration status in stable asthmatics [ 356].\\nW.

Those items detected in sputum \\ncan also be measured in lavage and bronchial \\nwash. Along with bronchial biopsy, these tech -\\nniques can be useful tools to monitor and assess \\nairway inflammation and remodeling [ 357]. \\nSome authors suggest that BAL alone cannot be \\nconsidered as a surrogate for induced sputum, \\nbecause induced sputum (and bronchial wash) \\nsample central bronchial airways [ 358], while \\nBAL mainly recovers cells and mediators from \\ndistal airways.

Despite these limitations, \\nvaluable information regarding the nature of \\nasthmatic airway inflammation has been obtained \\nthrough the use of BAL.  Goleva et  al. recently \\nshowed that a subset of subjects with \\nglucocorticoid-  resistant asthma demonstrates air -\\nway expansion of specific gram-negative bacteria \\nthat trigger growth factor β-activated kinase 1/\\nmitogen-activated protein kinase activation, thus \\npromoting glucocorticoid resistance [ 360]. \\nEsnault et  al. identified 57 genes that were highly \\nexpressed by BAL eosinophils after in  vivo aller -\\ngen challenge. Expression of 41 of these genes \\nhad not been previously described in eosinophils, \\nand each is a potentially new candidate to further \\nstudy the contribution of eosinophils to airway \\nbiology [ 361]. Vargas et  al. identified several cor -\\nticosteroid resistance-related receptors (EGFR, \\nEGR1, ESR2, PGR), transcription factors (MYC, \\nJAK), cytokines (IL-8, IL-6, IL-1B), one chemo -\\nkine (CXCL1), one kinase (SRC), and one cyclo -\\noxygenase (PTGS2) using a protein-protein \\ninteraction network [ 362]. Park et  al. found that the ApoA1 protein level is decreased in the air -\\nways of mild-to-moderate persistent asthmatics \\nas compared to healthy controls. Together with \\nmouse data, they suggested ApoA1 to be a prom -\\nising therapeutic target because of its ability to \\npromote repair of defective epithelium in \\ninflamed airways [ 363].\\n4.5  Others\\nIn addition to exhaled breath, blood, and sputum, \\nurine is another biological by-product that may \\ncontain potential biomarkers important in the \\ninvestigation of airway inflammation. Examples \\nof urine-derived biomarkers include leukotrienes, \\nprostaglandins, eosinophil protein X, bromotyro -\\nsine, and others.\\nLeukotrienes play a central role in the patho -\\ngenesis of allergic asthma [ 199, 202]. Among \\nleukotrienes, leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is the stable \\nend product of LTC4, which is the dominant cys -\\nteinyl leukotriene (Cys-LT) in lung tissue [ 364]. \\nLTE4 is excreted in the urine in measurable \\namounts, so urinary LTE4 is regarded as a marker \\nfor systemic production of Cys-LTs [ 365, 366].\\nUrinary LTE4 levels are increased in asthmatic \\npatients as compared with healthy subjects, and \\nelevated LTE4 levels are associated with disease \\nseverity, exacerbations, and aspirin and allergen \\nchallenges [ 367–369]. In recurrent episodic \\nwheezing children, increased basal levels of LTE4 \\nwere observed only in those who were allergic; \\nhowever, during exacerbations, increased urinary \\nLTE4 levels were found in both atopic and non -\\natopic wheezers [ 370]. One study showed that \\nchildren scored with a positive Asthma Predictive \\nIndex (API) had higher urinary LTE4 levels than \\nthose with negative API [ 371]. Chiu et  al. found \\nthat urinary LTE4 levels appeared to be highly \\nassociated with IgE sensitization and related aller -\\ngic airway diseases after age 2 [ 372]. Aspirin-\\nintolerant asthmatic patients also had significantly \\nhigher urinary LTE4 levels than aspirin-tolerant \\nasthmatics [ 373]. ICS do not appear to alter uri -\\nnary LTE4 excretion [ 374]. Conversely, 5-lipoxy -\\ngenase inhibitors significantly reduce urinary \\nLTE4 levels by blocking Cys-LT metabolism \\n4 Biomarkers in  Severe Asthma', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 76}),\n"," Document(page_content='74\\n[375]. Smoking also affects arachidonic acid \\nmetabolite synthesis in asthmatics, as measured \\nby urinary LTE4 and tetranor PGDM (an abun -\\ndant urinary metabolite reflecting PGD2 biosyn -\\nthesis) [ 376]. In children exposed to second-hand \\ntobacco smoke, elevated urinary LTE4 levels are \\nassociated with susceptibility to severe asthma \\nexacerbations [ 377].\\nProstaglandin (PG) D2 is a major cyclooxy -\\ngenase product released by activated mast cells. \\nAfter antigen challenge, PGD2 can cause bron -\\nchoconstriction and vasodilation in the airways \\nof asthmatic patients [ 378]. PGD2 is unstable and \\nis metabolized to 9 α, 11β-PGF2  in the human \\nlung; then PGF2 is rapidly excreted in the urine \\n[379]. Several studies showed that 9 α, 11β-PGF2 \\nlevels are elevated in children with acute asthma, \\nexercise-induced asthma, and asthmatic patients \\nundergoing allergen or aspirin challenge [ 379, \\n380]. Urinary 9 α, 11β-PGF2 levels were nega -\\ntively correlated with lung function, and high-  \\ndose corticosteroid therapy might reduce 9 α, \\n11β-β concentrations [ 381].\\nEosinophils can release four basic eosinophil \\ngranule proteins, major basic protein, eosinophil \\ncationic protein, eosinophil protein X (EPX), and \\neosinophil peroxidase. Among them, EPX (also \\nknown as eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN)) \\nis the only one that can be accurately measured in \\nurine [ 382]. In childhood asthma, the urinary EPX \\n(uEPX) concentrations are increased in children \\nwith either symptomatic or asymptomatic asthma \\ncompared to controls [ 383]. uEPX levels are ele -\\nvated during exacerbations and correlate with the \\nseverity of attacks in asthmatic children [ 384]. \\nLevels of uEPX are responsive to asthma therapy, \\nas Severien et  al. found that after 3  months of anti-\\ninflammatory treatment, uEPX levels significantly \\ndecreased [ 367].

Chronic inflammation is present in \\nalmost all patients with asthma, even in the air -\\nways of patients with very mild asthma, and \\nincreases with disease severity. Asthma affects \\napproximately 5% of the general adult popula -\\ntion, of whom approximately 5–10% suffer from \\nsevere asthma [ 1].\\nLong-standing severe asthma may be associ -\\nated with structural changes of both the proximal \\nand distal airways. Pulmonary function studies \\nare the main measures used to assess and monitor \\nairway obstruction in asthma. Although the sig -\\nnificance of radiological findings of asthma \\nremains unclear, high-resolution CT (HRCT) \\nscan has identified abnormalities in asthma and \\nhas correlated these abnormalities with clinical \\nand pulmonary function data. In severe asthma, \\nthe applications of HRCT scanning are consider -\\nably broader. This technique has been used to \\nnoninvasively assess airway wall changes in \\npatients with severe asthma. Over the past \\n10 years, HRCT scan has been validated as an \\nappropriate technique for distinguishing patients \\nwith asthma with normal airflow or mild airflow \\nobstruction from healthy subjects [ 2–5].HRCT scan has enabled visualization of air -\\nways and parenchyma in much greater detail than \\nplain radiography. Expected abnormalities were \\nseen in 37.8% of the chest radiographs, while the \\nHRCT scans were abnormal in 71.9% of the \\ncases. Pathologically, the structural changes in \\nsevere asthma comprise bronchiectasis with \\nmucoid impaction, bronchial dilatation, and \\nbronchial wall thickening (Fig.  5.1), although \\nsome causes of wall thickening such as airway \\nwall edema, mucoid impaction, and bronchocon -\\nstriction are potentially reversible [ 6]. Inspiratory \\nHRCT findings in subjects with asthma are iden -\\ntical to abnormal radiologic findings, such as \\nbronchial wall thickening (BWT), bronchial wall \\ndilatation, bronchiectasis (BE), mosaic lung \\nG.Y .

Gupta reported that abnormal \\nHRCT scan findings were common in patients \\nwith severe asthma (bronchiectasis and bronchial \\nwall thickening were observed in 40% and 62% \\nof all cases, respectively), whereas HRCT scans \\nwere normal in only 20% of all cases [ 9]. More \\nrecent studies of the airway immunopathology of \\nasthma have revealed that there is an important \\nchronic inflammatory component characterized \\nby cellular infiltration with eosinophils and lym -\\nphocytes, epithelial shedding, and subepithelial \\nfibrosis in the proximal large airways. Extensive \\ninflammatory changes have been noted in the  distal airways, which are associated with mucus \\nplugging and airway obstruction or obliteration, \\nin the lungs of patients who died of acute severe \\nasthma [ 10]. In one group of patients with severe \\nasthma, intrapulmonary airway abnormalities \\n(bronchial dilatation and bronchial thickening) \\nwere observed on the HRCT scans of up to 50% \\nof all examined patients [ 6, 10].\\nIn severe asthma, the small airways are also \\naffected by significant inflammation and remod -\\neling. Small airway dysfunction reduces ventila -\\ntion in part of the lung, thereby inducing reflex \\nvasoconstriction. This phenomenon is visualized \\nas an area of decreased attenuation on the HRCT \\nimages. Heterogeneity of lung attenuation on \\ninspiration CT scans is accentuated in expiratory \\nscans due to regional differences in small airway \\nclosure (mosaic perfusion and gas trapping). \\nTherefore, expiratory HRCT has been proposed \\nto be helpful for accessing air trapping (defined \\nas areas of increased lucency on expiratory scans) \\nin severe asthma [ 11] (Fig.  5.2).

These \\nabnormalities also represent radiological evi -\\ndence for distal airway obstruction in asthma. In \\ncontrast, changes in bronchial dilatation and wall \\nthickening were not significantly correlated with \\nFEV 1 [10, 12]. It is possible that the extent of dis -\\ntal airway obstruction is a feature of severe \\nasthma. In a study by Lynch and colleagues [ 13], \\nfull inspiratory CT scans were acquired from a \\ngroup of 48 patients with less severe asthma with \\na mean FEV 1 (% predicted) of 64%. Ten patients \\nshowed patchy ( n = 7) or diffuse ( n = 3) areas of \\nhyperlucency, which could represent air trapping. \\nBecause the distal airways of patients with \\nasthma are not readily accessible for study from \\neither the pathological or physiological point of \\nview, HRCT scan may be a suitable noninvasive \\nmethod for assessing distal airways. Carr et  al. \\nperformed inspiratory and expiratory HRCT \\nscans on 24 patients with chronic severe asthma \\n[10]. They observed concomitant dilatation and \\nthickening of the intrapulmonary airways in 12 \\npatients, whereas air trapping was noted in 20 \\npatients. The mean expiratory-to-inspiratory \\ncross-sectional area (Exp/Ins) was 75.9  ± 2.0%, \\ncompared with 44.6  ± 1.0% in non-asthmatic \\nsubjects. The FEV 1 (% predicted) correlated with \\nthe Exp/Ins ratio and with the CT features of air \\ntrapping (both r = 0.60; P < 0.001), but not with \\nairway dilatation or thickening. Peripheral air -\\nway obstruction may be common in chronic \\nsevere asthma, which may explain the increased \\nseverity of this type of asthma.\\nHRCT assessment of air trapping in asthma \\nhas been associated with airway hyperrespon -\\nsiveness, disease duration, and airflow limitation. \\nThis technique has been used to evaluate the \\nresponse to inhaled steroids. In addition, air trap -\\nping has been shown to correlate with asthma \\nseverity. The air trapping percentage of patients \\nwith severe asthma has been shown to be signifi -\\ncantly increased compared with that of normal \\nsubjects ( P < 0.005) [ 14, 15]. This result was \\nsupported by an analysis of tissue fractions at \\nfunctional residual capacity in patients with severe asthma, which revealed that the fractions \\nare much smaller than in normal subjects on both \\nthe dorsal-ventral and basal-apical axes. In addi -\\ntion to the overall air trapping percentage, the \\nlobar distributions of air trapping fractions at \\nfunctional residual capacity are different between \\nnormal subjects and patients with severe asthma. \\nMore specifically, the air trapping fractions in the \\nlower lobes of patients with severe asthma are \\ngenerally increased compared with those of nor -\\nmal subjects [ 16]. Moreover, the tissue fractions \\nof patients with severe asthma are much smaller \\nthan those of normal subjects in the gravitational-  \\ndependent and basal regions, implying the pres -\\nence of air trapping and reduced air volume \\nchange. These results are qualitatively consistent \\nwith studies of ventilation defects.\\nIn one study, airway abnormalities (bronchial \\ndilatation and bronchial thickening) were \\nobserved by HRCT in up to 50% of all patients \\nwith severe asthma [ 6]. Moreover, the airways of \\npatients who die from asthma have thickened \\nwalls. Dunnill et  al. reported that bronchial \\nsmooth muscle accounted for 4.6  + 2.2% of the \\nvolume of the normal bronchial wall [ 17]. \\nHowever, the volume in patients dying of status \\nasthmaticus was significantly increased, with a \\nmean value of 11.9  + 3.36% [ 17, 18]. Okazawa \\nand colleagues showed that even small airways \\n(1.5–6  mm luminal diameter) of patients with \\nasthma were significantly thickened compared \\nwith those of normal controls [ 19]. Also, the \\nmean percentages of wall area (WA%) in asthma \\npatients were 84% for small airways (luminal \\ndiameter <2  mm) and 58% for large airways \\n(luminal diameter >6  mm). Also, Awadh and col -\\nleagues reported that the mean WA% for all air -\\nways assessed was 78% for patients with \\nnear-fatal asthma but 70.9% for normal controls \\n[18]. Although the predominant site of airway \\nnarrowing in asthma is not clear, thickening of \\nthe airway wall in patients with fatal asthma was \\nobserved in both large cartilaginous and small \\nmembranous bronchi. However, this thickening \\noccurred predominantly in the small airways of \\npatients with nonfatal asthma [ 18, 19]. Gupta \\net al. reported the RB-proximal third-generation \\nairway was remodeled in patients with severe \\n5 Radiologic Diagnostic Modalities in  Severe Asthma', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 94}),\n"," Document(page_content='92\\nasthma, with luminal narrowing and an increased \\nWA% [ 9]. Importantly, WA% was associated \\nwith lung function impairment and was signifi -\\ncantly greater in patients with severe asthma with \\npersistent airflow obstruction than in those with -\\nout. Also, WA% has been shown to be associated \\nwith the burden of neutrophilic airway inflamma -\\ntion over time, suggesting that this component of \\nthe airway inflammatory profile may be impor -\\ntant in airway remodeling.\\nThe relationship of airway wall thickening in \\nasthma to lung function remains unclear. FEV 1 in \\nchronic asthma does not appear to reflect bron -\\nchial wall thickness as assessed by HRCT scan \\n[20]. Radiologically, observable wall thickening \\nencompasses smooth muscle hyperplasia/hyper -\\ntrophy and subepithelial fibrosis; extracellular \\nmatrix changes and structural changes in one of \\nthese locations may be more influential. The sub -\\nsequent effects on airway mechanics remain \\nunclear, although thickening of the subepithelial \\nlayer has been shown to decrease the airway \\nluminal area and exacerbate the effect of airway \\nsmooth muscle shortening [ 20, 21]. In pulmonary \\nfunction tests, FEF 25–75 values suggest that small \\nairway function may be influenced more by \\n bronchial wall thickening than by FEV 1. \\nAbnormal HRCT findings [e.g., bronchiectasis \\n(17.5%), emphysema (5.3%), and mosaic pattern \\nof lung attenuation (17.5%)] were more common in patients with bronchial asthma with moderate \\nto severe airflow limitation (FEV 1 <80%, \\nP < 0.05); moreover, patients with these changes \\nhad a more prolonged history of asthma \\n(P < 0.05) [ 22].\\nThe focus of the National Institutes of Health \\n(NIH)-sponsored multicenter Severe Asthma \\nResearch Program (SARP) is to identify pheno -\\ntypes enabling the separation of patients with \\nnon-severe asthma from patients with severe \\nasthma [ 23–25]. This search for phenotypes has \\nincluded the acquisition of volumetric computed \\ntomography (CT) scans of the lungs at both total \\nlung capacity (TLC) and functional residual \\ncapacity (FRC) [ 26]. Quantitative computed \\ntomography (QCT) has emerged as a reliable, \\nnoninvasive tool for the assessment of proximal \\nairway remodeling and air trapping in asthma \\n[26]. Airway lumen narrowing is another charac -\\nteristic of proximal airway morphology in \\npatients with severe asthma, as demonstrated by \\nQCT assessment (Fig.  5.3). In normal subjects, \\nair volume changes, volume change, and aniso -\\ntropic deformation of the lower lobes are greater \\nthan those of subjects with severe asthma. As a \\nresult, the dependence of air volume change on \\nthe lower lobes is greater than on the upper lobes. \\nIn contrast, deformation of the lower lobes is lim -\\nited in subjects with severe asthma, as suggested \\nby the observed decreased volume change and \\nab c\\nFig. 5.3  Images of a normal subject ( a) and a subject \\nwith severe bronchial asthma ( b, c).

These changes \\nresult in increased volume change and enhanced \\nanisotropic deformation in the upper lobes [ 26]. \\nIn both normal subjects and subjects with severe \\nasthma, CT-based total lung volume (CT) and air \\nvolume (CT) are significantly correlated with \\nPFT-based volumes at both TLC and FRC.  In \\naddition, the TLVs (CT) are in similar ranges \\n(~90%) as the PFT volumes [ 26, 27]. For air vol -\\nume (CT), approximately 20% and 40% reduc -\\ntions from PFTs are measured at TLC and FRC, \\nrespectively, in both normal subjects and subjects \\nwith severe asthma [ 28]. The air volume change \\nin normal lungs increases gradually from the \\napex to the base (from 20% to 80%) and from the \\nventral to dorsal lung regions, whereas air vol -\\nume becomes fairly uniformly distributed in sub -\\njects with severe asthma. Furthermore, the air \\nvolume change and volume change in subjects \\nwith severe asthma are increased in the upper \\nlobes but decreased in the lower lobes compared \\nwith normal subjects. Accordingly, the reduced \\nair volume change in subjects with severe asthma \\noccurs mainly in the lower lobes. This idea is \\nsupported by analyses comparing the contours of \\nair volume change that captured nearly 80% of \\nthe apical-to-basal distance [ 29].\\nAdvances in CT technology and post-  \\nprocessing software have quantitative assess -\\nments of the airway tree and the lung parenchyma \\n[9, 26, 29, 30]. Multi-detector row CT scanners \\nfacilitate isotropic acquisition of the whole chest \\nwith submillimeter resolution within a single \\nbreath-hold. Furthermore, rapid advances in \\npost-processing software for CT images now per -\\nmit multi-planar reconstructions, acquisition of \\nthree-dimensional surface and volume images of \\nthe airway tree and lung parenchyma, detailed \\nquantitative analysis, and virtual bronchoscopy. \\nQuantitative imaging techniques have enabled us \\nto obtain direct measurements by three-  \\ndimensional assessment of the large airways, as \\nwell as by indirect assessment of the small \\n airways by densitometric measures of paired \\ninspiratory and expiratory scans. Exact measure -\\nment of the airway wall, which requires identifi -\\ncation of the lumen-wall and wall-parenchyma \\nboundaries on CT images, is still an inexact sci -ence. However, a number of algorithms have been \\nproposed. One of the earliest proposed techniques \\nis the “full width at half maximum” principle [ 12, \\n31]. Although this technique is the most widely \\nused technique at present, it can cause systematic \\nerrors in airway wall and lumen estimation due to \\nthe blurring of edges by the CT scanner’s point \\nspread function, the oblique orientation of the air -\\nways, the algorithm used for image reconstruc -\\ntion, and/or the size of the analyzed airway [ 12]. \\nTo overcome these problems, various methods \\nhave been developed, including the “Laplacian \\nand Gaussian” algorithm [ 13], which utilizes \\nsmoothing and edge detection filters to segment \\nairways; the “integral-based method,” which min -\\nimizes the CT scanner’s blurring effect; and the \\n“phase congruency method,” which uses multiple \\nreconstruction algorithms to localize the airway \\nwall. However, most of these new software plat -\\nforms were designed for volumetric CT scans, not \\nfor standard HRCT scans. This aspect limits their \\napplication to retrospective analysis of archived \\nscans [ 26].\\nIn the early 1970s, Chiro et  al. introduced the \\nconcept of dual-energy CT (DECT) [ 32]. Xenon-  \\nenhanced DECT is a novel modality for evaluat -\\ning regional lung ventilation function. When \\ncombined with the dual-energy technique, xenon \\nventilation CT can reveal normal pulmonary ven -\\ntilation and is also technically feasible for \\ndynamic or static evaluation of regional ventila -\\ntion in asthma. Chae et  al. analyzed 22 patients \\nwith stable asthma by xenon-enhanced DECT \\nand found that patients with asthma with ventila -\\ntion defects had more severe airflow limitation \\nand airway wall thickening [ 33]. They also found \\nthat patients with asthma with ventilation defects \\nhad a lower FEV 1 and that the ventilation defect \\nscore was negatively correlated with FEV 1/FVC \\nand the corrected diffusing capacity. Since xenon-  \\nenhanced DECT has several limitations (e.g., \\nhigh radiation exposure, side effects of xenon gas \\ninhalation, and high cost), DECT ventilation \\nimaging with inhaled administration of xenon \\nhas been investigated at fewer centers than other \\nimaging techniques [ 34, 35].\\nFunctional images of ventilation using hyper -\\npolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging \\n5 Radiologic Diagnostic Modalities in  Severe Asthma', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 96}),\n"," Document(page_content='94\\n(H3HeMRI) have also been used extensively in \\nstudies of subjects with asthma [ 36]. Patterns of \\nhyperpolarized He-3 gas signal distribution tend \\nto change dynamically within a single breath-  \\nhold. Regional changes of airflow obstruction in \\nsubjects with asthma observable by H3HeMRI \\nhave been shown to correlate with measures of \\nasthma severity and spirometry. Specifically, the \\nrate at which voxel signals show the trend toward \\na more homogeneous pattern differs by asthma \\nseverity. The fastest rate of change was observed \\nin subjects with mild-to-moderate asthma, while \\notherwise healthy subjects with severe asthma \\nshowed relatively slow (yet statistically equiva -\\nlent) rates of change. These findings were sur -\\nprising, considering that subjects with severe \\nasthma subjects had the greatest overall spatial \\nheterogeneity in ventilation upon breath-hold ini -\\ntiation at end-inhalation [ 37].\\nIn conclusion, severe asthma is a complex het -\\nerogeneous disease with high morbidity and mor -\\ntality. Nonradiologic assessments fail to reliably \\npredict important bronchial wall changes; there -\\nfore, HRCT scan may be beneficial for all patients \\nwith severe asthma. HRCT scan is a repeatable and \\naccurate tool for noninvasive assessment of proxi -\\nmal airway structural changes in patients with \\nsevere asthma. In addition, quantitative CT is a reli -\\nable, noninvasive tool for quantitative assessment \\nof proximal airway remodeling and air trapping in \\nsevere asthma. Moreover, airway wall thickness in \\nsevere asthma progresses over time, as assessed by \\nrobust quantitative measures of wall thickness.\\nReferences\\n 1.

While guidelines for \\nthe use of biomarkers to guide CS use have been \\nproposed, the use of sputum eosinophils and/or \\nexhaled nitric oxide levels for guiding therapy in \\nsevere asthma remains controversial [ 5].\\n6.1.1.2   New ICSs\\nSince patients with severe asthma might often \\nrequire high doses of ICSs, the development of \\nnew ICS with improving pharmacologic effects \\nand fewer systemic side effects has been expected. \\nCiclesonide is one of new ICSs and appears to \\nhave the least systemic effects and local side \\neffects thanks to the pharmacologic characteristic \\nthat the prodrug is activated in the lungs to the \\nactive principle des-ciclesonide by esterases, \\nwhereas there is little activation in the orophar -\\nynx [ 6]. This pharmacologic merit lets cicle -\\nsonide be useful for the treatment of severe \\nasthma that required higher doses of \\nICS.

A major advantage of small-particle \\nICS is that they have improved total lung deposi -\\ntion (i.e., reach to smaller airways), and conse -\\nquently, effective asthma control is achieved at \\nlower daily doses than the large-particle ICS [ 7]. \\nBeclomethasone dipropionate is one of new \\nsmall-particle ICSs. Based on the pharmacologic \\nstrengths, we can guess that these new ICSs are \\nmore suitable for the treatment of the patient with \\nsevere asthma in whom there is inflammation of \\nperipheral airways with evidence of small-airway \\ninflammation [ 8]. In fact, recent clinical study \\nhas demonstrated that patients with persistent air -\\nway eosinophilia despite high-dose ICS \\nresponded to small-particle formulated ICS, and \\nthe use of this new formulated drug targeting the \\nasthmatic group with higher doses of steroid is \\nlikely to be beneficial [ 9].\\nIn addition to particle size of ICS, improving \\ndrug half-life may be of interest to some patients \\nwith severe asthma. Fluticasone furoate is a \\nnewly developed ICS with higher affinity to glu -\\ncocorticoid receptor leading to improvement of \\naction time compared to previous form of flutica -\\nsone, fluticasone propionate [ 10]. Recent studies \\nwith inhaled fluticasone furoate have shown that \\nthis translates to enhanced lung residency and \\nonce-daily efficacy in asthma [ 11, 12]. Some evi -\\ndence has also revealed that the characteristics of \\nfluticasone furoate may result in superior symp -\\ntom reduction compared with fluticasone propio -\\nnate [ 13, 14] or similar improvements in \\nsymptoms at less-frequent dosing schedules [ 15]. \\nIn addition, fluticasone furoate was developed as combination inhaler with LABA, vilanterol for \\nasthmatic patients. A randomized, double-blind, \\ndouble-dummy, parallel group study has shown \\nthat the efficacy of once-daily use of fluticasone \\nfuroate/vilanterol was similar to twice-daily fluti -\\ncasone propionate/salmeterol in improving lung \\nfunction in patients with persistent uncontrolled \\nasthma [ 16].\\nAlthough ICS is a locally administered drug, \\nnot systemic agent, leading to lesser side effects \\nthan oral/intravenous corticosteroids, all avail -\\nable ICSs are absorbed from the lungs, and thus \\nthey also have the potential for systemic side \\neffects. Many patients are more interested in the \\nharmfulness than their benefits. Based on these \\nunmet needs, dissociated steroid has been devel -\\noped, which attempts to separate the side effect \\nmechanisms from the anti-inflammatory mecha -\\nnisms of steroids [ 17]. Actually, several dissoci -\\nated steroids have now been developed, including \\nnon-glucocorticoid glucocorticoid receptor mod -\\nulators [ 18]. However, few have been tested in \\nexperimental models of asthma.

In fact, recent studies \\nhave reported that cholinergic activation plays an \\nimportant role in late response to inhaled allergen \\nin animal models, and muscarinic receptors can be activated by acetylcholine released from non-  \\nneuronal cells, such as epithelial and inflamma -\\ntory cells [ 25–27]. Moreover, a representative \\nLAMA, tiotropium, inhibits Th2 cytokine release \\nin allergen-exposed mice and that from human \\nPBMCs [ 28]. It also reduces eosinophilic inflam -\\nmation, mucin gene expression, and airway \\nremodeling in a murine model of asthma, possi -\\nbly through a direct effect on fibroblasts, suggest -\\ning that tiotropium might have anti-inflammatory \\neffects through inhibition of acetylcholine action \\non M3 receptors on inflammatory cells [ 29].

Moreover, several kinases are \\nalso associated with the development of steroid \\nresistance through glucocorticoid receptor phos -\\nphorylation, enhanced pro-inflammatory gene \\ntranscription, or decreased HDAC2 activity [ 41–\\n45]. In fact, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase \\n(MAPK) activates inflammatory genes in cells \\nform patients with severe asthma [ 46]. In addi -\\ntion, activation of MAPK has been found to \\ninduce glucocorticoid resistance in inflamma -\\ntory cells via phosphorylation of glucocorticoid \\nreceptor at the site of serine 226 [ 47–49] Many \\nkinds of oral p38 MAPK inhibitors have entered \\nclinical trials for various inflammatory disor -\\nders, but none have reached phase III studies \\nbecause of side effects and toxicity, as well as \\npoor or transient efficacy [ 50, 51]. The feasibil -\\nity of local p38 MAPK inhibition with less sys -\\ntemic side effects has been proved by an \\nexperimental data that an inhaled p38 antisense \\noligonucleotide is effective in suppressing aller -gic inflammation in mice [ 52]. Several potent \\nand selective inhaled p38 MAPK inhibitors have \\nbeen in clinical development for COPD, not yet \\nfor asthma [ 53]. Other MAPKs such as JNK and \\nERK pathway are also implicated in airway \\ninflammation [ 54]; however, the selective inhibi -\\ntors for JNK or ERK are not yet tested in clinical \\nsettings of severe asthma [ 55].\\nNF-κB is activated in patients with asthma as \\nwell as various inflammatory disorders and \\norchestrates the expression of multiple inflamma -\\ntory proteins, particularly in patients with severe \\ndisease [ 56, 57]. NF- κB activation is correlated \\ninversely with glucocorticoid responsiveness in \\npatients with severe asthma [ 44]. Huge amount of \\nevidence has indicated that NF- κB is a potent tar -\\nget of the action mechanism of therapeutic agents \\nfor severe asthma including several classic and \\nnew antioxidants [ 58–62]. Interestingly, recent \\npublications have also demonstrated that endo -\\nplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is implicated in the \\npathogenesis of severe asthma through NF- κB \\nsignaling pathways, and mitochondrial ROS con -\\ntributes to induce steroid-resistant asthmatic fea -\\ntures via NF- κB activation linked to NLRP3 \\ninflammasome activation in neutrophilic severe \\nasthma animal models [ 63, 64].

More interestingly, a recent \\nstudy has revealed that PI3K- δ isoform regulates \\nfungus-induced steroid-resistant eosinophilic \\nallergic asthmatic inflammation through ER \\nstress [ 73]. In addition, idelalisib (GS-1101, \\nCAL-101), a potent and selective small-molecule \\ninhibitor of PI3K- δ isoform, appears to reduce \\nallergic responses clinically and immunologi -\\ncally after an environmental allergen challenge in \\nphase I study enrolled with patients with allergic \\nrhinitis which is a representative comorbidity of \\nsevere asthma [ 74].

Actually, under pathologic conditions, oxi -\\ndative stress exerts a multitude of actions through \\nvarious signaling pathways involving MAPK, \\nPI3K/Akt, and protein kinase C (PKC), thereby \\nactivating pro-inflammatory gene transcription \\nfactors such as NF- κB, AP-1, and hypoxia-  \\ninducible factor (HIF)-1 α [58, 81–89]. Oxidative \\nstress is also involved in production of a number of inflammatory mediators, most notably eico -\\nsanoids, by activating phospholipase A2 (PLA2) \\n[90, 91]. Moreover, oxidative stress also reduces \\nsteroid responsiveness through a reduction in \\nHDAC2 activity and expression. Thus, several \\nantioxidants with good bioavailability or mole -\\ncules that have antioxidant enzyme activity have \\nbeen developed and tried as therapies through not \\nonly protecting against the direct injurious effects \\nof oxidants but also fundamentally altering \\ninflammatory events associated with the patho -\\ngenesis of asthma. However, unlike hypothesis \\nand favorable data from animal studies using \\nmany antioxidants including N-acetylcysteine \\n(NAC), vitamins C and E, and new generation of \\nantioxidants OTC, AD4, and CB3, previous \\nhuman studies to evaluate the pharmacologic \\neffects of antioxidants have yielded disappoint -\\ning results in bronchial asthma so far [ 54, 58, 61, \\n62, 85]. Nowadays, mitochondria-targeting anti -\\noxidants have been regarded as a breakthrough in \\nantioxidant therapy for severe asthma, since \\nmitochondria is a major source of reactive  oxygen \\nspecies (ROS) in  vivo and a promising target \\norganelle for immune and inflammatory \\nresponses. In fact, recent studies have revealed \\nthat mitochondrial ROS scavenger remarkably \\nattenuated the steroid-resistant asthmatic features \\nwhich are in both cases associated with not only \\nneutrophilic-dominant inflammation but also \\neosinophilic-dominant inflammation and TGF- β \\nmediated collagen production in asthma models \\n[63, 73, 92].

However, the \\nuse of PDE4 inhibitor was limited by inconsistent \\nefficacy and significant side effects, in particular \\ngastrointestinal problems such as nausea and \\nvomiting. The only PDE4 inhibitor so far that has \\ndemonstrated clinical efficacy with tolerable side \\neffects is roflumilast which is thus the new class \\nof drugs that has gained marketing approval \\n globally for use in patients with severe COPD. \\nTherefore, there has been increased interest in its \\npotential for the treatment of severe asthma [ 96]. \\nIn fact, the effects of PDE4 inhibitors were inves -\\ntigated in the model of allergen-  induced asth -\\nmatic reactions [ 97–99]. Roflumilast attenuates \\nthe late asthmatic reactions to allergens and aller -\\ngen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness [ 99, \\n100]. It also inhibits allergen-induced airway \\nneutrophilic inflammation which does not \\nrespond to treatment with corticosteroids [ 97, \\n101]. Moreover, a study has reported that a \\n4-week treatment with roflumilast of 500  mg \\nonce daily significantly inhibits exercise-induced \\nasthma [ 102]. An oral PDE4 inhibitor, roflumi -\\nlast, has an inhibitory effect on allergen-induced \\nresponses in patients with mild asthma and also \\nreduces symptoms and lung function similar to a \\nlow dose of ICS [ 103]. To avoid the significant \\nside effects which are big hurdle of the use of \\nPDE4 inhibitor as a therapeutic agent for severe \\nasthma, PDE4B-selective inhibitors or other \\ndelivery methods such as inhalation are under the \\ndevelopment and clinical trials.

When ER is stressed by some conditions such as increased \\ndemands in protein-folding load in ER lumen, \\ncells evolve an adaptive response called unfolded \\nprotein response (UPR). However, when ER’s \\nadaptive responses failed to restore the capacity \\nof ER to the normal physiologic status, ER has \\noverloading state with abnormal functions which \\nleads to ER stress [ 106, 107]. The ER stress is \\nassociated with pathogenic inflammatory mecha -\\nnisms, in particular several diseases such as neu -\\nrodegenerative disorders, metabolic disorders, \\ncardiovascular diseases, malignancies, and respi -\\nratory disorders [ 64, 108–110]. Moreover, pro -\\nlonged ER stress and UPR are implicated in \\nchronic lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, \\nα1-antitrypsin deficiency, idiopathic pulmonary \\nfibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, COPD, and \\nbronchial asthma [ 111, 112]. As for severe \\nasthma, recent interesting studies have been \\nreleased in which ER stress and UPR inhibitor or \\nchemical chaperone, 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), \\nsubstantially attenuated the steroid-resistant neu -\\ntrophilic and eosinophilic asthmatic features in \\nmice [ 64, 73]. Chemical chaperones, such as \\n4-PBA or tauroursodeoxycholic acid, were found \\nto be extremely safe in preclinical studies and are \\nnow in clinical trials for various diseases [ 113–\\n119]. These findings are very encouraging to pur -\\nsue the clinical development of chemical \\nchaperone as a therapeutic agent for patient with \\nsevere asthma, although so far, there are no stud -\\nies for severe asthma to enter clinical trials. \\nFurthermore, a recent study has introduced the \\npossibility of inhaled chemical chaperone as \\ntreatment for allergic airway disease, suggesting \\nits therapeutic potential with lower systemic tox -\\nicity for patients with severe asthma [ 120].\\n6.3  Endotype-Based Therapeutic \\nStrategies\\n6.3.1   Type 2 Related Inflammation-  \\nTargeting Therapies\\n6.3.1.1   Anti-IgE Approach\\nOmalizumab, an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody \\n(mAb), is the first targeted biologic therapeutic \\nS.R.

The mode of action of anti-IgE mAb, \\nomalizumab, is the blockade for IgE to bind IgE-\\nreceptor (Fc εRI) on the surfaces of antigen-pre -\\nsenting cells, mast cells, and basophils through \\nattaching to the Fc portion of free IgE with potent \\naffinity leading to inhibition of subsequent \\ninflammatory cell activation [ 121–123]. In addi -\\ntion, omalizumab prevent allergen-induced \\ninflammatory responses as well as long-term \\nconsequences of allergen exposure such as air -\\nway remodeling, inflammatory cell recruitment, \\nand Th2-biased inflammation [ 121–131]. \\nNumerous clinical trials have demonstrated the \\nclinical efficacy of omalizumab in reducing \\nmaintenance doses of oral corticosteroids and \\nICSs and in reducing exacerbations in patients \\nincluding children with severe asthma, although \\nno clinically measurable biomarkers have been \\nfound to predict a good response to omalizumab \\ntherapy [ 40, 124, 132–134]. In clinical practice, \\nthe use of omalizumab for adults and adolescents \\n12 years of age and older with moderate-  to-\\nsevere allergic asthma was approved by US FDA \\nin 2003 and by European Medicines Agency \\n(EMA) in 2005 [ 135, 136]. In addition, the pedi -\\natric indication for omalizumab in asthmatic \\npatients (use in children aged >6  years) was \\napproved by the EMA and FDA in 2009 and \\n2016, respectively [ 135–137]. With the expan -\\nsion of approval for the use of omalizumab, sev -\\neral international asthma guidelines and position \\npapers also recommend omalizumab as an add-\\n on therapy for the treatment of severe, IgE-  \\nmediated allergic asthma in patients including \\nchildren whose asthma symptoms are uncon -\\ntrolled despite optimal pharmacologic manage -\\nment and appropriate allergen avoidance [ 35, \\n125, 138–140]. Although anti-IgE was developed \\nfor allergic asthma defined by the presence of \\natopy and increased IgE levels, it is not always \\neffective in these cases. Moreover, omalizumab is so expensive and associated with side effects \\nrelated to multiple injections, the risk of anaphy -\\nlaxis, and even warning on cardiovascular risk. \\nThus, the development of biomarker to predict \\nand monitor the pharmacologic responses and \\nmore improved formulation of anti-IgE agents \\nare needed. Currently, the other anti-IgE mAb \\nunder development is ligelizumab which is a \\nhumanized anti-IgE antibody with a 50-fold \\nhigher affinity for IgE than omalizumab and \\nshows good pharmacologic effects including \\nreduction of concentration of IgE in allergic \\npatients with well-controlled asthma [ 141]. In the \\nfuture, the studies regarding the identification of \\nbiomarker to predict the therapeutic response, the \\ndevelopment of more potent anti-IgE agents, and \\nthe use of anti-IgE mAb to non-atopic severe \\nasthma with local IgE production are required for \\nthe precision medical treatment of severe asthma.\\n6.3.1.2   Inhibition of  Cytokines: \\nTargeting IL-4/IL-13  \\nand  IL-5, TSLP\\nBoth IL-4 and IL-13 bind to the heterodimeric \\ncombination of the α1 chain of IL-13 receptor \\n(IL-13R α) and the α chain of IL-4 receptor \\n(IL-4R α), which leads to the signaling of both \\nIL-4 and IL-13 [ 142]. In brief, IL-4R α is the \\ncommon receptor subchain for both IL-4 and \\nIL-13, which is present in both the type 1 (dimer -\\nized with γ chain linked to activation of T cells) \\nand type 2 (dimerized with IL-13 R α) receptors. \\nIL-4 activates both type 1 and type 2 receptors, \\nwhereas IL-13 only activates type 2 receptors. \\nThus, while IL-13 and IL-4 can promote IgE \\nswitching in B cells, T cell activation, and mast \\ncell recruitment, IL-13 alone cannot differentiate \\nT cells [ 143–145].

Eosinophilic inflammation is present \\nwith or without atopy, as a type 2-mediated \\nresponse can occur following allergic sensitiza -\\ntion, with consequent release of IL-5 from Th2 \\ncells, or in response to stimulation of airway epi -\\nthelial cells and infection through activation of \\nthe type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) [ 158, \\n159]. The IL-5 neutralizing antibodies, mepoli -\\nzumab and reslizumab, have started to be pre -\\nscribed by physicians and recommended as a \\ntherapeutic option by international guidelines for \\npatient with severe asthma showing high blood/\\nsputum eosinophil counts worldwide since the \\nlicense was achieved in the United States and \\nEurope in 2015 [ 160]. In earlier studies, mepoli -\\nzumab reduced sputum and blood eosinophil \\ncounts compared with placebo but had no effect \\non response after allergen challenge. In addition, \\nin patients with moderately severe asthma deter -\\nmined by disease severity, mepolizumab showed \\nno beneficial effects on symptom control or exac -\\nerbations [ 161, 162]. In later studies, when \\npatients with type 2 phenotype severe asthma \\nshowing eosinophilic asthma was enrolled selec -\\ntively, mepolizumab reduced exacerbation rate, \\nimproved the symptom control, showed steroid \\nsparing effects, and modestly improved lung \\nfunction independent of administration routes \\n(i.e., intravenous and subcutaneous) and doses \\n[163–167]. Reslizumab was similarly studied in \\npatients with poorly controlled asthma taking \\nhigh-dose ICSs and additional controllers with \\npersistent sputum eosinophils or blood eosino -\\nphils. Like mepolizumab, intravenous reslizumab \\ndecreased both blood and sputum eosinophil \\ncounts with increases in forced expiratory vol -\\nume in 1 second (FEV1) and asthma control \\nquestionnaire (ACQ) scores and significant \\nreduction of exacerbation compared with placebo \\n[168, 169]. Benralizumab is a recombinant \\nhumanized mAb directed against IL-5R α. Unlike \\nmepolizumab and reslizumab, benralizumab \\nbinds to IL-5R α on eosinophils and induces rapid \\ndepletion of eosinophils by antibody-dependent \\ncell-mediated cytotoxicity through natural killer \\ncells [ 170]. Two signature phase III clinical stud -\\nies (SIROCCO study and CALIMA study) have \\nS.R. Kim', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 107}),\n"," Document(page_content='107\\nrevealed that benralizumab reduced asthma exac -\\nerbation, improved lung function, and achieved \\nless asthma symptom score significantly com -\\npared to placebo [ 171, 172]. These results sup -\\nport for the earlier phase IIb study showing that \\nin eosinophilic asthma, mean FEV1 and ACQ-6 \\nimproved by the benralizumab treatment [ 173]. \\nUnlike mepolizumab and reslizumab which \\nshowed no significant effects on non-eosinophilic \\nasthmatics, benralizumab showed some pharma -\\ncologic effects on asthmatic features in non-  \\neosinophilic asthma which can be explained by \\nthe expression of IL-5R α on other cells such as \\nbasophils and mast cells [ 156, 174]. Additional \\ninteresting point is that effects of anti-IL-5 mAbs \\nand anti-IL-5R α mAb on lung function are differ -\\nent in patients with severe asthma. Although \\nthere are not yet a direct head-to-head compari -\\nson studies, small effects on lung function were \\nobserved in the phase III study for mepolizumab \\n[166], whereas effects on these outcomes were \\nmore robustly observed following treatment with \\nreslizumab [ 169] and benralizumab [ 173]. The \\nreason for these observations is unclear. However, \\nsome bronchoscopic biopsy data showed that \\nbenralizumab reduces bronchial mucosal eosino -\\nphilia to a greater extent than does mepolizumab \\n[164, 175]. Given that benralizumab can induce \\napoptosis of eosinophils unlike mepolizumab, \\nimprovements in lung function might be related \\nto the magnitude of the reduction in the airway \\neosinophilia.\\nTSLP is an IL-7-related cytokine secreted by \\nairway epithelial cells on allergen and other stim -\\nuli; it has been recently described innate “alar -\\nmin” capable of regulating type 2 responses \\nthrough activation of dendritic cells to release \\nchemokines that recruit and activate Th2 cells \\n[176]. TSLP levels are reported to be increased in \\nhuman asthmatic airways compared with those of \\nhealthy control subjects, particularly in those \\nwith severe asthma [ 177]. Tezepelumab \\n(AMG157, MEDI9929) is a human anti-TSLP \\nmAb that binds human TSLP preventing receptor \\ninteraction [ 178]. Tezepelumab (AMG157) \\nreduced allergen-induced bronchoconstriction \\nand indexes of airway inflammation before and after allergen challenge. Very recently, phase II \\nstudy to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tez -\\nepelumab in patients with severe asthma has been \\ncompleted and awaits the results [ 179]. In addi -\\ntion, another phase II study is ongoing to investi -\\ngate the effects on airway hyperresponsiveness \\nmeasured by mannitol provocation test in patients \\nwith asthma already on daily treatment with \\nICS. In this study, secondary outcome is to evalu -\\nate cellular phenotypes including mast cells \\n[180]. Nowadays, type 2-targeted therapy for \\nsevere asthma has moved into a new era thanks to \\nnewly emerging biologics. However, consider -\\nable challenges are also derived from these new \\ntherapeutic modalities including their long-term \\nefficacy and safety, their comparative efficacy, \\npatient selection related to biomarkers, and, \\nfinally, their cost-effectiveness.\\n6.3.2   Blockade of  Lipid Mediators\\nA cysteinyl leukotriene-receptor antagonist \\n(LTRAs) is an only antagonist against lipid medi -\\nators currently used in asthma therapy; however, \\nthese medications, montelukast and zafirlukast, \\nare much less effective than ICSs and have little \\nplace as add-on therapy in patients with severe \\nasthma [ 181, 182]. Apart from cysteinyl leukotri -\\nenes, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent chemoat -\\ntractant for neutrophils, mast cells, and T cells, \\nand its expression levels are increased in patients \\nwith severe asthma [ 183]. In addition, two recep -\\ntors for LTB4, BLT1, and BLT2 are identified, \\nand the two receptors differ in their affinity and \\nspecificity for LTB4 and in their expression pat -\\ntern. BLT1 is a high-affinity receptor specific for \\nLTB4 and usually expressed in leukocytes, \\nwhereas BLT2 is a low-affinity receptor and \\nubiquitously expressed [ 184]. Recently, papers \\nhave revealed that BLT1- and/or BLT2-targeting \\nstrategy led to attenuation of airway inflamma -\\ntion and airway hyperresponsiveness in a murine \\nmodel of asthma [ 185, 186]. Several studies are \\nongoing to test the effects of inhibition of BLT1 \\nand BLT2 on asthmatic features of severe disease \\nstatus. First 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibitor, \\n6 Pharmacologic Therapies for  Severe Asthma', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 108}),\n"," Document(page_content='108\\nzileuton, has been used for treatment of asthma, \\nbut due to adverse effects, its immediate release \\ntablet was withdrawn in 2008 [ 187]. Several \\nnovel 5-LO and 5-LO-activating protein \\n inhibitors are currently in clinical development \\n[40, 188]. GSK2190915, a potent 5-lipoxygenase-  \\nactivating protein inhibitor, prevents the synthe -\\nsis of leukotrienes and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic \\nacid (5-oxo-ETE). It attenuated the early and late \\nasthmatic responses in mild asthmatic patients. \\nIn addition, there was a statistically significant \\nattenuation of allergen-induced sputum eosino -\\nphil count. This study suggested the therapeutic \\npotential of 5-LO-activating protein inhibitor for \\npatients with asthma although further study is \\nneeded, in particular regarding the effects on \\nsevere asthma [ 189]. Prostaglandin D2, released \\nform mast cells, Th2 cells, and dendritic cells \\nduring allergen-induced reactions, activates a \\nchemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule \\nexpressed on Th2 cells (CRTh2), present on Th2 \\ncells, ILC2s, and eosinophils, and induces the \\nchemotaxis of these cells [ 190]. Production of \\nTh2 cytokines by ILC2s is also stimulated by \\nactivation of CRTh2 receptor [ 191]. In addition, \\nsome evidence has shown that the expression of \\nprostaglandin D2 was increased in patients with \\nsevere asthma [ 192]. Based on these back -\\ngrounds, several CRTH2 antagonists are now in \\nclinical development for asthma, including \\nAMG-853, OC000459, MK-7246, BI671800, \\nand fevipiprant (QAW039) [ 193]. Considerable \\ndata on favorable outcome in asthmatic patients \\nincluding eosinophilic phenotype has been gath -\\nered; however, there is still controversy on the \\neffects of CRTh2 antagonists on severe asthmatic \\nfeatures to date [ 194–197]. In fact, while AMG \\n853 did not improve asthma symptoms or lung \\nfunction in patients with uncontrolled moderate-  \\nto- severe asthma, BI671900 showed small effects \\non lung function in symptomatic patients, and a \\nphase II study with fevipiprant has recently \\nrevealed its beneficial effects on lung function \\nand eosinophilic inflammation in sputum and \\nbronchial biopsied tissues. Not yet, the findings \\nfrom phase III studies have been released.6.3.3   Chemokine Receptor \\nAntagonists: CCR3 and  CCR4\\nChemokines attract inflammatory cells such as \\nmast cells, eosinophils, and TH2 cells into the \\nairways, and they exert function through their \\nreceptors, chemokine receptors which are sur -\\nface molecules that belong to the family of \\nseven transmembrane domain receptors, desig -\\nnated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) \\n[198]. Among 18 family members of chemo -\\nkine receptor, the major focus of interest in \\nasthmatic patients has been the chemokine \\nreceptor CCR3, which is predominantly \\nexpressed on eosinophils and mediates the che -\\nmotactic response to CCL11 (eotaxin), which is \\nsecreted in asthma. Several small-molecule \\ninhibitors of CCR3 have been in clinical devel -\\nopment, but their effects in asthmatic patients \\nhave not yet been reported because they have \\nusually been discontinued because of toxicol -\\nogy problems. An inhaled antisense oligonucle -\\notide that targets CCR3 has some effect in \\nreducing sputum eosinophils, but results are \\ndifficult to interpret because IL-5 and GM-CSF \\nβ chain antisense were co-administered [ 199]. \\nIn terms of other chemokine receptors, the \\nCCR2, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR8, and \\nCXCR4 have been implicated in asthma, espe -\\ncially type 2-related responses. Substantial \\nexperimental data support the potential of che -\\nmokine receptor antagonists as therapeutic \\nagent for asthma, but controversy still remained, \\nand there are no definitive results from clinical \\ntrials [ 200]. A defucosylated antibody to CCR4 \\n(mogamulizumab) results in prolonged cyto -\\ntoxic effects on Th2 cells, marked and pro -\\nlonged depletion of Th2 cells, and reduced lung \\ninflammation in animal models. This antibody \\nwas granted approval for the treatment of \\nrelapsed or refractory adult T cell lymphoma in \\n2012 and is now in early clinical trials for \\nasthma [ 201, 202]. In addition, another small-\\nmolecule antagonist, an indazole arylsulfon -\\namide GSK2239633, appears to have progressed \\nto clinical trials [ 203].\\nS.R.

Blockade \\nof TNF- α is highly effective in patients with the \\ntype 1-associated chronic inflammatory disease \\nsuch as rheumatoid arthritis. In murine models \\ninhalation of TNF- α contributes to neutrophilic \\ninflammation and bronchial hyperresponsive -\\nness [ 204].

Infliximab \\nis an anti-TNF- α mAb which was also studied in \\npatients with non-phenotyped asthma. In patients \\nwith moderate asthma, infliximab treatment was \\nassociated with a decrease in diurnal peak expi -\\nratory flow variation and decreased asthma exac -\\nerbations [ 207]. However, in a large-scale study \\nin adults with uncontrolled severe persistent \\nasthma using golimumab, the anti-TNF- α \\nhumanized mAb had no overall beneficial effects \\n[208]. On the contrary, serious side effects asso -\\nciated with golimumab were reported including \\nan increased frequency of infections and malig -\\nnancies compared with placebo resulting in pre -\\nmature termination of this clinical trial. \\nTherefore, current evidence suggests that the \\nrisk of anti-TNF- α therapies outweighs benefit \\nin severe asthma.\\n6.4.2   Anti-interleukins: IL-17\\nIL-17A is one of the key players in neutrophilic \\nairway inflammation using animal models of \\nasthma induced by various allergen and stimuli [67, 209]. Additionally, a murine model of steroid-  \\nresistant neutrophilic asthma showed significant \\nincreases of IL-17A and murine IL-8 (CXCL8) \\nhomolog KC in lung tissues [ 64]. Indeed, elevated \\nlevels of IL-17A were found in the sputum and in \\nBAL of patients with asthma, and many studies \\nhave confirmed these findings and demonstrated a \\npositive correlation between IL-17A production \\nand asthma severity [ 210–214].\\nBrodalumab is a human anti-IL-  17RA mono -\\nclonal antibody which blocks receptor binding of \\nIL-17A and IL-17F but also blocks binding of the \\ntype 2-associated cytokine IL-17E/IL-25 [ 214]. \\nAgainst many expectations, despite good results \\nin preclinical studies, brodalumab had no effect \\non asthma control scores, symptom-  free days, \\nand FEV1  in non-phenotyped patients with inad -\\nequately controlled moderate-to-severe asthma \\nwho were receiving inhaled corticosteroid ther -\\napy. Although a phenotyped subgroup showing a \\nhigh bronchial reversibility exhibited a signifi -\\ncant improvement in ACQ score, the results had \\nuncertain significance [ 215]. Thus, a follow-up \\nphase IIb study focusing on this phenotype had \\nbeen performed, but it was stopped because of a \\nlack of reported efficacy in an interim analysis. \\nThere has been no further development of this \\nantibody in asthma. Secukinumab (AIN457), an \\nanti-IL-17 mAb that selectively neutralizes \\nIL-17A, has been tested in phase II trials in asth -\\nmatic subjects who are not adequately controlled \\nwith ICSs and long-acting b2-agonists \\n(NCT01478360). This study also has been termi -\\nnated with no significant beneficial effects on \\npatient group.

Furthermore, recent \\ninteresting studies have revealed that steroid-\\nresistant neutrophilic asthmatic manifestations \\nwere significantly controlled by the NLRP3 \\ninflammasome activation, and the severe asth -\\nmatic symptoms were dramatically attenuated by \\nthe blockade of IL-1 β or inflammasome inhibitor, \\nMCC950. Moreover, that increased NLRP3 and \\nIL-1β sputum gene expression was strongly asso -\\nciated with increasing asthma severity in humans, \\nsuggesting that the NLRP3 inflammasome is \\nimportant in human disease as well [ 63, 219].

First, several clinical trials suggest an \\nanti- inflammatory benefit of itraconazole in \\nABPA in asthma patients, which may be due to a \\nreduction in fungal burden or perhaps other non-\\nantimicrobial mechanisms [ 225–230]. Moreover, \\nthe use of azoles for ABPA in asthma patients \\nwas recommended by the Cochrane collabora -\\ntion [ 231, 232].

However, there were no sig -\\nnificant changes in asthma outcomes with the \\naddition of intranasal corticosteroid spray to \\norally inhaled corticosteroids. The therapeutic \\neffect was most pronounced with intranasal corti -\\ncosteroid sprays when patients were not on daily \\norally inhaled corticosteroids or when corticoste -\\nroid medications were inhaled through the nose \\ninto the lungs [ 243].

A great deal of research has \\nhypothesized that this increased asthma suscepti -\\nbility is related to an impaired interferon (IFN) \\nresponse to infection [ 249].

Clinical outcome could be very \\ndependent on the education and the partnership \\nin severe asthma.\\nInhalers such as inhaled corticosteroids, long-  \\nacting beta2 agonists, long-acting muscarinic \\nreceptor antagonists, and short-acting beta2 ago -\\nnists are main treatment modalities of severe \\nasthma. Inhalers are not like pills that patients sim -\\nply swallow with water: they have to learn how to \\nuse inhalers properly. I had a patient who visited \\nmy clinic due to frequent admissions by exacer -\\nbated asthma. He had to visit the emergency room \\nbecause of asthma exacerbation at least once a \\nmonth for 4  months, which led to subsequent \\nadmissions for several days each time. After lis -\\ntening to his story, I investigated all the medica -\\ntions that he was taking at his first visit. \\nInterestingly, he was taking a perfect list of medi -\\ncations for severe asthma: high-dose inhaled corti -costeroid with a long-acting beta2 agonist, a \\nlong-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist, the -\\nophylline, and a leukotriene receptor antagonist. I \\nsimply checked his inhaler technique, which \\nrevealed the secret of the frequent exacerbations. \\nHe totally did not know how to use the inhalers. \\nAfter learning how to use inhalers properly, his life \\nchanged dramatically. He could avoid further \\nemergency visits or admissions! There are many \\nexamples like this including cases in athletes who \\nhad to give up their career because of severe \\nasthma despite of medications, which turned out \\nthat it was because of their poor inhaler technique \\nor poor adhesion. Of course, after a proper educa -\\ntion and partnership, they could continue their lov -\\ning sports with controlled asthma. It has been \\nreported that many of asthma patients do not know \\nhow to use inhalers properly [ 1]. However, it is not \\njust patients but also physicians. It has been \\nreported that many general physicians do not know \\nhow to use inhalers properly, which addresses the \\nimportance of education on inhaler technique dur -\\ning the medical trainee courses [ 2, 3].\\nIt is also important for patients to get the idea \\nthat asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of \\nthe airway. Patients easily understand the mean -\\ning of “chronic disease” if you show the exam -\\nples of chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus \\nor hypertension which need continued pharmaco -\\nlogic and non-pharmacologic treatment for the \\nmanagement.

The patients should be \\naware that they must keep regular medications \\nincluding inhaled corticosteroid even after their \\nsymptoms disappear. They must understand the \\nconcept of management steps in asthma [ 4–6]. \\nEspecially for severe asthma, adherence is very \\nimportant in the management. Poor adherence or \\nstopping medications is one of the leading causes \\nof visiting the emergency room due to acute \\nasthma exacerbation [ 7]. Physicians should be \\naware that the patients does not normally wish to \\ntake regular medications for long term. This is \\ntrue even for some patients with definite symp -\\ntoms. Environmental factors such as inhalant \\nallergens, smoking, indoor and outdoor air pollu -\\ntions, and infections should also be considered in \\nsevere asthma patients (see next session). One of \\nthe key factors for successful education and part -\\nnership is education in self-management.\\nA written action plan is a very important strat -\\negy in self-management and should be provided \\nto patients with severe asthma. It includes the \\ndaily action plan and the action plan for acute \\nexacerbation of asthma [ 4–6]. Action plan shows \\nhow to recognize the loss of control and the \\nseverity of asthma: most of action plans show \\ngreen (good), yellow (mild to moderate), and red \\n(severe) zone according to the symptoms and \\npeak flow meter. For example, in green zone, \\naction plans show that the patient should take \\nlong-term control medications every day and \\nshow instructions such as how to prepare exercise \\nor things to avoid. If the patient has one or more \\nof the symptoms such as wheezing, chest tight -\\nness, cough, shortness of breath, waking up at \\nnight due to asthma symptoms, and the limitation \\nof activities due to asthma symptoms or some \\ndecrease in peak flow, the action plans show that \\nthe patient is in yellow zone and show the instruc -\\ntions that the patient should take long-term con -\\ntrol medicines and that the patient should increase \\nor add some medicine within 1  h if the patient \\nstill has the symptoms or decreased peak flow. If \\nthe patient has urgent signs of severe asthma exacerbation (severe dyspnea, difficulty in walk -\\ning or talking due to dyspnea, cyanosis, severely \\ndecreased peak flow (e.g. less than 50% of per -\\nsonal best), the action plans will present the \\nwarning signs and advise to take prescribed res -\\ncue medicines, to ask for immediate help, or to \\ncall 911.\\nAsthma is a common allergic disease with \\nhigh socioeconomic burden: although the propor -\\ntion is small, severe asthma spends much more \\nhealthcare costs than mild to moderate asthma \\n[8–10].

In suspected cases, appropriate  measures \\ncould be considered to eliminate or reduce the \\nexposure to the causative allergens. As studies of \\nindividual aeroallergen avoidance strategies show \\nthat single interventions have limited or no benefit, \\na multifaceted approach is more likely to be effec -\\ntive if it addresses all the indoor asthma triggers. \\nFor house dust mite, a Cochrane review showed \\nthat chemical and physical methods of reducing \\nexposure to house dust mite allergens at home \\n(including acaricides, mattress covers, vacuum \\ncleaning, heating, ventilation, freezing, washing, \\nair filtration, and ionizers) were ineffective [ 5, 11].\\nOccupational allergens such as isocyanate and \\nreactive dyes can also contribute to the develop -\\nment of severe asthma and should be evaluated in \\nsuspected cases [ 12–14]. Identification of the \\noccupational asthma and the causative allergen is \\nvery important because early avoidance is \\nstrongly recommended.\\nSmoking can provoke acute asthma exacerba -\\ntion but also severe asthma. It has been reported \\nthat smoking can reduce the lung function early \\nin asthma and the response to medications, par -\\nticularly inhaled corticosteroid [ 15]. Stop smok -\\ning and avoiding the exposure to smoking \\n(passive smoking) are very important in the man -\\nagement of severe asthma.\\nAir pollution can provoke the aggravation of \\nasthma. It has been reported that asthma-related \\nmorbidity and mortality could be increased due to \\nair pollution [ 16, 17]. Particulate matter (PM), \\nozone (O 3), nitrogen oxides (NO x), and SO2 are \\nmajor outdoor air pollutants that contribute to \\nincreased susceptibility to respiratory infection \\n[18, 19]. PM is a complex mixture of liquid drop -\\nlets and extremely small particles, composed of \\norganic and inorganic compounds [ 20]. PM 10 is a \\nPM less than 10  μm in aerodynamic diameter, \\nwhich can penetrate conducting airways PM 2.5 is a \\nPM less than 2.5  μm in aerodynamic diameter, \\nwhich can penetrate into the gas-  exchanging \\nregions of the lung [ 20]. Sources of ambient PM \\ninclude construction sites, smokestacks, fires, \\npower plants, and automobiles; the main sources \\nof indoor PM include ambient PM, tobacco \\nsmoke, cooking, and heating appliances. PM causes lung inflammation and mucous secretion \\nby acting on airway epithelial cells and alveolar \\nmacrophages and may lead to airway remodeling \\n[20]. Some Asian countries such as China, Korea, \\nand Japan suffer from Asian sand dust which orig -\\ninates from desert area of Mongolia and North \\nChina and which induces acute exacerbation of \\nasthma [ 21]. Smoking, combustion pollutants, \\nand volatile organic compounds such as formal -\\ndehyde and phthalate are examples of important \\nindoor air pollution [ 16, 17]. For the quality of \\nindoor air, it is important to control the sources of \\npollutants, to ventilate frequently, to change filters \\nregularly, and to adjust humidity around 50%.\\nRespiratory infection such as rhinovirus or influ -\\nenza infection is a major cause of asthma exacerba -\\ntion and also a leading cause of the emergency room \\nvisits for asthma patients [ 22]. Although the preven -\\ntion of respiratory infections is not always possible, \\nwashing hands is an important method of prevent -\\ning the viral respiratory infection [ 23]. Influenza \\nvaccination should be administered except the cases \\nof hypersensitivity to the vaccine. Pneumococcal \\nvaccination is also recommended [ 6].\\n7.3  Comorbid Conditions \\nof Severe Asthma\\nComorbid conditions may aggravate severe \\nasthma by medications or by diseases them -\\nselves. Comorbid conditions may compromise \\ntreatment options as well. With the exceptions of \\nsome medications, the underlying mechanism of \\nthe relationship between comorbid conditions \\nand severe asthma is still unclear.\\nAspirin can exacerbate asthma in about 10% \\nof asthma patients as a form of aspirin exacer -\\nbated respiratory disease (AERD) [ 24]. \\nHowever, the prevalence of AERD increases in \\nsevere asthma up to 25% [ 25]. Physicians should \\nbe aware that aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-\\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can induce very \\nsevere asthma exacerbation which could lead to \\nintensive care unit admission or more. Aspirin \\nor NSAIDs should be avoided in AERD. \\nAcetaminophen can be safely used in most of \\n7 Non-pharmacologic Therapies for  Severe Asthma', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 126}),\n"," Document(page_content='126\\nthe cases of AERD. Selective cyclooxygenase II \\ninhibitors could be also considered as an alter -\\nnative. But physicians should be always careful \\nbecause a small portion of the patients may \\nshow hypersensitivity reactions even to acet -\\naminophen or selective cyclooxygenase II \\ninhibitors [ 26].\\nBeta-blocker, especially nonselective beta-  \\nblocker, should be avoided in severe asthma [ 27]. \\nIf necessary, selective beta1 blocker in low dose \\ncould be tried with caution. However, higher \\ndose of selective beta1 blocker may lose the \\ncardio-  selectivity and may induce asthma exacer -\\nbation [ 27].\\nUpper airway diseases such as allergic rhi -\\nnitis or sinusitis commonly coexist with \\nasthma, which led to the concept of “one air -\\nway, one disease.” Chronic rhinosinusitis is \\ndefined as an inflammatory condition in the \\nnose and paranasal sinuses, characterized by \\nnasal blockage or nasal discharge, in combina -\\ntion with facial pain/pressure or loss of smell, \\npresent for a period of at least 12  weeks [ 28]. \\nControlling rhinitis and/or sinusitis is impor -\\ntant in the management of severe asthma [ 28]. \\nNasal saline irrigation may be helpful in addi -\\ntion to the use of medications such as intrana -\\nsal steroid, antihistamine, and leukotriene \\nreceptor antagonist.\\nGastroesophageal reflux disease may induce \\nasthma symptoms. Avoidance of precipitating \\nfactors such as caffeine, smoking, grapefruit, and \\nlate-night eating is important as a life style modi -\\nfication. Medications such as proton pump inhib -\\nitors can control gastroesophageal reflux which \\nmay reduce the severity of asthma in some \\npatients.\\nWeight reduction may improve asthma control \\nas well as lung function, small airway dysfunc -\\ntion, and airway hyperresponsiveness [ 28–31]. It \\nhas been reported that severe asthma patients \\nwith obesity have more symptoms, lower lung \\nfunction, and more frequent exacerbations. \\nObesity is also a risk factor of other comorbidi -\\nties such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or \\nobstructive sleep apnea syndrome that may \\naggravate asthma.Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associ -\\nated with poor asthma control [ 28, 32, 33] and is \\nvery common in severe asthma [ 34]. Treatment \\nwith continuous positive airway pressure may \\nimprove airway hyperresponsiveness, symptom \\nscores, exacerbation rates, and lung function \\n[35, 36].\\nV ocal cord dysfunction syndrome is caused \\nby a paradoxical movement of the vocal cords, \\nwhich induces resultant airflow limitation by the \\nadduction of the vocal cords. The symptoms are \\nthroat tightness, stridor, hoarseness, wheezing, \\ndyspnea, and cough, which may often lead to the \\nmisinterpretation of having severe asthma with \\nfrequent exacerbations and steroid resistance. \\nDemonstration of paradoxical vocal cord move -\\nment is the gold standard for the diagnosis. It has \\nbeen reported that the prevalence of vocal cord \\ndysfunction syndrome is 32–50% in difficult \\nasthma [ 37, 38]. Although the evidence is lack -\\ning, speech therapy that can relax vocal cords \\nthrough various exercises may be helpful in the \\nmanagement of some severe asthma patients.\\nA proportion of patients with difficult asthma \\nreports symptoms of anxiety and depression [ 39, \\n40]. It has been reported that anxiety, depression, \\nand insomnia were associated with poor asthma \\ncontrol [ 41]. Although there is some limited evi -\\ndence only, psychoeducational interventions may \\nbe helpful in the management of severe asthma \\nwith anxiety or depression.\\n7.4  Other Non-pharmacologic \\nTherapies\\nBreathing exercise program (including \\nphysiotherapist-  taught methods such as the \\nPapworth method and the Buteyko method) could \\nbe offered to people with asthma as an adjuvant \\nto pharmacological treatment to improve quality \\nof life and reduce symptoms [ 5].

We are living in the era of informa -\\ntion and communication technology such as \\nsmartphones, tablets, applications, website, \\nsocial network services, computing power, and \\nartificial intelligence. Future directions of non-  \\npharmacological management of severe asthma \\nare related with the advance in technology.\\nSmartphone and its applications could be the \\nkey components in the management of severe \\nasthma using technology. Although severe \\nasthma could be aggravated anytime and any -\\nplace according to the trigger factors, one cannot \\ncarry the written action plan all the time. However, \\nsmartphone is different. We bring smartphone \\nalmost everywhere and during almost all the \\ntime. Although the evidence is limited, some \\nstudies using smartphone applications on asthma \\nmanagement showed the possibility of increasing \\nthe adherence and improving quality of life, and \\nof reducing systemic steroid administrations and \\nthe emergency room visits [ 42, 43]. Another \\nstudy showed the possibility of monitoring severe \\nasthma with geolocation and air quality [ 44].\\nThere are many websites that provide useful \\ninformation on asthma including the validated \\neducational materials such as PDF files of leaf -\\nlet, e-books, video clips (lecture, interview, how \\nto use inhalers, and so on), and information on \\nair conditions such as weather, pollen counts, \\nand air pollution [ 45–47]. One problem of using \\nwebsites is that patients should gain access to the \\nwebsite in order to acquire the materials or the \\ninformation. This problem can be solved through \\nusing social network services such as Facebook, \\nTwitter, Google+, etc. We can send these useful \\ninformation via the social network services mas -\\nsively but specifically to the targeted users [ 45].\\nRecently studies on “Asthma Index” which pre -\\ndicts the possibility of asthma exacerbation have \\nbeen published [ 48]. The Asthma Index was devel -\\noped with monitoring asthma exacerbation and possible risk factors such as temperature, common \\ncold, air pollution, pollen counts, and so on.\\nSmartphone can be a platform of almost \\neverything: education, information, partnership, \\nand action plan. Smartphone applications that \\ncontain useful educational materials, information \\non the environment such as air conditions, the \\nelectronic diary on asthma that is very useful in \\ncommunication and partnership with physicians, \\nand the self-  management action plans have been \\ndeveloped [ 45].\\nComorbid conditions, not only disease but \\ndrug utilization, could be managed by informa -\\ntion technology. For example, in case of aspirin \\nor NSAIDs hypersensitivity, automatic alert can \\nbe delivered by electronic surveillance in elec -\\ntronic medical record system or by drug utiliza -\\ntion review.\\nSo far, the self-management plan on smart -\\nphone applications is based on the written action \\nplan algorithm according to the management \\nguidelines. Recently AlphaGo from Alphabet \\nInc.’s Google DeepMind became very famous \\nafter defeating the human world champions of Go \\n[49], and IBM Watson became very famous after \\nwinning at the Jeopardy quiz show. Artificial \\nintelligence is being studied for healthcare utiliza -\\ntion. IBM Watson is now available for supporting \\nthe decision in the management of cancer [ 50]. In \\nthe near future, advance in technology may bring \\nus in the era of managing severe asthma with arti -\\nficial intelligence which may evaluate the patient’s \\npersonal data including symptoms, signs, and \\ncomorbid conditions, as well as big data such as \\nenvironmental risk factors simultaneously and \\nconstantly, and suggest action plans accordingly.\\nIn conclusion, education, partnership, action \\nplan, environmental control, management of \\ncomorbid conditions, and information technol -\\nogy are the essential components of non-  \\npharmacological management in severe asthma \\n(Fig.  7.1). Pharmacologic treatment is always \\nimportant in severe asthma. However, physicians \\nshould be aware of the importance of non-  \\npharmacological management as well. This \\nwould improve the clinical outcomes of severe \\nasthma.\\n7 Non-pharmacologic Therapies for  Severe Asthma', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Severe Asthma.pdf', 'page': 128}),\n"," Document(page_content='128\\nReferences\\n 1.

Document(page_content='K19101\\nEnormous progress in asthma research has been made in the past 50 years, includ-\\ning a greater understanding of its complex pathogenesis and new and more effective \\ntherapies. Consequently, the scienti/f_ic literature has grown vast and can be dif/f_icult \\nto integrate. With contributions from a distinguished panel of world-renowned authors, Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice presents a comprehensive study of both the common and the more challenging problems faced by all health care \\npersonnel who treat patients with asthma. \\nThe book is divided into seven sections, starting with the basics of asthma and \\nending with a discussion on the approach to asthma worldwide and in the primary care setting. Re/f_lecting a strong clinical emphasis, each chapter begins with a patient case study supported by essential background information on the basic science and clinical decision-making process. This is followed by a discussion of clinical evaluation and management. \\nThe multidisciplinary coverage explores a range of topics including genetics, \\nin/f_lammation, immunology, and the identi/f_ication of different endotypes. Using a bench-to-bedside approach, the book links basic science to the clinical manage-ment of asthma and explores options for improvement. The carefully selected authorship from experts worldwide presents a truly global outlook.Pulminary Medicine\\nAbout the editors:\\nJonathan A.

Leonard Bernstein, MD, who was my role \\nmodel, mentor, and colleague. His thirst for knowledge and devotion to teaching, \\nresearch, and patient care were the qualities that inspired me to follow him into \\nthe field of allergy and clinical immunology. It is especially significant that this \\ntextbook focuses on asthma, as this “syndrome” was of particular interest to \\nhim, especially as it pertained to the workplace. Through my father, I was able \\nto better appreciate how our understanding of the immunopathogenesis and \\nphysiology of asthma leading to improvement in its management and treatment \\nhas evolved dramatically over the past 60 years from a condition that was at \\none time considered to be a psychiatric illness to what is now recognized as a \\ncomplex inflammatory lung disease influenced by a multitude of environmental and genetic determinants. \\nI. Leonard Bernstein recognized early on that the effective management of asthma required a team approach, \\nreflected in his early work with Dr. Tom Creer who developed the “Living with Asthma” educational model \\nthat became the prototypic design for all subsequent behavioral modification education programs. The \\nselection of contributing authors for this book who trained in multiple specialties and disciplines reflects \\nthe holistic approach to asthma care advocated by my father. Therefore, it is anticipated that this book, \\nwhich addresses the spectrum of basic and clinical issues pertaining to asthma, will be appealing to the \\nasthma specialist, the primary care physician, and other ancillary health-care providers that manage \\nasthma patients. Finally, like my father, who would not have been able to devote the amount of time to \\nhis profession without the dedicated support of his wife and my mother Miriam, I would be remiss in not \\nexpressing my deepest love and gratitude to my wife Lisa, who has been my greatest supporter and partner \\nthroughout my career and has given me four fantastic children: Alison, Joshua, Rebecca, and Caren.\\nJonathan A.

Over 300 million people in the world now suffer from \\nasthma. We have made enormous progress in asthma over \\nthe last 50 years with better understanding of its complex \\npathogenesis and we now have much more effective ther -\\napies, so that most patients are now able to lead normal \\nlives. This has been the result of an enormous investment \\nin research, so that the scientific literature is now vast and \\noften difficult to integrate. That is why comprehensive and \\nin-depth books like this are of enormous value in updat -\\ning readers in a series of chapters written by world experts \\non this disease. The great strength of this volume is that \\nit adopts a multidisciplinary approach, from basic mecha -\\nnisms, including genetics, inflammation, immunology, and \\nthe identification of different endotypes, through to chapters \\non the clinical management of patients and how this may \\nbe improved. A major strength of the book is in its clini -\\ncal chapters, which describe diagnosis, triggers, and clinical \\nmanagement in great detail, including the management of \\nasthma in special populations. Of particular importance are \\nthe chapters dealing with asthma in the primary care setting, \\nwhere most asthma is now managed.\\nAlthough we understand much more about asthma and \\nhave excellent therapies, provided they are used correctly, \\nmany unanswered questions remain. We do not know why \\nonly some people who are genetically predisposed develop \\nasthma, why asthma appears to improve during adoles -\\ncence and then often returns at some time in adulthood, or \\nwhy some patients develop severe asthma—which appears \\nto be a distinct disease. We still do not understand the dif -\\nferent phenotypes and endotypes of asthma and how these \\nshould be treated differently. Inhaled corticosteroids have \\nrevolutionized asthma therapy but are not effective in all \\npatients, and when discontinued, the disease returns. It \\nhas been difficult to find new therapies that match existing \\ndrugs. Biologics are useful in some patients and selective \\ntherapies may only be of value in distinct phenotypes of \\npatients that will need to be identified by further research. \\nWe do not have a cure for asthma, or even a treatment that is \\ntruly disease modifying. Many of these issues are discussed \\nin the chapters of the book from different perspectives. \\nThere is a wealth of information in this book and many \\npeople prefer to have a printed book than read different \\nreviews online. The multidisciplinary nature of this book \\nensures that every aspect of asthma is discussed, providing \\nan outstanding resource for anyone interested in this com -\\nmon disease from general practitioner to basic scientist. I \\ncongratulate Jonathan A. Bernstein and Mark L. Levy for \\nbringing together such an excellent group of authors from around the world to give a very comprehensive summary of \\nthe state of the art in asthma.\\nPeter J. Barnes\\nImperial College London\\nIt is my distinct pleasure to provide an introduction to this \\nexcellent textbook entitled Clinical Asthma: Theory and \\nPractice . Indeed, the editors, Drs. Jonathan A. Bernstein \\nand Mark L. Levy, have compiled a set of timely topics and \\na distinguished panel of world-renowned authors to con -\\ntribute to this book. The book is dedicated to Dr. Jonathan \\nBernstein’s father, Dr. I. Leonard Bernstein, a leader in the \\nfield of allergy and immunology who made many significant \\ncontributions to advancing asthma care.\\nThe book is divided into seven sections starting with the \\nbasics of asthma and ending with a section on the approach to \\nasthma worldwide and in the primary care setting. The open -\\ning section begins with an excellent overview of the epide -\\nmiology of asthma and moves its way through the important \\ntopics of immunopathogenesis, the rapidly developing topic \\nof genetics and the newly recognized area of endotypes and \\nasthma.\\nThe past 30 years have been marked by the introduction \\nand ongoing revision of asthma guidelines for asthma care. \\nThese guidelines, as discussed in individual chapters, must \\naddress the individual needs of preschool children, older \\nchildren, and adults and also allergic diseases, such as rhini -\\ntis, that are frequently associated with asthma. To understand \\nthe driving forces of asthma, attention is directed to viral \\ninfections, pertinent allergens, air pollutants, and exercise-\\ninduced asthma. In order to manage these triggers, detailed \\nchapters are provided on the assessment of asthma control \\nand the tools necessary to control the disease, specifically \\ninhaler devices, asthma education, and the importance of \\nassessing medication adherence.\\nTo achieve overall asthma control, it is important to \\naddress those special needs of children, adolescents, adults, \\nand the elderly in the principles of management. These top -\\nics are covered nicely in individual chapters devoted to these \\nage groups. Separate chapters are also devoted to acute and \\nlife-threatening asthma in children and adults. It is not only \\nimportant to discuss asthma by age, but also to consider asso -\\nciated conditions that can challenge the routine management \\nof asthma, such as obesity, pregnancy, psychological disor -\\nders, and the impact of occupational settings. Timely tips on \\nmanagement of these associated conditions are provided.\\nThe approaches to managing asthma can differ signifi -\\ncantly across countries in relation to economy, health-care \\nsettings and availability of medications.

Epidemiologists \\nare therefore inherently interested in disease definitions (and \\nsubtypes) and data sources for estimating both numerators and \\ndenominators to establish measures of disease frequency, pat -\\nterns, and outcomes.1\\nAsthma is now recognized as one of the most important \\nchronic conditions in the world, resulting in considerable \\nmorbidity and, in some cases, mortality, and posing a high \\nlevel of burden on health services and economies worldwide.2 \\nIn the United States, the annual economic cost (direct health \\ncare and indirect lost of productivity) is estimated to be $56 \\nbillion.3 While high-income countries are acknowledged \\nto have the highest prevalence, the rate of asthma is also \\nincreasing in other countries, possibly as a result of adopt -\\ning westernized lifestyles.4 The World Health Organization \\n(WHO) has estimated that 15 million disability-adjusted life \\nyears (DALYs) are lost annually due to asthma, representing \\n1% of the global disease burden.5 Asthma, the most common \\nchronic childhood disorder, is a common cause of school \\nabsence, regular medication use, and hospital admission.6\\nDEFINITIONS OF ASTHMA\\nAsthma is a disorder that can be defined by its clinical, physi -\\nological, and pathological characteristics. A major contribution \\nto understanding asthma in the nineteenth century was made by Henry Hyde Salter (1823–1871), a lecturer in physiology and \\nmedicine at Charing Cross Hospital, London, U.K., who sur -\\nmised that asthma could be caused by extrinsic factors (e.g., \\nanimal and vegetable emanations) and inflammation or conges -\\ntion of mucous surfaces.7 In the early twentieth century, asthma \\nwas widely believed to be a “neurosis” and the pharmacologi -\\ncal relief of anxiety became a major therapeutic goal. Francis \\nRackemann (1887–1973) suggested protein sensitization as a \\npossible cause of asthma, with patients categorized as intrinsic \\nor extrinsic and diagnosed (and treated, often ineffectively) on \\nthe basis of skin test findings. Since then, and despite substan -\\ntial research in the interim years, which has described asthma’s \\npathogenesis, etiology, and epidemiology, an all-encompassing \\ndefinition of asthma has remained elusive. In fact, it is now \\nknown that this condition is complex and manifests as many \\ndifferent clinical phenotypes (discussed later).8 One of the \\nmain issues in diagnosing asthma is its variable and intermit -\\ntent nature. The heterogeneity of an asthma diagnosis is most \\napparent in preschool-age children (5 years and younger). A \\ndifferentiation between viral-associated wheeze and wheezing \\nassociated with prematurity or parental smoking is required. \\nA diagnosis of asthma can be considered when wheezing is \\npersistent, it is nocturnally worsened in the absence of a viral \\ninfection, and the patient is atopic (in the presence or absence of \\neczema). A diagnosis in adults can be challenging if hyperven -\\ntilation, vocal cord dysfunction, or chronic obstructive pulmo -\\nnary disease (COPD) is present. Occupational asthma may be \\nimmunoglobulin E (IgE)- or non-IgE-mediated and is caused \\nby a spectrum of immunological agents or irritants.

In primary care, the symptoms of wheeze \\nand cough are often used to determine whether a patient has \\nsuspected asthma, and a recording of clinician-diagnosed \\nasthma is made if a patient responds to a bronchodilator (air -\\nways reversibility) or an inhaled corticosteroid.10\\nASTHMA PHENOTYPES\\nAs yet, there is no universally agreed upon asthma phenotype.9 \\nThe currently recognized phenotypes include early-onset, pread -\\nolescence asthma, which is mostly allergic in nature and driven \\nby T-helper type 2 (Th2) processes. The later-onset eosinophilic \\nphenotype is more common in women and adults older than \\n20 years and is pathologically associated with a thickening of \\nthe basement membrane zone and characterized by the presence \\nof eosinophilia as determined by sputum, bronchoscopic, or \\nblood analysis. Other phenotypes include: (1) exercise-induced \\nasthma, a non-Th2 asthma where reactive bronchoconstric -\\ntion occurs in response to sustained exercise, often in indi -\\nviduals with mild asthma; (2) obesity-related asthma; and (3) \\nneutrophilic asthma, in which neutrophils are prominent in air -\\nway secretions during acute, severe asthma exacerbations and \\npatients are relatively corticosteroid resistant.11\\nOther asthma phenotypes include aspirin intolerance, \\nasthma related to chronic or persistent respiratory infec -\\ntions,12 and steroid-resistant asthma, which has several \\nsubtypes and is thought to be characterized by the genetic \\nbackground of the individual.\\nKEY MEASURES, STUDY DESIGNS EMPLOYED, \\nAND DATA SOURCES AVAILABLE\\nSeveral epidemiological study designs and data sources \\ncan be used to try and estimate the frequency and patterns \\nof asthma, and to understand the etiology of the disease. \\nThe frequency is usually estimated from cross-sectional or \\ncohort studies. The risk factors are determined from cross-\\nsectional, analytical (in particular, cohort and case–control \\nstudies), genetic, and experimental studies. The outcomes \\ncan be determined using cross-sectional and analytical study \\ndesigns. Specifically collected or routinely available data can \\nprovide the data sources for these studies.\\nKey Measures  of IMportance  to epIdeMIolog Ists\\nThe key measures of disease frequency (see Box 1.1) \\ninclude: (i) the incidence of the disease, which is the rate of occurrence of new cases (which can be expressed as a cumu -\\nlative or person-time incidence); and (ii) the point, period, \\nor lifetime prevalence. Other indicators of interest to epi -\\ndemiologists include risk factors, which are any attribute, \\ncharacteristic, or exposure of an individual that will increase \\n(or reduce) their likelihood of developing a disease.13 The \\ncase fatality ratio refers to the proportion of people who die \\nfrom the disease.\\nstudy desIgns\\nThe prospective cohort study design follows groups of indi -\\nviduals who may not have manifested a disease or an out -\\ncome at the time of recruitment; it is often used to identify \\nsignificant host and environmental influences on health and \\nenvironmental exposures, and their effects on the expression \\nof chronic disease later in life.14 Large numbers are, how -\\never, typically required in order to identify significant dif -\\nferences in the incidence in exposed and nonexposed groups. \\nThis requirement for large numbers of cases usually means \\nthat cohort studies are expensive to establish and maintain. \\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS), whereby large \\ncohorts of patients are recruited to detect novel genes and \\nmarkers associated with disease susceptibility, are a more \\nrecently employed study design. GWAS have elicited new \\nlines of enquiry into the etiology and pathogenesis of asthma. \\nCross-sectional surveys, in which the data and the means of \\ncollection are specified in advance and the study population \\nis clearly defined, can be straightforward and inexpensive \\nand are attractive to scientists studying the epidemiology of \\nasthma.15 Cross-sectional studies also allow exposures and \\ndisease status to be assessed simultaneously among indi -\\nviduals in a well-defined population. There can be a spe -\\ncific interval, such as a given calendar year during which \\na community-wide survey is conducted, or a fixed point in \\nthe course of events that varies in real time from person to \\nperson.16BOX 1.1 KEY MEASURES OF \\nDISEASE FREQUENCY\\nIncidence : The rate of occurrence of new cases in a \\nperiod of time.\\nCumulative incidence : The number of new cases \\ndivided by the population at risk.\\nPerson-time incidence : The number of new cases \\ndivided by the person-time at risk.\\nPoint prevalence : The proportion of a population with \\nthe disease at one point in time.\\nPeriod prevalence : The proportion of people with the \\ndisease presenting during a period of time, usually \\n1 year.\\nLifetime (ever) prevalence : All people ever diagnosed \\nwith the disease in a population.\\nCase fatality ratio : The proportion of people who die \\nfrom the disease.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n"," Document(page_content='5 Epidemiology of Asthma\\nCase–control studies can be used to explore risk factors \\nby identifying people in a specified population with a disease \\nor any other outcome variable such as asthma or wheezing \\n(cases) and another group of people from the same popula -\\ntion who are unaffected by the disease or outcome variable \\n(controls). The occurrence of a possible exposure is then mea -\\nsured in both of these populations. One criterion of the con -\\ntrol population is that it should represent people who would \\nhave been designated as cases if they had developed the dis -\\nease. Another criterion of both cases and controls is that the \\nstart and the duration of exposure for these two groups be \\ndetermined. The cases and controls need not be all-inclusive \\nand may represent a subset of a population, for instance, pre -\\nschool children under 5 years of age. Incidence case–control \\nstudies use new asthma presentations as cases and random \\nsamples as controls. Prevalence case-control study design \\nuses prevalent cases and controls from non-cases.17\\ndata sources\\nSeveral data sources can be used for studying the epide -\\nmiology of asthma. Global population surveys include the \\nInternational Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood \\n(ISAAC) and the European Community Respiratory Health \\nSurvey (ECRHS). The ISAAC survey was conducted in 155 \\nparticipating centers from 56 countries.18 The survey was \\na simple one-page questionnaire self-completed by chil -\\ndren. For asthma, children were asked whether they had \\n“wheezing or whistling in the chest in the past 12 months.” \\nThe minimum sample size requirement that was used to \\nestimate the prevalence for each center was 1000 and the \\n12-month prevalence was calculated by dividing the number \\nof positive responses by the number of completed question -\\nnaires. In the majority of the centers, the response rate was \\nin excess of 80%. The ECRHS was conceived in response \\nto the growing evidence of increasing asthma morbidity \\nand mortality in Europe and elsewhere in the first half of \\nthe 1990s.19 Few studies of asthma prevalence prior to the \\nECHRS and the ISAAC used standardized definitions or \\ninstruments to measure the prevalence of asthma. ECRHS \\ninvestigators set out to create a standardized questionnaire \\nto estimate asthma prevalence and asthma treatment in \\nyoung adults aged 20–44 years and, in a subsample, to cre -\\nate a more rigorous examination to determine atopic sen -\\nsitization, bronchial lability, and suspected risk factors for \\nasthma. Asthma was defined by the ECRHS as having an \\nasthma attack in the last 12 months and/or currently taking \\nasthma medication. The questionnaires were distributed to \\n140,000 adults in 22 countries and although the primary \\nfocus of the ECHRS was to make comparisons between \\ncountries in western Europe, other center locations such as \\nAlgeria, Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, and the \\nUnited States were included.\\nNational health surveys such as those carried out in \\nEngland and Scotland have also provided a useful source \\nof information with regard to asthma prevalence and have \\ngiven insights into the health needs of specific populations.20 The potential of using information from routine data sources \\nto establish the accurate prevalence of a disease has also \\nemerged.21 The best routine information available is from \\ndeveloped countries, in particular the United Kingdom and \\nScandinavia.22\\nFREQUENCY OF ASTHMA\\nIt has been estimated that globally 300 million people have \\nasthma.13\\nfrequency  of asthMa by place\\nWorldwide comparisons of prevalence rates were determined \\nby the ISAAC cross-sectional survey. The highest prevalence \\n(36.8%) was 20 times higher than the center with the low -\\nest prevalence (1.6%) (Figure 1.1). The highest prevalence \\nwas found in English-speaking countries, including the \\nUnited Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and the Republic \\nof Ireland, followed by most centers in the Americas.23 The \\nlowest prevalence was reported in Indonesia, Greece, China, \\nTaiwan, Uzbekistan, India, and Ethiopia. The ISAAC ques -\\ntionnaire was also used to survey a younger age group of \\n257,800 children aged 6–7 years and similar patterns of \\nasthma symptoms were found.18\\nThe ECRHS found that the incidence rates of childhood \\nasthma (0–15 years) varied from 1.3 in Germany to 6.7 in \\nAustralia per 1000 person-years. The incidence of adult-\\nonset asthma was 0.3 in the Netherlands and Belgium, and \\n2.9 in Australia. The ECRHS also found a sixfold variation \\nin the prevalence of asthma, with high prevalence rates found \\nin the Anglophone countries. A wide range of prevalence \\nrates were observed between countries, with the highest in \\nthe Anglophone countries of Australia, the United Kingdom, \\nthe United States, and New Zealand, whereas the lowest \\nprevalence rates were in the Mediterranean region and east -\\nern Europe.\\nfrequency  of asthMa by people\\nThe frequency of asthma is highest during childhood and \\nusually peaks in presentation at approximately 5 years of \\nage with a secondary peak during adolescence (Figure 1.2). \\nWomen have a higher overall lifetime prevalence of asthma \\ncompared to men.24 However, more male children present \\nwith asthma up until 15 years of age, at which time a switch to \\nfemale preponderance occurs, which is sustained throughout \\nadulthood.25 The variation among different groups of people \\nof different ethnic backgrounds and countries of birth has \\nalso been described; however, the interrelationship between \\nethnicity and migration is complex, as demonstrated by an \\nanalysis of data from the 1% Morbidity Survey in General \\nPractice (MSGP) sample of the U.K. population, which found \\nthat all individuals (including whites) born outside the United \\nKingdom had a consistently lower incidence of asthma than \\nthose born within the United Kingdom.26 Similarly, children \\nborn in mainland China who migrated to Hong Kong have ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n"," Document(page_content='6 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nbeen shown to be less likely to wheeze and have atopic dis -\\nease than indigenous Hong Kong children.27\\nfrequency  of asthMa over tIMe\\nThe observed trends in the rate of a disease are important, \\nas any observed changes in the trajectory of prevalence \\nand incidence can provide a major clue as to its causa -\\ntion, which may help in the strategy for disease prevention. \\nThe increasing incidence and prevalence of asthma in the \\ntwentieth century have been well documented, although \\nthere are still areas where little or no data on asthma \\ntrends are available, including parts of Asia, Africa, and \\nSouth America.4 Data from Finnish military conscripts, \\ndating back to the 1920s, suggest that the very substantial \\nincreases in asthma prevalence began in the 1960s.28 The \\nECHRS29 found that in Spain, the incidence of asthma was higher in recent birth cohorts than in earlier ones, with sub -\\njects born in or later than 1966 having a twofold higher risk \\nof having had asthma attacks than the cohort born between \\n1946 and 1950. A number of studies in the United Kingdom \\ncarried out between the 1960s and the 1990s, in more or \\nless the same population using the same or similar meth -\\nodologies, have also reported inexorable rises in the preva -\\nlence of asthma and atopy.30 In the MSGP survey of general \\npractices in England and Wales (1991/1992), McCormick \\net al. found that, in the 10 years between 1981/1982 and \\n1991/1992, patient consulting rates for asthma increased \\nthreefold.31 Most of these increases in prevalence from \\nthe 1980s were driven by the younger age groups. Indeed, \\nduring the 1980s, the MSGP4 found that incident rates in \\nyoung children under 5 years of age in the United Kingdom \\nincreased from 192 to 339 per 10,000 people.31 The increas -\\ning rate of new cases continued into the early 1990s,32 United Kingdom\\nNew Zealand\\nAustrali a\\nRepublic of Ireland\\nCanad a\\nCosta Ric a\\nBrazilUnited States of Americ a\\nParag uay\\nUruguay\\nPanama\\nKuwait\\nSouth Africa\\nMalta\\nFinland\\nLebanon\\nKeny a\\nGerman y\\nJapan\\n/T_hailand\\nSweden\\nHong Kong\\nPhilippine s\\nBelgium\\nAustria\\nIran\\nArgentina\\nEstonia\\nNigeria\\nSpain\\nSingap oreMalaysia\\nPortugal\\nUzbekistan\\nOman\\nItaly\\nPakistan\\nLatvia\\nPoland\\nAlgeria\\nSouth Kore a\\nMoro cco\\nMexic o\\nEthiopi a\\nIndia\\nTaiwan\\nRussiaChina\\nGreece\\nRomani a\\nAlbani a\\nIndonesi aGeorgiaChileFrancePeruCountr y\\n05 10\\nPrevalence of a sthma symptoms ( %)15 20 25 30 35 40\\nFIGURE 1.1  Twelve-month prevalences of self-reported asthma symptoms from written questionnaires.

Other GWAS studies have found genes related \\nto asthma, including ORMDL3, which belongs to a family of \\ngenes that encode transmembrane proteins anchored in the \\nendoplasmic reticulum.39 CCR5Delta32 , which is thought to \\ncontrol pathogen entry into cells, has been found to be associ -\\nated with asthma in childhood, but not adults.40 The ADAM33  \\ngene has a role in the production of ADAM proteins. The \\nADAM proteins are membrane-anchored metalloproteases \\nwith diverse functions, including the shedding of cell-surface \\nproteins such as cytokines and cytokine receptors, which play \\na role in asthma.41 It is also possible that variations in asthma \\nmay be due to differences in the proportion of individuals in \\ndifferent ethnic groups who carry known or hitherto unknown genetic polymorphisms42 and that ethnic variability exists in \\nimportant gene defects such as filaggrin.38\\nCross-sectional studies have been used to investigate the \\neffect of risk factors on asthma, in particular, the interaction of \\ndietary factors and asthma.

There is difficulty in \\ndetermining the effect of an exposure (such as diet) within a \\npopulation on disease occurrence while accounting for factors \\nthat correlate with both the exposure and the outcome (con -\\nfounding) and effect modification, in which the magnitude of \\nthe effect on the outcome differs between groups. The recom -\\nmended adjustments for confounding in studies of diet and \\nasthma include maternal or child characteristics, socioeco -\\nnomic status, environmental exposures, and other dietary fac -\\ntors. Effect modifiers where interactions should be tested and \\nstratification considered include a family history of disease, \\nseason of birth or season of ascertainment of dietary factors, \\nsex, race/ethnicity, place of residence, and breastfeeding.46\\nThe exposure to respiratory infections early in life is thought \\nto play a role in asthma. The Oslo Birth Cohort Study recruited \\n3048 children born in the two main birth clinics in Oslo during \\na 15-month period beginning in 1992.47 Questionnaires were \\nallocated to the children’s parents at the ages of 6, 12, 18, and \\n24 months, and at 10 years of age a comprehensive question -\\nnaire was administered to 2540 of 2985 children of the birth \\ncohort. It was found that exposure to lower respiratory tract \\ninfections and croup during the first year of life increased the \\nchance of developing asthma by the age of 10 years. Several \\ndisadvantages of the cohort methodology were highlighted.48 \\nOne of the major problems of this work was selection bias as a \\nconsequence of “dropout” or the failure of subjects to continue \\nin the study (20% of cases had been excluded or had dropped \\nout of this study). However, the authors argued that exclusion \\nand dropout were not related to the determinants of interest \\nand would therefore not be an explanation for the observed \\nrelations between infant infection and the risk of asthma.\\nSignificant sex differences in the prevalence of asthma, \\nparticularly around adolescence, have led to hypotheses \\nregarding the role of the sex hormones estrogen (which has a \\nproinflammatory effect) and testosterone (which has an anti-\\ninflammatory effect).25 The systemic inflammatory milieu \\nresulting from obesity has also been suggested as a possible \\nrisk factor for asthma. This work has been complicated, how -\\never, by the physiological alterations in pulmonary physiol -\\nogy caused by obesity, leading to the confusion of asthma \\nwith dyspnea and other respiratory symptoms.49\\nIt has been widely recognized that air pollutants, which \\ntake the form of ambient photochemical oxidants, may exacer -\\nbate existing asthma. However, in westernized countries, there \\nwas less certainty of a link between pollutants and increases in \\nasthma and atopy.50 To investigate any link between pollution \\nand allergic disease, Von Mutius and colleagues carried out \\nstudies comparing atopy in schoolchildren between Munich (a \\ncity in the former West Germany) and Leipzig (a city in East \\nGermany) soon after German reunification. They found that \\nthe less polluted and the more westernized lifestyle of Munich \\nhad far higher rates of atopy.51 These findings prompted the \\nstudy of possible environmental contributors to asthma, in par -\\nticular for countries in transition from subsistence to affluent \\nconsumer economies.52 It is now largely acknowledged that \\nenvironmental factors differ between countries, and what may affect one population may not necessarily influence asthma \\nrisk in another; for example, evidence from the ISAAC study \\nsuggests that pollution may not be a causal factor for the devel -\\nopment of asthma per se (as opposed to asthma exacerbations \\nwhich may be related), as no correlation between air pollution \\nand asthma prevalence was found.53\\nAnother major risk factor for asthma is cigarette smoke. \\nEvidence exists that exposure in utero and in childhood can \\nincrease the risk of respiratory symptoms54 and that, at least in \\nyoung children, maternal smoking is linked with higher rates of \\nwheezing and recurrent respiratory symptoms.55 It is acknowl -\\nedged that smoky environments are unlikely to be the sole cause \\nof the rising asthma prevalence in westernized countries as ciga -\\nrette smoking has declined dramatically since the early 1970s.56\\nOUTCOMES (MORBIDITY, HEALTH-CARE \\nUTILIZATION, MORTALITY)\\nObserving the differences and trends in outcomes is impor -\\ntant. For clinicians, improving outcomes for patients with \\nasthma is the main goal. Patient outcomes that are more easily \\nquantified at a population level include the number of asthma \\nexacerbations (caused by poor symptom control), primary \\ncare consultation frequency, visits to Accident and Emergency \\nDepartments, hospitalizations, and deaths. The global rates of \\nmortality are thought to be considerable with 250,000 deaths \\nper year with 1 in every 250 deaths attributable to asthma.57 \\nDeaths from asthma are most apparent in low- and middle-\\nincome countries and in high-income countries where wide \\nsocioeconomic disparities and inequitable access to health \\ncare exist.5 Deaths and hospitalizations in these areas are \\nalso increasing. For instance, in the United States from 1980 \\nto 1999, the asthma hospitalization and mortality rates grew \\nby 1.4% and 3.4% per year, respectively, with children aged \\n0–4 years having the largest increase in prevalence and health-\\ncare use, but with adolescents having the highest mortality.58\\nWithin-country variations in outcomes by ethnicity are \\nof interest. However, the international data are limited. The \\nbest data on ethnic variations come from the United States \\nand the United Kingdom, where studies have, for close to \\ntwo decades, consistently demonstrated poorer outcomes \\nin black and South Asian ethnic minority groups.59 In the \\nUnited States, for instance, the burden of asthma has been \\nfound to be disproportionately higher in black children, with \\nlarge racial disparities for hospitalizations and mortality. \\nWhen compared with white children, black children were \\nmore than three times as likely to be hospitalized and four \\ntimes as likely to die from asthma.58 However, the reasons \\nfor these poor outcomes remain unclear. A systematic review \\nand a meta-analysis of U.K. data have demonstrated that the \\ndifferences between ethnic groups within countries—which \\nare substantial—could not be explained by the differences in \\nasthma prevalence, as the prevalence was found to be lower \\nin the ethnic groups in question.60 Although more robust data \\nfrom the United Kingdom suggest that the prevalence of \\nmultiple wheeze (a proxy for asthma) is high in South Asian \\nchildren, who are also more likely (than white children) to ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 27}),\n"," Document(page_content='10 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nbe hospitalized and, as such, have more persistent and pos -\\nsibly severe asthma.61 Possible reasons for the increased risk \\nof exacerbations, hospital admissions, and near-fatal episodes \\nin these groups include: (1) an increased genetic risk of severe \\ndisease; (2) the impact of migration; (3) an increased risk of \\nexposure to environmental trigger factors; (4) differences \\nin health beliefs and consequently health-seeking behavior; \\n(5) socioeconomic marginalization; (6) poorer quality of \\nasthma care; and (7) differential effectiveness of treatments.62 \\nAnother factor that complicates the use of epidemiological \\ndata to understand the reasons for poorer outcomes (and also \\nhigher prevalence) includes findings which suggest that many \\nwho have migrated from economically developing countries \\nwith private health-care systems have only a limited under -\\nstanding of the notion of prophylactic medication use and \\nare reluctant to use inhaled corticosteroids or other controller \\ntreatments when in relatively good health, particularly when \\ncoupled with a poor understanding of the disease.63 Added \\nto this is the persistent problem of institutional deficiencies \\nin care, which disproportionately affect minority ethnic peo -\\nple.64 The adverse effects of socioeconomic circumstances are \\nalso important to consider, as many of those from low-income \\nbackgrounds may view their asthma as less of a priority than \\nother day-to-day problems.64 Low-income families are also \\nless likely to proactively self-manage and are more likely to \\ncrisis manage their asthma.65,66 In such circumstances, indi -\\nviduals may bypass primary care and use the hospital emer -\\ngency department as their primary place for asthma care.67\\nIMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY, PRACTICE, \\nAND FUTURE RESEARCH\\nA continuing increase in the number of people with asthma \\nworldwide over the next two decades has been predicted such \\nthat it is estimated that there may be an additional 100 mil -\\nlion people with asthma by 2025.5 This will largely result \\nfrom increases in the proportion of the world’s population \\nliving in urban areas, in particular in low- to middle-income \\ncountries. It is likely, therefore, that without improved access \\nto treatments, hospitalizations and mortality from asthma \\nare likely to increase. As changes in the overall suscepti -\\nbility of the population to the development of asthma are \\nunlikely to have occurred, the increases in asthma cases \\nare more likely to be due to many different environmental \\nchanges, each exerting its own small influences in different \\npeople at different ages, living different lifestyles in urban or \\nrural environments.68 Periodic fluctuations in mortality and \\nthe remarkable and still unexplained rise (and peak in high-\\nincome countries) in the frequency of asthma across recent \\ndecades have been the focus of intensive research, but with \\nmixed and inconclusive findings with regard to asthma etiol -\\nogy. Attention should also be given to identifying the relative \\nimportance of risk factors in people living and emigrating \\nfrom low- to middle-income countries. This lack of under -\\nstanding may partly be due to a systematic marginalization \\nof many minority ethnic groups from asthma studies,69 and it is important that the substantial heterogeneity, which may \\nexist within different ethnic groups with respect to different \\nasthma phenotypes, is investigated.8\\nUnfortunately, due to the complex nature of asthma, purely \\ndescriptive studies, even of the magnitude of the ISAAC and \\nthe ECHRS, are of relatively limited value when attempting \\nto investigate the frequency and trends and the etiology of a \\ndisease (although any new etiological hypothesis will have to \\nfit with what is being shown in these large global surveys).70 \\nThere is, therefore, a need for well-constructed, longitudi -\\nnal studies that allow the temporal nature of the relationship \\nbetween exposure and outcome to be studied and firmer con -\\nclusions to be drawn. This approach can be both expensive \\nto implement and difficult to ensure adequate follow-up rates \\nover time. In high-income countries, recent advances in phy -\\nsicians’ use of electronic patient records21 and in the linkage \\nbetween routine data sets71 may allow a range of factors that \\nare important in relation to allergic disease etiology and out -\\ncomes to be assessed and controlled for. Using record linkage \\nof such data (with explicit patient and physician consent), it \\nis also possible to recruit patients into relatively short-term \\ncohort studies and then prospectively collect long-term rou -\\ntine data at relatively little cost. With the prospect of whole \\npopulation data linkages being made available in the near \\nfuture, we may not need to wait long for such studies to be \\ninitiated.72 Unlocking whether global differences in asthma \\nprevalence, the increasing rates found in low- to middle-\\nincome countries, and poorer outcomes are due to a combi -\\nnation of genetic and early-life environmental factors, or the \\nlack of preventative-related factors are also research priori -\\nties that need to be addressed further.\\nREFERENCES\\n 1.

He had no history \\nof childhood asthma or atopic diseases. He had smoked a \\nfew cigarettes daily for 2 or 3 years in his youth but did not \\ncontinue this habit. Spirometry confirmed airway obstruc -\\ntion, which was significantly, but not completely, revers -\\nible, consistent with a diagnosis of asthma associated with \\npersistent airway obstruction. There was also a significant \\ndegree of gas trapping with elevated residual volume. Jack \\nwas treated routinely with inhaled corticosteroids and bron -\\nchodilators, which afforded some control of his symptoms, \\nbut he remained breathless nearly every day and suffered \\nfrom two or three admissions to hospital almost every \\nyear with presumed infective exacerbations of his disease, \\nwhich he consistently claimed showed little response to the \\ncourses of oral corticosteroid therapy that he was invari -\\nably prescribed in these situations. A formal trial of oral \\ncorticosteroid therapy for 2 weeks was not associated with \\na significant ( <10%) improvement in his forced expiratory \\nvolume in 1 sec (FEV1). A computed tomography (CT) scan \\nof his chest showed generally thickened bronchial walls, \\nconsistent with asthma, but no bronchiectasis or interstitial \\nlung disease. Bronchial biopsies taken during a fiber-optic \\nbronchoscopy showed that while there were some infiltrating \\nmucosal eosinophils, neutrophils predominated. Similarly, \\ninduced sputum samples showed 6% neutrophils but <2% \\neosinophils. Jack was treated with a macrolide antibiotic for \\n3 days each week in addition to his inhaled therapy. This did \\nnot convincingly impact his day-to-day symptoms, but it did \\nreduce his acute admissions to hospital.INTRODUCTION\\nAs a testimony to the inadequacy of current asthma man -\\nagement, nearly 1000 asthmatics still die each year in the \\nUnited Kingdom. One of the characteristics of patients \\ndying of asthma is the exuberant inflammatory reaction in \\ntheir airways and the blockage of the airway lumen by thick, \\ninspissated sputum, causing asphyxiation.

Thus, \\nit is not clear if asthma is driven and triggered exclusively by \\nexternal environmental stimuli or whether the disease partly \\nreflects inherent disorders of those components of the airways \\nthat regulate resistance to airflow, principally the bronchial \\nsmooth muscle, but also the epithelial and submucosal lin -\\nings, which, when edematous, can reduce the internal caliber \\nof the airways. The key clinical features of asthma include:\\nVariable airway obstruction . Airway obstruction \\nin asthma, as measured by spirometry, may vary \\nspontaneously from none to severe in the course \\nof minutes to hours, and improves after suitable \\ntherapy. Breathlessness and impaired exercise tol -\\nerance in asthmatics arise from the increased ven -\\ntilatory effort that is required to move air in and \\nout of abnormally narrow airways and from the \\nobstruction of the small airways, which causes “gas \\ntrapping” in the alveoli, which, in turn, results in \\nhyperinflation of the chest and reduced tidal vol -\\nume. Airway obstruction also results in a feeling of \\ntightness in the chest, which may be perceived as \\nwheeze.\\nNonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity.  Nonspecific \\nbronchial hyperreactivity refers to the tendency of \\nthe smooth muscle cells of asthmatic airways to con -\\nstrict in response to a very wide variety of nonspe -\\ncific (i.e., nonimmunological) environmental as well \\nas pharmacological stimuli (including, for example, \\ncold air, smoke, exercise, aerosol sprays, and dust) \\nthat do not cause clinically significant bronchocon -\\nstriction in nonasthmatics. The mechanism of this \\nremarkable phenomenon remains obscure. It is fur -\\nther exacerbated by excessive mucus production and \\nedema of the airway mucosa, both of which further \\nnarrow the internal airway lumen, increasing the \\ndegree of obstruction produced by a given degree \\nof smooth muscle constriction. Bronchial hyperre -\\nactivity causes excessive cough and contributes to \\nbronchospasm. Again, different stimuli may pro -\\nvoke bronchospasm in different patients.\\nHISTOPATHOLOGY\\nAsthma is invariably characterized by inflammatory changes \\nthroughout the submucosa of the airways, but not the alve -\\noli or the lung parenchyma. This has naturally led to the \\nassumption that this inflammation is primarily responsible \\nfor the clinical features of the disease, although the evidence \\nto support this assertion remains largely circumstantial.1,2 \\nThe first principal characteristic of asthmatic inflammation is mucosal infiltration with inflammatory cells, particularly \\nmononuclear cells (macrophages and cluster of differentia -\\ntion 4 [CD4+] T lymphocytes) and granulocytes (eosinophils \\nand neutrophils). Some severe asthmatics appear, in addition, \\nto have elevated numbers of mucosal mast cells,3 but this is \\nnot universal; mast cells are present in all mucosal surfaces \\neven in normal individuals. Although invariably observed in \\nasthma, these changes do not allow a definitive diagnosis of \\nasthma on histopathological grounds, at least when studying \\nbronchial biopsies; for example, there is considerable overlap \\nwith chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Some \\nchronic, severe asthmatics show a paucity of mucosal eosino -\\nphils but a more prominent neutrophil leukocyte infiltrate, \\nand there has been much discussion about whether this can \\nbe correlated with the clinical phenotypes of asthma and \\nthe response of individual patients to conventional asthma \\ntherapy.4 The problem is that most of these studies are based \\non “snapshot” samples of the bronchial mucosa at a single \\npoint in time; there is little information on how mucosal \\ninflammation in individual asthmatics may vary with time \\nor, for example, during exacerbations of the disease. Claims \\nhave also been made, based largely on counting the relative \\npercentages (but not the total numbers) of eosinophils and \\nneutrophils in induced sputum from asthmatics, that it is \\npossible to identify a distinct clinical phenotype of “none -\\nosinophilic asthma.”5 Notwithstanding the validity or the \\ngeneral applicability of these observations, sputum induction \\nis itself a procedure that increases bronchial inflammation \\nand it is not clear whether the relative proportions of granu -\\nlocytes observed in induced sputum represent those within \\nthe bronchial mucosa. Furthermore, the relative percentages \\nof cells do not reflect the actual numbers. Consequently, it \\nseems justified to state that it has so far not been possible to \\nassociate etiological and clinical subdivisions of asthma with \\nreproducible and discernible variabilities in the histopathol -\\nogy of asthma.\\nIt has been stated that evidence of these inflammatory \\nchanges being responsible, in whole or in part, for the clini -\\ncal pathology of asthma remains largely circumstantial. The \\ncornerstones of this evidence are that mucosal inflammation \\nin asthma is universal and that anti-inflammatory asthma \\ntherapy, such as inhaled corticosteroid therapy, reduces the \\ninfiltration of the bronchial mucosa by inflammatory cells \\n(and thereby the production of their inflammatory mediators) \\nin concert with an improvement in the objective markers of \\nasthma severity, such as airway obstruction and bronchial \\nhyperresponsiveness.6 Nevertheless, it is still not possible to \\npoint to a particular cell or mediator and apportion its contri -\\nbution, if any, to the day-to-day variability of airway obstruc -\\ntion and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthmatics. Future \\nclarification of the histopathology of asthma is required to \\nfacilitate the discovery of valid and clinically effective new \\ntreatments for this disease.\\nThe second principal characteristic of asthmatic airway \\ninflammation is the variable presence of structural changes in \\nthe airways, collectively termed remodeling .7 These include \\nhypertrophy and hyperplasia of the airway smooth muscle ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n"," Document(page_content='15 Immunopathogenesis\\ncells, increased numbers of mucous goblet cells in the airway \\nepithelium, deposition of extracellular matrix proteins (includ -\\ning collagen, fibronectin, and tenascin) beneath the epithelial \\nbasement membrane and in the submucosa, and neovascular -\\nization resulting in a proliferation of the vascular capillary beds \\nwithin the submucosa. Some of these changes are not specific \\nfor asthma; for example, many chronic inflammatory pro -\\ncesses involving the bronchial mucosa (asthma, COPD, bron -\\nchiectasis) are associated with mucous hypertrophy. Smooth \\nmuscle hypertrophy, hyperplasia and extracellular matrix \\nprotein deposited within the mucosa of the airways appear to \\nbe more asthma specific. These features have attracted great \\ninterest because they have been postulated to contribute to the \\naccelerated decline in lung function and the irreversibility of \\nairway obstruction observed in some, but not all asthmatics. \\nAgain, there are interpretational problems with this hypoth -\\nesis. As already mentioned, some of these changes, such as \\nairway mucosal edema due to neovascularization and block -\\nage because of excessive mucus production, might intuitively \\nbe surmised to contribute to variable airway obstruction, while \\nthe deposition of extracellular protein might cause irreversible \\nchanges in airway function. However, as yet there is little or \\nno direct evidence that they actually do so. Currently, remod -\\neling changes in the asthmatic bronchial mucosa are widely \\nassumed to result from the release of mediators from infiltrat -\\ning inflammatory cells. While it is true that certain cytokines \\nsuch as transforming growth factor beta (TGF- β) produced by \\neosinophils can cause bronchial mucosal fibroblasts to secrete \\nfibrotic proteins such as collagen, while others such as inter -\\nleukin-25 (IL-25) produced by T lymphocytes and other cells \\ncan promote neovascularization,8 there are still many doubts \\nabout the cause and effect relationship between inflammation \\nand remodeling largely because it is so difficult to characterize \\nthe natural progression of these two phenomena. Confusingly, \\nof the few studies conducted in children, some have reported \\nthat severe asthma is associated with airway remodeling,9,10 \\nwhereas others11 suggest that remodeling changes predispose \\nto, but predate clinical asthma. Such studies cast doubt on \\nthe tenet that remodeling is caused by inflammation and, in \\nturn, contributes to asthma symptoms and physiology. In both \\nchildren and adults, remodeling changes have been linked to \\nasthma severity but less clearly to disease longevity,9,10,12 sug-\\ngesting that they are not necessarily cumulative, and even pos -\\nsibly at least partially reversible over time.\\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ASTHMA: \\nESTABLISHED VIEWS\\nrole of IMMunoglobul In e (Ige)-M edIated Mechan IsMs\\nIgE-mediated mechanisms, and in particular the IgE-\\nmediated degranulation of mast cells and basophils by cross-\\nlinking surface-bound, allergen-specific IgE leading to the \\nrelease of histamine and other mediators, were traditionally \\nconsidered the central contributing factor for understand -\\ning asthma causation and exacerbation, particularly before \\nthe possible importance of chronic airway inflammation was recognized. As late as the 1980s, the pathophysiology of \\nasthma was still viewed by many as a periodic, histamine-\\ninduced spasm of the bronchial smooth muscle caused by \\nallergen-induced degranulation of the bronchial mucosal \\nmast cells. This view of asthma pathogenesis was curious in \\nretrospect because it glossed over many obvious, inexplicable \\ninconsistencies, for example, that antihistamine therapy is \\nof little or no clinical benefit in the management of chronic \\nasthma, or that not all atopic persons with the propensity \\nto develop allergen-specific IgE in their airways develop \\nasthma whereas some nonatopic persons, who apparently do \\nnot manufacture allergen-specific IgE (at least none that can \\nbe detected systemically), do, nonetheless, develop asthma. \\nThe understanding of the possible role of IgE antibodies in \\nthe pathophysiology of asthma has recently been expanded, \\nfirstly by the recognition that IgE may play multiple, addi -\\ntional roles in inflammatory processes; for example, IgE anti -\\nbodies are of very high avidity and may play a vital role in \\nthe capture of antigens by antigen-presenting cells at mucosal \\nsurfaces, whether they are allergens or not. Secondly, it has \\nbecome clear that IgE synthesis may take place de novo in the \\nbronchial mucosa of nonatopic, as well as atopic persons,13 \\nwhich raises the intriguing possibility that IgE antibodies \\nagainst allergens or indeed other antigens could, in theory, be \\nmanufactured in the bronchial mucosa of asthmatics regard -\\nless of their conventional atopic status and play a role in the \\ndisease. Thirdly, and finally, the ability of the nonanaphylac -\\ntogenic monoclonal anti-IgE antibody omalizumab to reduce \\nexacerbations and, in many cases, the need for systemic corti -\\ncosteroid therapy in many studies across the world involving \\nboth children and adults with severe asthma14 clearly impli -\\ncate IgE-mediated mechanisms, at least in some patients, \\nin regulating the stability and arguably also the severity of \\nasthma. This antibody binds to the constant region of the \\nIgE molecule, which is why it does not cross-link adjacent \\nIgE molecules and cause anaphylaxis, and prevents the bind -\\ning of IgE to both its high- and low-affinity receptors Fc ɛRI \\nand Fc ɛRII (CD23). Thus, omalizumab has the propensity to \\nblock the full range of the potential immunological functions \\nof IgE in asthma. To date, clinical studies of its effectiveness \\nhave been directed exclusively at atopic asthmatics, since the \\ninitial assumption with anti-IgE therapy, based on the time-\\nhonored view of the pathophysiology of asthma expounded \\nat the beginning of this section, was that it would ameliorate \\nasthma primarily by inhibiting the allergen-induced release \\nof histamine from sensitized bronchial mucosal mast cells \\nby blocking the binding of their Fc ɛRI receptors to allergen-\\nspecific IgE. Interestingly, there are already isolated reports \\nof its efficacy in nonatopic asthma,15 and further studies will \\nundoubtedly follow. Although the efficacy of omalizumab \\nseems to confirm a role for IgE in the pathophysiology of \\nasthma at least in some patients, it seems unlikely that it acts \\nuniversally by inhibiting allergen-induced mast cell degranu -\\nlation. There is currently little understanding of which other \\nIgE-mediated processes might be relevant to the pathophysi -\\nology of asthma. It is also salient to note that approximately \\none-third of apparently eligible atopic asthmatics treated ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 33}),\n"," Document(page_content='16 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nwith omalizumab show no significant clinical response14 \\nand, to date, there is no understanding of what distinguishes \\na responder from a nonresponder. Whatever the reasons for \\nthis variability in response, these observations could be inter -\\npreted to suggest that IgE does not necessarily play a pivotal \\nrole in the pathophysiology of asthma in every person, even \\nif they are atopic.\\nt-helper type 2 (th2) t l yMphocytes  \\nand\\xa0assoc Iated Infla MMatory  pathways\\nSince the end of the 1980s, when asthma began to be rec -\\nognized as a chronic inflammatory disease of the bronchial \\nmucosa, the analysis of the nature of this inflammation \\nthrough a multitude of observational studies in human asth -\\nmatics, allergen challenge of both human subjects and ani -\\nmals, and substantial in vitro  data1,2 pointed quite firmly to the \\ninvolvement of CD4+ Th2 T lymphocytes with their capacity \\nto secrete a wide variety of cytokines and chemokines that \\nare not only able to promulgate the inflammatory granulocyte \\ninfiltrate which characterizes asthma, including mast cell, \\neosinophilic and basophilic inflammation, but also B cell \\nswitching to IgE synthesis and a range of asthma-associated \\nremodeling changes in the airway mucosa. Many, but not all \\nof the key cytokines implicated so far in the pathophysiol -\\nogy of asthma include those encoded in the IL-4 cluster on \\nchromosome 5q31: IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, and granu -\\nlocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), \\nand, in addition, chemokines, which are chemoattractive to \\neosinophils, such as eotaxin, or Th2 T lymphocytes such as \\nthe thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and \\nthe macrophage-derived cytokine (MDC).16 There is accu -\\nmulating evidence that the 5q31 cytokines are coregulated.17\\nAs with inflammatory cells, however, the evidence for \\nthe involvement of these cytokines in the pathophysiology \\nof human asthma, although extensive, has remained (until \\nvery recently with the development of biological agents able \\nto inhibit or neutralize particular cytokines or their recep -\\ntors) largely circumstantial. As knowledge of these media -\\ntors has increased, so the chasm of ignorance about what \\nprecisely they might do that is relevant to the spectrum and \\nthe day-to-day variability of the symptoms and clinical \\npathophysiology of human asthma has widened. This has \\nresulted in some unpleasant surprises, for example, the Th2 \\nT cell/IL-5/eosinophil axis, considered one of the corner -\\nstones of asthma pathogenesis. Although eosinophil matu -\\nration in the bone marrow, recruitment into the airways, \\nand survival in the tissues are potentially influenced by \\nIL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF, most attention has been focused \\non IL-5 as many studies have suggested that IL-5 is con -\\nsistently overexpressed in the asthmatic bronchial mucosa, \\noften to a degree that can be correlated in snapshot stud -\\nies with the degree of airway obstruction, and that its local \\nproduction by T cells is reduced in concert with the treat -\\nment and amelioration of asthma with corticosteroids.1,2 \\nFurthermore, IL-5 acts uniquely on eosinophils, which even \\nnow are considered a hallmark of the asthma process, with many studies suggesting that the percentages of eosinophils \\nin asthmatic airways, at least as measured in induced spu -\\ntum, predict the clinical responsiveness to, or compliance \\nwith corticosteroid therapy,18 even though, as mentioned \\nearlier, it has never been clear precisely how eosinophils \\nmight cause the clinical symptoms of asthma. For all these \\nreasons, IL-5 was considered a key molecular target for the \\ntreatment of asthma.\\nWith the advent of modern biological agents, it became \\npossible to address the hypothesis that IL-5 is a key molecu -\\nlar target for asthma treatment. A number of humanized, \\nmonoclonal anti-IL-5 antibodies have become available, \\nincluding mepolizumab, reslizuamb, and benralizumab. \\nThe treatment of patients with mild/moderate asthma \\nwith intravenous mepolizumab did not result in a signifi -\\ncant clinical or functional improvement either following \\nacute allergen challenge19 or in day-to-day asthma symp -\\ntoms following more prolonged therapy,20 despite causing \\nsubstantial reductions in the numbers of eosinophils in the \\nperipheral blood and induced sputum from the airways. \\nThese findings surprised the asthma research community. \\nDespite suggestions that the unexpectedly poor efficacy \\nof anti-IL-5 therapy might reflect its inability to remove \\neosinophils from the airway mucosa completely,21 the writ -\\ning on the wall seemed clear: anti-IL-5 therapy was appar -\\nently not going to be the panacea for asthma treatment that \\nhad been anticipated based on observational studies of its \\npathophysiology. Two smaller but important subsequent \\nplacebo-controlled studies22,23 of mepolizumab therapy \\nin severe asthmatics with persistently high percentages of \\neosinophils in their induced sputum despite systemic cor -\\nticosteroid therapy found that the treatment was associ -\\nated with a significant reduction in disease exacerbations. \\nThus, mepolizumab and similar anti-IL-5 strategies may \\nbe of therapeutic benefit in a subset of chronic, severe, \\ncorticosteroid-dependent asthmatics (possibly those with \\nhigh percentages of eosinophils in their induced sputum, \\nbut since the effects of mepolizumab were not assessed in \\n“low-sputum eosinophil” patients in these studies, this can -\\nnot be deduced with certainty). What these findings tell us \\nabout the pathophysiology of asthma and the role of IL-5 \\nand eosinophils in the disease is uncertain.\\nThis uncertainty about the role of mediators of Th2-type \\ninflammation in asthma does not seem to have deterred the \\npharmaceutical industry, which has plunged headlong into \\nidentifying new asthma treatments based on their effects \\nin a wide variety of animal “model” experiments typically \\ninvolving sensitization of the animal to an antigen by vac -\\ncination, intraperitoneally or otherwise, followed by an \\ninhalation challenge with the same antigen. These manipu -\\nlations are designed to recapitulate the Th2 T lymphocyte \\nparadigm in the airways of the animals in the short term, \\nand have facilitated the development of a wide variety of \\ninterventional approaches targeted at particular Th2 cyto -\\nkines or their receptors, including monoclonal antibodies, \\nsoluble cytokine receptors, gene fusion proteins, and siRNA \\ntechnology.

The “real-life” results with anti-IL-5 \\nstrategies in human asthmatics, however, seem to advocate a \\ngreater degree of caution.\\nThe therapeutic outcomes of targeting other Th2 media -\\ntors in human asthma, including IL-4 and IL-13, have so \\nfar proven similarly disappointing, although it is, as yet, too \\nearly to make firm conclusions.24 What one might conclude \\nis that future drug development should not rely completely \\non the outcomes of short-term models in animals involving \\nartificial antigen sensitization, which do not model chronic \\nasthma, obviously in terms of its longevity but also in terms \\nof its complex interactions with environmental influences \\nsuch as infectious agents, environmental pollutants, and \\nallergens, and endogenous influences such as hormones, \\ndrugs, and stress, repeatedly and over a prolonged period \\nof time.25 Another possible conclusion from the observation \\nthat only a subset of patients appears to respond to single \\nbiological agents is that asthma may be composed of mecha -\\nnistic subtypes that have yet to be identified. The identifica -\\ntion of biomarkers of responsiveness to particular biologics is \\nthe new priority,26,27 and this will undoubtedly increase our \\nunderstanding of the contribution of inflammatory media -\\ntors to the clinical pathology of asthma. It is not inconceiv -\\nable that the precise pathophysiology of asthma, taking into \\naccount the genetic, environmental, psychosocial, hormonal, \\npharmacological, and temporal influences on the nature of \\nthe disease, differs to a degree in every patient, but hopefully \\nresearch in the future will delineate major strands.\\nIn addition to cytokines and chemokines, cysteinyl leu -\\nkotrienes, which are primarily products of activated eosino -\\nphils, promote vascular leakage and thus edema of the lining \\nof the airways, and are also the most potent known natural \\nconstrictors of the bronchial smooth muscle. They have been \\nimplicated in the pathophysiology of asthma in the sense that \\nsome, but not all asthmatic patients respond favorably to leu -\\nkotriene CysLT1 receptor blockers such as montelukast and \\nzafirlukast.28\\nThe antigenic drive to Th2 T lymphocyte activation in \\nasthma is unknown. Again, largely as a result of the perceived \\nimportance of allergen-induced, IgE-dependent mast cell \\ndegranulation as a drive to asthma, there is a widespread tacit \\nassumption that inflammation in asthma is driven largely by \\nT cells that recognize inhaled allergens, some of which may \\nalso interact with allergen-specific B lymphocytes resulting \\nin allergen-specific IgE production and the atopic phenotype. \\nUntil it is possible routinely to identify the allergen specificity \\nof activated T lymphocytes within the bronchial mucosa, the \\nassertion that a majority of these cells recognize allergen epi -\\ntopes must remain hypothetical. It is quite possible that other \\nantigens may drive Th2 lymphocyte activation in asthma in \\nparticular circumstances. It is also possible to hypothesize that \\nTh2 lymphocyte activation becomes self-propagating with \\ntime, similar to what has been observed with autoimmune disease. This, in turn, may result from a defective inhibition \\nof these cells by T regulatory cells.29,30\\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ASTHMA: NEW VIEWS\\nwhy do soMe people develop  asthMa \\nbut not others?\\nThis is, of course, a question applicable to many diseases \\nof uncertain etiology, but it is a very fundamental one since \\na clear answer to the question of why asthma appears and \\nthen remits, at least clinically, in some persons but not others \\nwould likely embrace a lot of the fundamental understand -\\ning of its pathogenesis. If asthma is indeed driven primarily \\nby Th2 T lymphocyte activation, one might hypothesize that \\nthere are differences between individuals in the local envi -\\nronment of the bronchial mucosa yet to be discovered, which \\nresult either in the propagation of T lymphocyte activation \\non the one hand or its suppression on the other. These dif -\\nferences might reside in the structure of the mucosa itself \\nand the results of its interactions with environmental stim -\\nuli. The risk of developing asthma tends to run in families. \\nTwin studies estimate the proportion of the asthma risk to \\nbe 50%–60% genetically determined, and the remainder is \\nlikely accounted for by extensive and complex interactions of \\ngene effects with environmental influences. Genome screens \\nhave linked the inheritance of various chromosomal regions \\nwith an increased risk of asthma.31 Some of these regions \\ncontain genes encoding cytokines such as IL-4 or IL-13 or \\ntheir receptors, which have been implicated in asthma patho -\\ngenesis, suggesting that genetic variability in the expression \\nor actions of these mediators may contribute to asthma risk. \\nMore recent positional cloning strategies31 have identified \\nnew genes, such as ADAM33 , the products of which do not \\nplay a role in known asthma pathways, but are involved in the \\nnormal development of the airways during embryogenesis, \\nsupporting the possibility that a variability, as yet unchar -\\nacterized, in the structure or development of the airways \\npredisposes some individuals to asthma. The implication is \\nthat such variability might directly, or indirectly through its \\ninteraction with environmental influences, either promote \\nor inhibit the development of clinical asthma by regulating \\nmucosal inflammation or other mechanisms.\\nasthMa as an epIthel Ial dIsease\\nThere is accumulating evidence that diseases of the atopic \\nmarch, including asthma, eczema, chronic rhinosinusitis, and \\nfood allergies, arise from defects in the epithelial barrier func -\\ntion, which may facilitate, at least in theory, the penetration \\nof environmental factors such as allergens, viruses, and pol -\\nlutants into the submucosa.32–35 Abnormalities in the produc -\\ntion or function of proteins that maintain the epithelial barrier \\ncould constitute one group of potentially heritable factors pre -\\ndisposing individuals to the development of these diseases. \\nImpaired repair and “healing” of the airway epithelium is \\nanother well-described feature of asthma histopathology that ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 35}),\n"," Document(page_content='18 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nmay have a role in generating remodeling changes. Indeed, the \\nrecent fascinating obervation36 that simple repetitive distortion \\nof the airway wall through bronchoconstriction can cause epi -\\nthelial growth factor release and remodeling changes raises the \\npossibility that these changes initially arise independently of \\nthe asthma process as a “wound healing” response to repetitive \\nepithelial distortion, although they may later become relevant \\nto asthma pathophysiology if, for example, they eventually \\nresult in irreversible airway obstruction.\\nasthMa as a dIsease of Innate  IMMunIty\\nAsthmatics may exhibit deficiencies in their innate immune \\nresponses, which may, in turn, influence the microbiome of \\nthe airways37 and the susceptibility of individuals to respira -\\ntory tract infections.38 Rhinoviral infections are the principal \\ncause of asthma exacerbation38 and there is some evidence \\nthat such infections may program the airway dendritic cells \\nto potentiate Th2-type inflammation.39,40 Furthermore, asth -\\nmatic airway epithelial cells appear to be deficient in their \\ninnate response to rhinoviral infection mediated through \\nthe Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3).41 This observation and the \\nobservations42,43 that the development of asthma and allergies \\nin childhood can be associated with exaggerated bronchiol -\\nitic responses to rhinoviral infection together again suggest \\nthat one, possibly principal, facet of the pathophysiology of \\nasthma may be epithelial cell abnormality.\\nasthMa as a dIsease of bronch Ial sMooth Muscle\\nInappropriate bronchoconstriction and airway hyperrespon -\\nsiveness to multiple environmental and pharmacological \\nstimuli would appear first and foremost to reflect abnor -\\nmalities of the airway smooth muscle, so it might be consid -\\nered somewhat surprising that none of the aforementioned \\naccounts of the pathophysiology of asthma involves the bron -\\nchial smooth muscle. The fact is that although hypertrophy \\nand hyperplasia of the smooth muscle cells have been rec -\\nognized as a feature of asthma pathophysiology for decades, \\nnext to nothing is known about what causes these cells to \\nconstrict with inappropriate force in response to such a wide \\nrange of stimuli in asthmatics. Experiments are very dif -\\nficult because although it is now possible to routinely cul -\\nture the human airway smooth muscle cells from bronchial \\nbiopsies or resections, it is not so easy to measure the force \\nthat they generate in culture, particularly against an appro -\\npriate in vivo  load. The hyperresponsiveness of asthmatic \\nbronchial smooth muscle cells to a wide range of agonists \\nis clearly unlikely to reflect upregulation of the receptors for \\nevery one of these agonists or their corresponding signaling \\npathways. Recently, more sense of this phenomenon has been \\nmade from the observation that asthmatic bronchial smooth \\nmuscle cells abnormally express proteins that regulate intra -\\ncellular calcium homoeostasis, and thereby the resting intra -\\ncellular free calcium concentration and thus the force with \\nwhich the smooth muscle cell will respond to any stimulus \\nthat causes a transient intercellular calcium flux, which, in\\xa0turn,\\xa0triggers\\xa0contraction. For example, a deficiency of the \\nexpression of the SERCA protein44 has recently been impli -\\ncated in raising the baseline intercellular calcium in asth -\\nmatic smooth muscle cells, increasing their motility and the \\nsecretion of remodeling cytokines, and probably also their \\nforce of contraction, although this is difficult to measure. \\nAnother protein that regulates intracellular calcium in the \\nsmooth muscle cells is the calcium-sensing receptor. This is a \\npleiotropic, G protein-coupled receptor, which plays a funda -\\nmental role in mineral ion metabolism.45 While extracellular \\ncalcium ions are the physiological ligand for this receptor, it \\nis also activated by a range of polycations that are elevated in \\nasthma, such as poly-L-arginine, poly-L-lysine, and sperm -\\nine.45 Fascinatingly, eosinophil basic proteins such as eosino -\\nphil cationic protein are also polycations. If eosinophil basic \\nproteins have the propensity to “reset” resting intracellular \\ncalcium in the airway smooth muscle cells in asthmatics, \\nthis would provide the first clear link between eosinophilic \\ninflammation in asthma and one of the cardinal facets of its \\npathophysiology.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nAs stated, the traditional pathogenesis of asthma discussed \\nherein does not appear to explain the patient variability of \\nthe disease progression, its severity, or the response to differ -\\nent therapies. The complex nature of asthma influenced by a \\nspectrum of environmental and genetic determinants and the \\nredundancy in the pathophysiological effects of mediators, \\nchemokines, and cytokines make it unlikely that treatments \\ndesigned to target one facet of this disease will be successful. \\nThe future development of novel asthma therapies may need \\nto be restricted to a specific patient profile or endotype based \\non the pathogenic features of the patient’s disease.\\nREFERENCES\\n 1.

As she checks in, a clinical nurse asks \\nto speak to the patient about the Center for Personalized \\nMedicine at the hospital. The nurse coordinator explains that \\nthe patient has the option to give consent to have her genome \\ncompletely sequenced, and for her electronic medical record \\nand any clinical samples that may be obtained during her \\ntreatment linked to this genomic information. The patient \\nreads the material thoroughly, discusses questions with the \\nclinical staff, and provides a detailed written consent. Blood \\nis drawn for genome sequencing and the patient proceeds \\nto her examination. After an initial assessment, the patient \\nis referred to a pulmonary physician for spirometry, allergy \\ntesting, and several other biomarker measurements. The \\npatient is diagnosed with moderately severe allergic asthma \\nand is prescribed standard medications, including inhaled \\ncorticosteroids and an albuterol rescue inhaler. The physi -\\ncian also mentions that a clinical trial of a novel biologic \\ntherapy for asthma is available for enrollment. However, \\nthe physician discusses with the patient that this treatment \\nis most effective in a group of patients with high levels of \\na specific serum biomarker but it can have rare adverse \\neffects in a group of patients with a specific genetic variant. \\nThis gene variation is relatively uncommon but the patient \\ndecides to await the results of her genome sequencing to \\ndecide whether she wants to enroll in the trial. The following \\nmonth, her physician receives a text message alert from the patient’s medical record indicating that the patient has the \\nmost common form of the gene, so her genetic risk profile is \\nsafe. She decides to participate in the trial of the novel bio -\\nlogic therapy for asthma.\\nThis personalized medicine scenario could be a reality \\nin the near future, as many large hospitals and academic \\nmedical centers seek to link genomic information with clini -\\ncal and demographic information and clinical specimens. \\nThrough an active consenting process, patients with asthma \\nor other common diseases may soon have the majority of \\nthis information available in their electronic medical record, \\nwhich can then provide immediate information to their phy -\\nsicians based on their genotype for specific indications (such \\nas responsiveness to a therapy or risk of adverse effects), \\nwho can suggest safe and effective treatment choices.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAsthma is a heterogeneous disease of related clinical pheno -\\ntypes with a complex etiology based on genetic susceptibil -\\nity and environmental influences.

Some of \\nthese genes have previously been linked to asthma or other \\nrelated allergic phenotypes in earlier candidate gene or posi -\\ntional cloning studies, suggesting that shared inflammatory \\npathways may be affected. For example, the MHC region \\nwas one of the first asthma susceptibility loci identified5 and \\nit appears to play a major role in asthma and allergen sen -\\nsitization.3 Regulatory T cell signaling genes, such as the \\nSMAD family member 3 ( SMAD3 ), encoding a transcrip -\\ntional modulator related to transforming growth factor β, \\nmay also play a critical role in the development of asthma. \\nA number of these susceptibility genes have been replicated \\nin some but not all populations, suggesting that there may \\nbe heterogeneity in the genetic risk in populations of differ -\\nent ethnic backgrounds. The results from major GWAS and \\nmeta-analyses of asthma reviewed in this chapter are sum -\\nmarized in Table 3.1.\\nCurrent genomic asthma research is focused on identifying \\nthe genetic factors that affect not only the disease susceptibil -\\nity but also the progression and severity of asthma. Asthma \\nseverity genes may be related to specific endophenotypes, \\nsome of which are discussed in this chapter and summarized in \\nTable\\xa03.2: (1) genes related to pulmonary function; (2) biomark -\\ners related to asthma progression and the risk of exacerbations; \\n(3) pharmacogenetic interactions in which an individual may \\nhave reduced responsiveness or be resistant to a specific asthma \\ntherapy; and (4) gene–environment interactions.\\nGWAS OF ASTHMA SUSCEPTIBILITY\\nPrior to 2007, candidate genes in asthma and allergy biologi -\\ncal pathways were tested for their association with asthma \\nsusceptibility, and family studies and positional cloning tech -\\nniques identified several putative chromosomal loci related to \\nasthma. However, many of the positive genetic associations from these earlier studies were not consistently replicated, \\npossibly due to relatively small sample sizes, inconsistent \\nphenotype definitions, population stratification, and lack \\nof adequate genomic coverage. Following the transition to \\nGWAS, the risk variants discovered in these genome-wide \\nscreens were more likely to be replicated, at least in popula -\\ntions of similar ethnic backgrounds. This section highlights \\nsome of the major genome-wide studies of asthma suscepti -\\nbility (Table 3.1).\\ngwas of asthMa suscept IbIlIty \\nIn MultIple ethnIc groups\\nBased on a doctor’s diagnosis of asthma, the first asthma sus -\\nceptibility GWAS was published in 2007 by the European \\nGABRIEL consortium. This study identified variants in the \\nORMDL3  gene on chromosome 17q12-21 as predictors of \\nchildhood asthma susceptibility.1 A large follow-up study in \\nthe same cohort verified this finding2 and many subsequent \\nGWAS have also confirmed this result.4 However, there is \\na high degree of correlation or linkage disequilibrium (LD) \\nin this region that spans several genes and it is still not clear \\nwhether ORMDL3  or a nearby gene is the risk gene for \\nasthma with the causative variant(s). A splice-site mutation \\nhas been identified through sequencing, which is in strong \\nLD with ORMDL3  but is located on the adjacent gasdermin-\\nlike B ( GSDMB ) gene, indicating that this gene may be the \\nactual causal risk variant for asthma.6 This example rein -\\nforces the importance of new genetic sequencing projects \\nand how these technologies continue to facilitate an under -\\nstanding of the genetic risk for asthma.\\nMany of the initial asthma GWAS were carried out in \\nnon-Hispanic white discovery cohorts, although minority \\nethnic groups such as African Americans are more likely to \\nexperience higher asthma morbidity and mortality rates than \\nwhites.7,8 Populations of different ancestry also have different \\npatterns of gene variation and LD that can alter the gene-\\nspecific risk variants. Therefore, it is critical to investigate \\nthe genetic pathways that play a role in asthma in individu -\\nals of different ethnic backgrounds. Whereas the GABRIEL \\nconsortium consisted of European individuals with asthma,1 \\nthe North American EVE meta-analysis for asthma suscepti -\\nbility was established in individuals of European American, \\nAfrican American or Afro-Caribbean, and Latino ances -\\ntry. In EVE, five major susceptibility loci were identified \\nin 5,416 asthma cases and replication was performed in an \\nadditional 12,649 individuals. Four of the chromosomal \\nregions that reached genome-wide significance had been \\npreviously identified in GABRIEL or other studies: loci in \\nthe ORMDL3  region of 17q21, the interleukin 1 receptor-like \\n1 isoform/interleukin 18 receptor ( IL-1RL1 /IL-18R ) loci on \\nchromosome 2q, the TSLP  gene region on 5q22, and IL-33  \\non chromosome 9p24.4 These loci are associated with the \\ndevelopment of asthma across ethnic groups, and a novel \\nsusceptibility locus in individuals of African descent was \\nalso identified: pyrin and HIN domain family, member 1 \\n(PYHIN1 ) on chromosome 1q23.4 Prior to the EVE analysis, TABLE 3.1\\nSignificant Asthma Susceptibility Genes from Meta-\\nAnalyses or Replicated GWAS and Primary References\\nGene(s)Chromosomal \\nRegionEthnic \\nBackground(s) References\\nPYHIN1 1q23 African [4]\\nIL-1RL1/IL-18R1 2q11 All [2,4]\\nTSLP 5q22 All [2,4,12]\\nIL-13 5q31 European [2,3]\\nHLA-DQ/DR 6p21 All [2,3,12,13]\\nIL-33 9p24 All [2,4]\\nRORA 15q22 European [2]\\nSMAD3 15q23 European [2]\\nORMDL3/GSDML 17q21 All [1,2,4]', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 40}),\n"," Document(page_content='23 Genetics and Asthma\\na GWAS in populations of African ancestry identified poly -\\nmorphisms in the α-1B-adrenergic receptor ( ADRA1B ), the \\nprion-related protein (PRNP), and dipeptidyl peptidase 10 \\n(DPP10 ) as predictors of asthma risk.9 DPP10  had also origi -\\nnally been identified as an asthma gene through positional \\ncloning in European families.10 Ancestry association testing \\nalso recently identified a common European genetic variant \\non chromosome 6q14 as a risk factor for asthma in African \\nAmerican subjects with local European admixture (odds \\nratio = 2.2).11\\nGenome-wide screens for asthma risk in Asian adults and \\nchildren identified genetic variants in the MHC/human leu -\\nkocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6p21. In the \\nJapanese population, 7,171 adult asthma cases and 27,912 \\nunaffected individuals were genotyped in the discovery and \\nreplication cohorts. Five loci were associated with suscepti -\\nbility to adult asthma at the genome-wide significance level, \\nincluding the previously identified HLA region and the thy -\\nmic stromal lymphopoietin/WD repeat domain 36 ( TSLP /\\nWDR36 ) regions, and three additional genomic regions: the \\nubiquitin-specific peptidase 38/GRB2-associated binding \\nprotein 1 ( USP38/GAB1 ) locus on chromosome 4q31, loci on \\nchromosome 10p14, and a region of chromosome 12q13.12 In \\na separate GWAS of childhood asthma, genetic variants in \\nthe HLA-DP  locus region on chromosome 6p21.3 were asso -\\nciated with the risk of pediatric asthma across Asian popula -\\ntions.13 Additionally, a replication study in 710 asthma cases \\nand 656 unaffected controls in the Chinese Han population \\nprovides further evidence that the ORMDL3/GSDMB  locus \\nis associated with asthma risk in multiple ethnic groups.14\\nThe specific role and functional biology of novel GWAS \\nloci such as ORMDL3  in the pathogenesis of asthma remain \\nunknown.

However, com -\\nprehensive studies of asthma severity require more intense, \\ntime-consuming, and costly phenotyping, often resulting \\nin smaller cohort sizes. An analysis of asthma severity can \\ninclude intermediate phenotypes, such as measures of pul -\\nmonary function, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), bio -\\nmarkers, and responses to asthma therapy. Genetic studies \\nof asthma severity also require different comparison groups than susceptibility studies: instead of unaffected individuals, \\nsubjects with severe asthma should be compared with indi -\\nviduals with mild asthma, which can be an additional com -\\nplexity for subject recruiting.

Because it was not clear \\nwhether these same genes or pathways were also important \\nin lung function variation in individuals with asthma, Li and \\ncolleagues performed a meta-analysis of 14 single nucleotide \\npolymorphisms (SNPs) in lung function candidate genes in \\nthree independent asthma cohorts.20 This analysis identi -\\nfied the HHIP /rs1512288  variant as a significant predictor \\nof FEV1 and FVC in asthma and an increasing number of \\nrisk variants in these lung function genes were highly associ -\\nated with lower FEV1 and increased asthma severity.20 This \\napproach demonstrates the close relationship between pul -\\nmonary function and asthma severity.\\nAnother gene that could influence asthma susceptibility \\nand severity is the interleukin 6 receptor ( IL-6R ), which was \\nidentified as a predictor of asthma risk in a GWAS of 57,800 \\nsubjects.21 A common IL-6R  coding variation ( Asp358Ala ) \\nwas identified as a genetic modifier of lung function in \\nasthma, as subjects of European ancestry with asthma who \\ninherited the Ala358  variant had the lowest mean percent \\npredicted FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, and the highest mean levels \\nof methacholine responsiveness.22 The functional character -\\nization of this gene in airway cells is ongoing and there is the \\npossibility that anti- IL-6R  therapy could also be important in \\nthe treatment of asthma and other airway diseases.\\nIn the first GWAS of longitudinal decline in FEV1 or \\nFEV1/FVC in several European cohorts, the associated \\ngenetic variants were different between individuals with \\nand without asthma. While none of the variants attained \\ngenome-wide significance, there was a replicated associa -\\ntion between the height-related gene deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 7 ( DLEU7 ) and an FEV1 decrease in individu -\\nals without asthma (discovery P = 4.8 × 10–6; replication \\nP = .03). The most significant association for a FEV1/FVC \\nratio decrease in asthma, tumor suppressor candidate 3 \\n(TUSC3 ; P = 5.3 × 10–8), was not replicated and variants that \\nwere associated with pulmonary function in cross-sectional \\nanalyses were not predictive of a decline (Table 3.2).23\\nThe importance of identifying gene variants that interact \\nwith lung function in asthma is that these genes appear to \\nrepresent an additional risk for future lung function decline \\nand asthma severity. It is possible that genotyping individu -\\nals with asthma earlier in the medical history of their dis -\\nease could identify these patients with asthma who have an \\nincreased risk of disease progression. This genetic informa -\\ntion could serve as a “predictive” biomarker and these at-risk \\nasthmatics may be candidates for more aggressive therapies \\nto prevent disease progression.\\nBIOMARKERS\\nBiomarkers such as serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels \\nand blood or sputum eosinophil levels may be important \\nin predicting the severity of asthma or the risk of exacer -\\nbations. Therefore, many asthma cohorts as well as large \\npopulation-based studies have evaluated the genetic fac -\\ntors related to these biomarkers (Table 3.2). The GABRIEL \\ncohort performed a GWAS for total serum IgE levels in 7087 \\nsubjects with asthma and 7667 controls, and identified one \\nnovel locus in the class II region of MHC, which was sig -\\nnificant at the genome-wide level.2 This study also observed \\nseveral genetic variants associated with IgE levels in the Fc \\nfragment of IgE, high affinity I ( FCER1A ), IL-13 , and signal \\ntransducer and activator of transcription 6 ( STAT6 ) genes. \\nThese genes were also observed in a GWAS of IgE in the \\ngeneral populations.24,25 In the GABRIEL study, genes that \\nwere associated with asthma susceptibility generally did not \\noverlap with those associated with IgE, though the authors \\nsuggest that loci strongly associated with IgE levels may con -\\ntribute to the severity or progression of the disease.2 In order \\nto identify IgE-associated genes in asthma populations, Li \\nand colleagues tested SNPs on chromosome 11q13.5 between \\nthe open reading frame 30 ( C11orf30 ) and leucine-rich repeat \\ncontaining 32 ( LRRC32 ) genes, which had previously been \\nidentified in genetic analyses of related inflammatory condi -\\ntions. Four SNPs in this region were significantly associated \\nwith total serum IgE levels after adjustment for multiple test -\\ning, signifying a common genetic regulation for IgE levels in \\natopic diseases.26\\nThe asthma genes identified through GWAS have also \\nbeen identified as predictors of blood eosinophil levels, an \\ninflammatory biomarker possibly related to asthma patho -\\ngenesis and progression. For example, a large population-\\nbased GWAS of 9392 subjects in Iceland identified variants \\nIL-1RL1 , WDR36 , and IL-33  that were associated with \\neosinophil counts and asthma.27 Several reports have asso -\\nciated the 5q22 genomic region, spanning the TSLP  and \\nWDR36  genes, with asthma,2,4 and it is also associated with ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 42}),\n"," Document(page_content='25 Genetics and Asthma\\nan allergic disorder characterized by excess eosinophils in \\nthe esophagus.28\\nASTHMA THERAPY AND PHARMACOGENETICS\\nOther genetic mechanisms that can produce more severe or \\ndifficult-to-manage asthma are the responses to asthma ther -\\napy. This section focuses on new developments in pharmaco -\\ngenetics research (Table 3.2).\\ncortIcostero Id (glucocort IcoId) pathway\\nGlucocorticoid steroids are currently the most common anti-\\ninflammatory asthma therapy. In most cases, the regular use \\nof corticosteroids is effective and reduces mortality due to \\nasthma. However, chronic corticosteroid use can result in \\nside effects and there is a subset of severe asthma patients \\nthat requires high doses of inhaled and oral corticosteroids to \\ncontrol their symptoms and asthma exacerbations.7,8 There is \\nalso a considerable variability in the response to inhaled corti -\\ncosteroids (ICS), which is likely to have a genetic component.\\nThe Hop protein (encoded by the stress-induced phospho -\\nprotein 1 [ STIP1 ] gene) is involved in the activation of the \\nglucocorticoid receptor and is a novel therapeutic target in \\nthe glucocorticoid pathway. In a pharmacogenetic analysis, \\nSTIP1  single nucleotide and haplotypic variation were related \\nto a FEV1 change in response to treatment with ICS. There \\nwas a heterogeneous response to corticosteroids, as approxi -\\nmately one-half of the STIP1  haplotypes was associated with \\na reduced ICS response and the other half was associated \\nwith a greater sensitivity to ICS.29\\nA recent GWAS by Tantisira and colleagues evaluated four \\nasthma treatment trials ( n = 935) to identify pharmacogenetic \\nassociations related to the response to inhaled glucocorticoids. \\nA significant, replicated association was found in two correlated \\nSNPs in the glucocorticoid-induced transcript 1 ( GLCCI1 ) \\ngene, which confer a lung function response to inhaled gluco -\\ncorticoids and reduced GLCCI1  expression. The overall mean \\n(± standard error) increase in FEV1 for ICS-treated subjects \\nhomozygous for the risk allele was significantly less than for \\nsubjects homozygous for the common allele (3.2 ± 1.6% vs. \\n9.4 ± 1.1%, respectively). This is an example of a replicated \\npharmacogenetic analysis with functional verification.30 In \\naddition, Tantisira et al. have also shown that a variation in the \\ncorticotrophin-releasing hormone receptor 1 gene ( CRHR1 ) is \\nassociated with an improved lung function response to corti -\\ncosteroids in three asthma clinical trial populations.31 Tantisira \\net al. found genetic variants in the T gene and correlated \\nregions associated with a FEV1 response to ICS in an addi -\\ntional GWAS in the NHLBI Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism \\nHealth Association-Asthma Resource Project.32\\nbeta2-adrenerg Ic pathway\\nBeta-adrenergic receptor agonists or beta-agonists are com -\\nmonly prescribed medications for the relief of broncho -\\nconstriction and symptom treatment in asthma. Several pharmacogenetic studies have explored whether functional \\nnonsynonymous Gly16Arg  and Gln27Glu  beta2-adrenergic \\nreceptor ( ADRB2 ) gene variants could explain the differ -\\nences in bronchodilator response among asthma patients or \\nidentify a subgroup of patients with a reduced response.33,34 \\nHowever, extensive resequencing35 of the ADRB2  locus in \\nAfrican Americans and non-Hispanic whites with asthma \\nrevealed additional rare ADRB2  polymorphisms, which \\nmay also play a role in the response to therapy. For example, \\nAfrican Americans with asthma and rare ADRB2  alleles \\ntreated with a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) demon -\\nstrated a greater percentage of sputum eosinophils when \\ncompared with those with common alleles (28% vs. 7%; \\nP = .02) or those with rare alleles not treated with LABA \\n(28% vs. 0.4%; P = .01).36 Additionally, non-Hispanic whites \\nwith rare ADRB2  alleles treated with LABA demonstrated a \\nsignificantly increased number of urgent care and emergency \\ndepartment visits for asthma in the past year.36 In a similar \\nanalysis among individuals with asthma treated with LABA, \\nindividuals with rare ADRB2  variants were more likely to \\nhave asthma-related hospitalizations in the past year and to \\nrequire systemic corticosteroid therapy.37 These results sug -\\ngest that rare and common gene variations modulate the \\nresponses to asthma therapy.\\nt-helper 2 p athway\\nThere are several novel asthma therapies currently under \\ndevelopment targeting molecules in the Th2 pathway. Two \\nclinical trials of these biologics identified specific population \\nsubgroups with improved therapeutic responses based on bio -\\nmarker levels or specific genotypes. Corren and colleagues \\nhypothesized that anti- IL-13  therapy would benefit asthma \\npatients with a baseline profile consistent with increased Th2 \\nactivity (based on the total IgE level and blood eosinophil \\ncounts).38 In a clinical trial of an IL-13  monoclonal antibody, \\nparticipant subgroups were prespecified according to their \\nTh2 status and serum periostin levels. In the overall trial, \\nthe mean increase in FEV1 was 5.5% higher in the anti- IL-13  \\ngroup than in the placebo group ( P = .02). However, among \\npatients in the high periostin or the high fraction of exhaled \\nnitric oxide (FeNO) subgroup, the increase from baseline \\nFEV1 was 8.2% higher in the anti- IL-13  group than in the \\nplacebo group.38\\nAdditionally, Wenzel and colleagues reported the results \\nfrom a clinical trial of pitrakinra, an anti-interleukin 4 ( IL-4) \\nreceptor antagonist. In an ICS-withdrawal, double-blind, \\nrandomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, 534 par -\\nticipants with uncontrolled, moderate to severe asthma were \\nrandomized to 1, 3, or 10 mg of pitrakinra or a placebo \\ntwice daily for a 12-week treatment period.39 Efficacy was \\nnot demonstrated in the overall study population; however, \\nSlager and coworkers showed statistically significant efficacy \\nin prespecified subpopulations including individuals with \\nthe GG genotype in IL-4 receptor ( IL-4R ) variant rs8832 . \\nIndividuals with this genotype demonstrated the greatest \\nrelative reduction in the incidence of asthma exacerbations ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 43}),\n"," Document(page_content='26 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nat the highest anti- IL-4R  dose compared with the placebo \\n(88%) and they also had decreased nocturnal awakenings \\nand activities limited by asthma. There was also a signifi -\\ncant dose-dependent reduction in exacerbations in these sub -\\njects as the frequency of exacerbations in the placebo and the \\n1, 3, and 10 mg treatment groups was 25%, 16%, 12%, and \\n3%, respectively.40 This study represents one of the largest \\nand most informative pharmacogenetic analysis of the Th2 \\npathway in patients with uncontrolled, moderate to severe \\nasthma.\\nIt is possible that certain biological pathways such as the \\nTh2 immunological pathway may be more active in individ -\\nuals with severe asthma. These examples are proof of the \\nconcept for personalized medicine that specific biologic ther -\\napies could be targeted at subgroups of asthma patients based \\non genotype or specific biomarkers, identifying an asthma \\nsubgroup with an improved response to therapy.\\nIssues such as statistical power, generalizability, and \\nphenotypic characterization that are critical for all genetic \\nstudies, are especially important in pharmacogenetic stud -\\nies. Identifying the appropriate replication populations also \\nremains a challenge, due to the highly specific treatment reg -\\nimens specified in clinical trials. An important step forward \\nin this field is that GWAS are now being carried out to iden -\\ntify novel genetic predictors of the ICS response and other \\noutcomes. Additionally, current pharmacogenetic analyses \\nalso represent an important step in personalized medicine, as \\nclinical decisions for asthma patients may rely on these types \\nof studies in the future.\\nGENE–ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS \\nAND EPIGENETICS\\nDespite the importance of environmental factors in the devel -\\nopment of asthma, very few gene–environment interactions in \\nasthma have been consistently characterized and replicated. \\nThe challenges in genetic association studies, such as ade -\\nquate statistical power, population stratification, gene cover -\\nage, and adjustment for false positives, can be compounded in \\ngene–environment interaction studies and accurately measur -\\ning environmental factors represents additional obstacles.41\\nTraditional gene–environment studies tested a candidate \\ngene or pathway interacting with a particular exposure for an \\nincreased risk of asthma development or severity. One of the \\nmost replicated interactions in asthma has been for the –159 \\npromoter variant of the CD14  gene, which encodes a subunit \\nof the endotoxin receptor found on mononuclear cells. Many \\nexposures have been studied for their interaction with this \\ngene, primarily demonstrating an asthma risk for exposed \\nsubjects with the –159T allele while the –159C allele is asso -\\nciated with asthma in nonexposed subjects.42\\nThere have also been several gene–environment studies \\nto evaluate the interaction between genes and tobacco smoke \\nexposure related to asthma risk, including a genetic linkage \\nanalysis in 200 Dutch families. Linkage signals for asthma \\nand BHR were observed on chromosomes 3p and 5q, though secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure accounted for BHR linkage \\nto 5q.43 Similar results were observed in U.S. families.44 There \\nhave also been reports of a gene–environment interaction \\nbetween SHS and genes in the chromosome 17q12-21 genomic \\nregion identified through GWAS.1,2,4 Two independent, prospec -\\ntive cohort studies in the Netherlands assessed the interaction \\nbetween rs2305480  genotype in the GSDML  gene and maternal \\nsmoking during pregnancy or early-life SHS exposure.45,46 This \\nvariant was associated with wheeze and shortness of breath in \\nchildren exposed to smoke during their fetal life ( P = .04) or \\nduring their early postnatal life ( P = 5.06  × 10–4).46 Variants in \\nthis genomic region also interact with active smoking to modu -\\nlate asthma and its related phenotypes.47\\nPerhaps even more challenging than a systematic and \\ncomprehensive evaluation of gene–environment interactions \\nis defining how environmental exposures lead to asthma \\nsusceptibility and progression. It is likely that epigenetic \\nmechanisms, such as methylation, regulate gene expression \\nin response to particular exposures, ultimately affecting the \\ndisease susceptibility and severity pathways. In many cases, \\nthese mechanisms have been studied in candidate gene and \\ngenomic repeat sequence regions. For instance, Breton and \\ncolleagues investigated the methylation status of specific \\ngenomic regions in a cohort of children exposed to maternal \\nsmoking compared with those not exposed. The offspring of \\nmothers who smoked during pregnancy had decreased meth -\\nylation of the AluYb8 repeat sequence, a marker of over -\\nall DNA hypomethylation. Additionally, smoking-induced \\neffects on the methylation of long interspersed repetitive ele -\\nments-1 (LINE1) were noted in children with the glutathione-\\nS-transferase mu 1 ( GSTM1 ) null genotype only,48 providing \\na putative mechanism for the interaction between epigenetic \\nmodulation and the asthma susceptibility candidate gene.\\nIn one of the few genome-wide interaction scans for \\nasthma and atopy, the GABRIEL study group tested genetic \\nvariants for their interaction with rural farm-related expo -\\nsures in 1708 unrelated European children.49 Overall, no sig -\\nnificant genome-wide interactions were identified, suggesting \\nthat common genetic polymorphisms may not modulate the \\ninfluence of the farming environment on childhood asthma, \\nalthough rare variants could play a role.49 This analysis also \\nemphasizes that new statistical and measurement tools are \\nneeded to address these issues on a genome-wide scale.41\\nDespite the obvious challenges involved in gene–environment \\ninteraction studies, these analyses may account for some of \\nthe unexplained “missing heritability” observed in genome-\\nwide scans of common diseases such as asthma. Interaction \\nstudies can also provide an insight into which environmental \\nexposures contribute to asthma severity and the risk of exac -\\nerbations and may guide future interventions.\\nDISCUSSION\\nSince the beginning of genome-wide studies in asthma, \\nseveral genes/chromosomal regions have been consistently \\nassociated with asthma susceptibility in multiple ethnic ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 44}),\n"," Document(page_content='27 Genetics and Asthma\\ngroups: ORMDL3/GSDMB , IL-33 , IL-1RL1 , RAD50 /IL-13 , \\nHLA-DR/DQ , TSLP , and SMAD3  (Table 3.1).1,2,4 In most \\ncases, the effect of each individual genetic variant is rela -\\ntively small, suggesting that the additive effect of multiple \\nrisk variants should be evaluated. An important goal of the \\ngenetic approach in a complex disease is to identify a group of \\nvariants that will reliably predict the risk of the development \\n(susceptibility) or progression (severity) of the disease. As the \\nvariants that contribute to susceptibility may not be the same \\nas those that contribute to severity, it is important to charac -\\nterize asthma disease heterogeneity, as different phenotypes \\nmay reflect several pathogenic pathways that have differ -\\nent underlying genetic architecture.8 Improved phenotyping \\napproaches will also improve our ability to link genotypes \\nand phenotypes. Genes that contribute to endophenotypes \\nsuch as lung function and biomarker levels provide insight \\ninto the mechanisms of asthma progression (Table 3.2).\\nFuture genetic studies in asthma severity will also incorpo -\\nrate whole-genome or exome-specific sequencing to identify \\nmore common and rare genetic variants. Exome and com -\\nplete genome sequencing will provide better genomic cov -\\nerage than existing genotyping platforms and will discover \\nbiologically relevant causal variants. For example, resequenc -\\ning the IL-4 gene in African Americans identified an excess \\nof private noncoding variants in asthma cases compared with \\nunaffected individuals.50 New genotyping technologies and \\ncomprehensive phenotyping should elucidate the genetics of \\nasthma severity in the future. Understanding the functional \\nbiology of these novel variants that were discovered through \\ngenome-wide sequencing and how they interact with the \\nenvironment will also become increasingly important. Using \\nthese variants that were identified in comprehensively pheno -\\ntyped studies, we may more effectively develop a personal -\\nized therapy for all individuals with asthma.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThis work was funded by NHLBI grants HL69167 and \\nHL101487.

Its het -\\nerogeneity is further complicated by time (natural variation \\nin disease activity) and therapy. The effect of these additional \\ndimensions is likely underestimated in cross-sectional stud -\\nies. A number of comorbidities are associated with chronic \\nasthma. These may represent both overlapping and unrelated \\npathologies that coexist to either mimic or exacerbate clinical \\nasthma symptoms. In common with other chronic diseases, \\nthe clinical expression of asthma is associated with a sig -\\nnificant and variable psychosocial component.3 This is fre -\\nquently overlooked and may be difficult to quantify. Finally, \\nthe heterogeneity in the response to asthma pharmacotherapy \\nis complex and multifactorial and an important component of \\nthe need for individualized therapy for patients with refrac -\\ntory asthma.\\nPROBLEMS ARISING FROM \\nASTHMA HETEROGENEITY\\nHeterogeneity is arguably the major intellectual limitation \\nto progress in our understanding of asthma.4 Perhaps one \\nof the greatest barriers to the characterization of the het -\\nerogeneity of asthma has been the success of glucocorticoid \\ntherapy in the management of asthma. Glucocorticoids con -\\nstitute a broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory therapies that \\nis effective in a large proportion of patients, irrespective of \\nthe underlying pathological processes. Nevertheless, the fail -\\nure of the effectiveness of conventional approaches is obvi -\\nous in the subgroup of patients with difficult asthma. In this \\ngroup, the heterogeneity is striking and the etiology of poor \\nclinical control is broad and multifactorial. A systematic \\napproach to the evaluation of these patients, together with \\na multidisciplinary and individualized management plan is \\nrecommended for optimizing care. More generally, there is \\nan ambition to provide personalized therapy for all asthma \\nsufferers.\\nFrom a scientific perspective, genetic and molecular \\nassociation studies necessarily require the study of popula -\\ntions that are homogeneous with respect to their underlying \\ndisease pathways. The heterogeneity in such study samples \\nincreases the likelihood of type II errors.

Increasingly, these subpopulations are \\ndescribed as phenotypes of asthma. In biology, a phenotype \\nis defined as “the observable properties of an organism aris -\\ning as a product of the interaction of their genotype with \\nthe environment.” Endophenotypes or endotypes are more \\nspecific and refer to discrete pathogenic pathways4 that, in \\ntheory, define a single disease process.dIstIngu IshIng phenotypes  and endotypes\\nThe difference between phenotypes and endotypes is not sim -\\nply a matter of semantics. The heterogeneity in asthma has \\ntwo key elements: (i) the existence of multiple pathological \\nentities (different endotypes) and (ii) the variable influences \\nexerted by the environment on the individual’s genotype \\n(variability within a single endotype). Fundamentally, efforts \\nto characterize the heterogeneity of asthma need to focus on \\nthe identification of endotypes. By definition, endotypes are \\nstable.

There is considerable interest and \\ninvestment in the search for novel biomarkers that may inform \\nasthma phenotypes. In this role, biomarkers must be detectable \\nin the presence of the disease and be independent of the disease \\nactivity and therefore the effects of therapy. However, biomark -\\ners to date have been developed to measure disease activity. \\nSputum eosinophils are one example.

From the discussion so far, the clinical drivers for char -\\nacterizing heterogeneity differ and may even be in conflict \\nwith the scientific ideal of discovering endotypes (Table 4.1). \\nFurthermore, discovering endotypes may require the utili -\\nzation of complex, sophisticated, and expensive techniques \\nthat are far removed from the bedside tests needed for imple -\\nmentation in clinical practice. It is therefore likely that the \\nevolution of the characterization of asthma will see the devel -\\nopment of parallel models for clinical and scientific purposes \\nthat may converge as the mechanisms of the disease are bet -\\nter understood (Figure 4.2).\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ASTHMA: \\nA HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE\\nThe history of asthma phenotypes provides a useful refer -\\nence point for illustrating the challenges that characterizing \\nthe heterogeneity of asthma presents and the strategies that \\nare being developed to overcome these challenges. The clas -\\nsification of different forms of asthma can be traced back to \\nthe seventeenth century when William Harvey suggested a \\ndistinction between asthma of bronchial and cardiac origins. \\nSince that time, there have been several important shifts in \\nthe ideology governing the diagnosis and classification of \\nasthma. In the nineteenth century, the recognition of “aller -\\ngic excitation” together with the development of skin testing \\ntechniques encouraged a very narrow perspective of asthma \\nas a disease that was necessarily associated with and pre -\\ncipitated by allergies, verifiable with skin testing. Through \\nthe diligent collection of case records, Rackemann clearly \\nillustrated the absence of an identifiable allergic trigger in \\na large proportion of cases with clinical asthma.5 He sug -\\ngested a number of other associations that were significant \\nfor this group and, on this basis, he proposed a model for \\nasthma classification. In his paper describing intrinsic asthma, Rackemann6 summarizes this change to a broader \\nperspective:\\nIn the beginning all was allergy that wheezed, and if the \\nmethods peculiar to allergy could not reveal the cause, these \\nmethods were deemed faulty. It was recognised, however, \\nthat the simple allergic process could be aggravated and \\ncontinued by secondary infections. Still later, primary infec -\\ntions came to be regarded as the cause of asthma …\\nA natural consequence of a more inclusive approach to \\nthe diagnosis of asthma has been the greater heterogeneity \\nthat clinicians have sought to classify in a variety of ways \\n(Table 4.1). The following overview illustrates a number of \\nimportant points:\\n 1. Classification was performed by clinicians with \\na consequent emphasis on clinically relevant \\nparameters .\\n 2. Classification was subjective  and based on factors \\nthat the investigator deemed important.\\n 3. Classification was usually based on a single aspect  \\nof the disease. A single determinant therefore \\ndefined the structure of each model and, unsur -\\nprisingly, different parameters yielded models that \\nshared little in common.\\nPRINCIPLES OF CHARACTERIZING \\nHETEROGENEITY: LESSONS FROM BIOLOGY\\nThe reference to phenotypes of asthma is recent and significant \\nas it acknowledges the increasing application of the taxonomic \\nprinciples of biology classification. In brief, biological taxon -\\nomy is founded on the principle that the greater the number \\nof shared characteristics between two organisms, the greater \\nthe probability that a biological relationship exists between \\nthem. A detailed physical characterization or “phenotyping” \\nis therefore a core element of this process. Classification or \\ntaxonomy refers to the construction of models for placing phe -\\nnotypes in a manner that informs their underlying relation -\\nships. Characterizing the heterogeneity is therefore a two-step \\nprocess of phenotyping  and classification .\\nBoth phenotypes and classification models may change on \\nthe basis of the information gathered or available, new diag -\\nnostic techniques, and the goals that are defined. Such changes \\nare influenced by advances in scientific understanding, and \\nthe taxonomy of any system should therefore be viewed as a \\ndynamic process. The history of biological taxonomy illus -\\ntrates this well. Although the methodological principle of \\ngrouping by observable characteristics was retained, its scope \\nbroadened over time with the development of a numerical tax -\\nonomy in the mid-twentieth century,7 which used computer-\\nbased mathematical algorithms (cluster analysis) to measure \\nthe “evolutionary distance” between organisms on the basis of \\nconsiderably larger numbers of recorded characteristics.

First, it incorporates \\na broader spectrum of observable characteristics, increasing the likelihood of identifying meaningful (biological) rela -\\ntionships. Secondly, it defines each phenotype on the basis of \\nthe relationship expressed between different domains of the \\ndisease rather than the absolute expression of a single aspect \\nof the disease. In biological terms, examining relationships \\nbetween domains is likely to better delineate the underlying \\nprocesses and pathways. Additionally, this will be associated \\nwith greater phenotypic stability. As an example, “none -\\nosinophilic asthma” (discussed further later) may indicate \\neither a distinct phenotype or eosinophilic asthma with good \\ninflammatory control. The two are indistinguishable on the \\nbasis of inflammatory characteristics alone. The inclusion of \\nclinical symptom expression as a characteristic may distin -\\nguish these groups by revealing concordance of expression \\n(few symptoms) with well-controlled eosinophilic asthma, \\nand discordance with the true noneosinophilic phenotype. \\nFurthermore, such a system would correctly classify poorly \\ncontrolled eosinophilic asthma (high levels of eosinophilic \\ninflammation + high symptoms) together with well-con -\\ntrolled eosinophilic asthma (noneosinophilic + few symp -\\ntoms) as the same phenotype across a spectrum of severity.\\nMultIvarIate techn Iques used In asthMa: \\ncluster  analys Is and factor  analys Is\\nThe past decade has witnessed an increasing use of factor \\nanalysis and cluster analysis as multivariate techniques for Clinical go alsS cientiﬁc go als\\nPhenot ype-speciﬁc appr oach to management :\\n–Inform risk and prognosi s\\n–Inform resp onse to individual therapie s,\\nenabling patient sp eciﬁc prescriptions\\nEasily me asured variable s\\nWidespread availability\\nChea pIdenti fy distinc t disease entities ( endot ypes):\\n–I dentif y endoty pe-speciﬁc biomar kers\\n–I dentif y patholo gical mole cules to\\nunderstand me chanisms of dise ase\\n–I dentif y and isolate candidate genes of\\ndisease and susceptibility\\nPermits a complex and s ophisticat ed approach\\nIdenti fy speciﬁc/sensitive biomarkers\\nAdapt for commercial/clinical us e\\nSing le cla ssiﬁcation mo del/T_he clinical phenoty pe infor ms \\nscientiﬁc inve stigation\\n        Apply to clinical phenotypes\\nFIGURE 4.2  The dynamics of asthma classification.

Although conceptually \\nsimilar, the two groups of techniques differ in the algorithms \\nthat they employ, with implications for their respective suit -\\nability to different classification tasks. Both seek to identify \\npatterns within data and these patterns inform the likely \\nunderlying structure of the data that forms the basis of their \\nclassification. Each group of techniques comprises a number \\nof algorithms that differ in the mathematical rules govern -\\ning pattern recognition and classification processes. This can \\nlead to considerable variability in the interpretation of the \\ndata structure. An understanding of the underlying principles \\nof these techniques is therefore a necessary prerequisite for \\ntheir appropriate use in research practice.\\nfactor  analys Is\\nOverview\\nFactor analysis includes a group of algorithms that are pri -\\nmarily used to identify patterns of variability and the correla -\\ntion between variables within a data set. In brief, variables \\nthat group together are represented by a factor, which is \\nmathematically the vectorial sum of the contributions from \\neach component variable. The factor, therefore, represents a \\nweighted sum of data from all the grouping variables, and \\nmay be used in place of the individual variables in a further \\nanalysis without a significant loss of information (Figure 4.3).\\nMethodology\\nFactor analysis techniques use a two-step algorithm to clas -\\nsify patterns of expression (Figure 4.3). The first step is pri -\\nmarily a data reduction step. In this step, a factor “axis” is \\nconstructed that maximizes the representation of the com -\\nmon variability within the data (in effect, linear regression). \\nA second factor is then constructed to specifically account for \\nthe variability that is not included in the first step. This factor \\nis, therefore, mathematically independent of the first and will \\nbe represented geometrically by an axis that is perpendicular \\nto the first factor axis. Iterations continue until all of the vari -\\nability within the data set is accounted for by independent \\nfactors. The second step of the algorithm is an optimization \\nstep. The factor axes are rotated to maximize their represen -\\ntation of the variability for groups of variables rather than the \\nwhole data set. With rotation, the relationships between each \\nfactor axis and the individual variables will change; however, \\nthe proportion of variance of the data set accounted for by the \\nfactor remains constant. Rotation is important for changing \\nthe emphasis of the factors from a data reduction model that \\nis representative of the whole data set to a structural model in \\nwhich individual factors define the clustering variables. The \\nrotated factor solution is believed to yield “invariant factors,” \\nthat is, the factor model is less sensitive to the removal or the \\naddition of one or a few data set items.\\nUses\\nThe main uses of factor analysis are data reduction and the \\nidentification of groups of variables sharing related patterns \\nof expression. Data reduction is invaluable to help overcome the problems associated with the application of classical \\nstatistical tests to complex data sets. This is achieved using \\neither the factor score for each factor (weighted sum of the \\ncontribution of all variables to the factor) or a single repre -\\nsentative variable (with a high loading coefficient to the fac -\\ntor, implying a majority contribution to the factor score) for \\nfurther analysis. As a technique that identifies relationships \\nbetween groups of variables, factor analysis makes statistical \\ninferences that can contribute to identifying and understand -\\ning underlying mechanisms and processes. However, the \\nrelationships defined by factor analysis are mathematical and \\nnot biological. The identified patterns are hypothesis gener -\\nating  and can help direct further study; factor analysis should \\nnot be used in isolation to draw biological conclusions.\\nApplication in Asthma\\nThe properties of factor analysis make it a powerful tool for \\ncharacterizing heterogeneity. A large number of measurable \\ncharacteristics are routinely recorded as part of a clinical \\nassessment of asthma. Yet, little is known about the relation -\\nship and redundancy that exist between these variables and \\nwhether the information that is gathered may be organized \\nin a structured manner. Factor analysis lends itself to tack -\\nling these questions. Rosi and colleagues9 performed a factor \\nanalysis of eight measured characteristics recorded in 99 con -\\nsecutive patients with asthma. The authors identified three \\nfactors associated with the eight measurements and, based on \\nthe loading patterns, these factors could be identified as being \\nrepresentative of lung function (FEV1, FVC, inspiratory vital \\ncapacity [IVC]); airway dysfunction (bronchodilator revers -\\nibility, airway hyperresponsiveness); and eosinophilic air -\\nway inflammation (sputum eosinophils, eosinophil cationic \\nprotein [ECP]), respectively. Conceptually, the factor model \\npresents a view of the independent components or domains \\nthat make up the clinical phenotype of asthma.\\ncluster  analys Is\\nOverview\\nCluster analysis  is a generic term for a broad range of numer -\\nical methods that is designed primarily to identify groups or \\nclusters of homogeneous observations within heterogeneous \\nmultivariate data sets.10 In mathematical terms, a cluster \\nrefers to a collection of items that exhibits “internal cohe -\\nsion” (within-group homogeneity) and “external isolation” \\n(between-group separation). Cluster analysis algorithms are \\ndesigned to fulfill both conditions. Whereas factor analy -\\nsis classifies the patterns of expression of variables , cluster \\nanalysis is more appropriately utilized to perform the clas -\\nsification of the population  based on patterns of expression \\nfor specified variables.\\nMethodology\\nCluster analysis techniques are broadly of two types: (i) \\nhierarchical and (ii) nonhierarchical or optimization cluster -\\ning techniques. Broadly speaking, clustering techniques fol -\\nlow a two-step algorithm. The first step involves quantifying ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n"," Document(page_content='36 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nthe similarity between cases. This is a geometrical distance \\nin space. The second step involves placing cases into groups \\non the basis of their measured similarity. Group allocation is \\nan iterative process (Figure 4.3). Similarity may be defined \\non the basis of one (monothetic) or several (polythetic) vari -\\nables and is generally measured as the geometric distance \\nbetween two cases plotted in space. Several geometric mea -\\nsures of distance are available with differing influences on \\nthe outcome. For polythetic clustering, the number of vari -\\nables used determines the dimensionality of the distance \\ncalculation; this calculation assumes that all dimensions \\nare statistically independent. An increasing dimensionality \\nrequires larger sample sizes to identify the cluster structure, \\nand Formann11 suggests a minimum sample size of 2k, where \\nk is the number of variables used for clustering. Within the families of hierarchical and nonhierarchical cluster analysis, \\nvarious algorithms exist that differ according to the math -\\nematical functions that are used for measuring similarity \\nand grouping cases into clusters.

Variability is also compounded by \\ndifferences in the composition of the populations sampled. \\nThe results obtained in a single population would require \\nreplication at other centers for validation.\\nconclus Ions\\nDespite the limitations, factor and cluster analyses offer a \\nnovel approach for tackling the complexity of asthma het -\\nerogeneity. The two groups of methods provide complemen -\\ntary information and may be used in tandem: factor analysis \\ncan be used to define the distinct domains or dimensions that \\nmake up the asthma phenotype and cluster analysis may be \\nused to study distinct patterns of domain coexpression in the \\nasthma population (Figure 4.3).\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ASTHMA \\nAND RECOGNIZED PHENOTYPES\\noverv Iew\\nStudies suggest that asthma phenotypes may differ between \\nadults and children. Many phenotypes of childhood wheeze \\ndo not progress to asthma and are not considered further \\nhere. True endotypes of asthma are yet to be characterized. \\nThe most likely candidates are phenotypes described on the \\nbasis of defined triggers. For these, one may hypothesize a \\nclear genetic susceptibility to the trigger that is associated \\nwith the clinical manifestation of the disease and this rela -\\ntionship is invariant of time and therapy. Although they are \\nnot endotypes of the disease, molecular associations with the \\nresponse to specific therapies have been identified. Targeted \\ngene studies have identified polymorphisms of the beta2-\\nadrenoceptor as being associated with the heterogeneity in \\nthe response to short-acting beta-agonists but not long-acting \\nbeta-agonists,14 and polymorphisms of the 5-lipoxygenase biosynthetic and receptor pathway are associated with a dif -\\nferential response to montelukast.15\\nThere is some debate about whether severe asthma consti -\\ntutes a phenotype of asthma. In some ways, this is analogous \\nto the argument of whether old age is a phenotype of man. \\nLike age, severity is a descriptive term applied to qualify \\nphenotypic expression, with no independent significance \\nfor examining phylogenetic relationships. However, old age \\nhas prognostic importance and may help inform the factors \\nassociated with the mechanisms of aging. Similarly, severe \\nasthma is prognostically significant and further, it is pro -\\nposed that specific genetic factors associated with “severity” \\nmay only be identified by characterizing severe asthma as a \\nphenotype.4\\nPhenotyping on the basis of asthma outcomes is also an \\napproach that has been used. From a methodological view -\\npoint, outcomes should be a product of, and be predicted by \\nthe phenotype. It remains a matter of debate whether work -\\ning backward in this way is correct. Nevertheless, outcomes \\nhave an accepted objective definition that provides a suitable \\nreference for classification and are clinically relevant to con -\\nstruct models that inform risk associations.\\nThe current literature identifies a number of phenotypes \\nof adult asthma, which were characterized using both single- \\nand multidimensional approaches. Here, we discuss the \\nmost influential phenotypes in current practice that have \\nbeen recognized and validated by studies in a number of dif -\\nferent populations using different approaches. The relation -\\nship between different phenotypes is complex (Figure\\xa04.4). \\nAlthough multidimensional phenotypes frequently identify \\nmore homogeneous subgroups of larger unidimensional \\nphenotypes, independent phenotypes may be recognized in \\nthis way.\\nunIdIMensIonal class IfIcatIon: \\nInfla MMatory  phenotypes  of asthMa\\nEosinophilic Asthma\\nEosinophilic airway inflammation was one of the earliest \\nrecognized pathological characteristics of asthma. Although \\npreviously considered the primary pathological disturbance \\nin all cases of asthma, noneosinophilic variants of asthma \\nare now widely recognized (discussed later). Consequently, \\neosinophilic asthma is more appropriately considered an \\nimportant disease phenotype with distinct clinical properties.\\nDefinition of Phenotype\\nEosinophilic asthma is defined by the demonstration of \\ngreater than normal eosinophil numbers in the lower air -\\nways. This is quantified in population-based studies using \\nthe noninvasive technique of sputum induction as >2% of \\nthe viable sputum cell count.16 Eosinophilic inflamma -\\ntion is effectively ameliorated with glucocorticoid therapy \\n(see later).

In this context, it may itself \\nbe viewed as a biomarker of a broader phenotype of “Th2-\\ndriven” asthma. At a molecular level, IL-5-driven eosinophilic \\ninflammation is accompanied by the upregulation of other \\nTh2 cytokines, classically IL-4 (B-cell isotype switching to \\nIgE) and IL-13 (airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus cell \\nhypersecretion). Indeed, the expression of three genes induc -\\nible with IL-13 ( POSTN , CLCA1 , and SERPINB2 ) has been \\nutilized to provide molecular validation of the Th2 pheno -\\ntype.17 However, the significant heterogeneity in the coexpres -\\nsion of Th2 cytokines is increasingly recognized, suggesting \\nthat eosinophilic asthma itself is not an endotype. This is sup -\\nported by the differences in clinical expression: eosinophilic \\nbronchitis, a disease characterized by eosinophilic airway \\ninflammation without airway hyperresponsiveness typically \\nexpresses IL-5 but not IL-1318; among patients with airway \\nhyperresponsiveness, subgroups with high and low IgE titers \\nare well recognized, contributing to the characterization of \\nother important asthma phenotypes described here.\\nImportant Clinical Characteristics\\nEosinophilic Inflammation and Response to Glucocorticoid \\nTherapy  A number of studies have reported the presence of \\nunderlying eosinophilic airway inflammation to be a critical determinant of the clinical responsiveness to glucocorticoid \\ntherapy.19 Moreover, this pattern of responsiveness has been \\nreported in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)20 \\nand also in subjects without a specific respiratory diagnosis, \\npresenting with new symptoms of airways disease.21 In this \\ncontext, eosinophilic inflammation may be viewed as a phe -\\nnotypic determinant for airways disease more generally.\\nEosinophilic Airway Inflammation and Severe \\nExacerbations  A consistent and compelling body of evi -\\ndence supports an association between the extent of eosino -\\nphilic airway inflammation, quantified with sputum induction \\nand the pathogenesis of severe exacerbations. There are two \\naspects to this:\\n 1. Uncontrolled eosinophilic inflammation predates \\nsevere exacerbation events and may be used as a \\nbiomarker of risk to guide therapy.

Eosinophils have an effector role in the pathogen -\\nesis of severe exacerbations. Targeted, specific \\nanti-eosinophil therapies may be effective for pre -\\nventing severe exacerbations in patients with severe \\neosinophilic asthma. Two recently conducted stud -\\nies reported a significant (~50%) reduction in exac -\\nerbation frequency following treatment with the \\nanti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, mepolizumab, a \\nspecific anti-eosinophil therapy, in patients with \\nsevere asthma of an eosinophilic phenotype.27,28 \\nImportantly, early studies with mepolizumab that \\nwere not confined to eosinophilic asthma failed to \\nidentify a similar clinical benefit,29 underlining the \\nimportance of phenotype-driven patient selection \\nfor drug trials of specific molecular therapies.\\nBiomarkers of the Phenotype\\nTwo biomarkers of eosinophilic asthma have been widely \\nutilized in both research and clinical settings: (i) the sputum \\neosinophil count, obtained with sputum induction; and (ii) \\nthe fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). Of these, the spu -\\ntum eosinophil count is widely accepted as the gold standard \\nwith the strongest evidence base. FeNO is used as a surrogate \\nfor sputum eosinophils but it may be raised in several con -\\nditions that are not necessarily associated with eosinophilic \\nairway inflammation.30 Although a less specific biomarker of \\nthe eosinophilic phenotype, FeNO has comparable utility as a \\nmarker of the clinical response to glucocorticoid therapy,31,32 \\nwith effectiveness in longitudinal studies of asthma manage -\\nment for guiding the titration of corticosteroid doses.33 In \\ncontrast, only sputum eosinophil counts have been reliably \\nshown to guide corticosteroid therapy for reducing the fre -\\nquency of severe asthma exacerbations.34 These findings may \\nbe in keeping with the view that eosinophils have a more \\ndirect effector role in the pathogenesis of exacerbations while \\nglucocorticoid responsiveness is more closely associated with \\nTh2 activity per se that is reliably informed by FeNO. Recent \\ndata suggest that the blood eosinophil count may be a reli -\\nable biomarker for predicting the response to mepolizumab \\nand could be used to identify the phenotype in this context.35\\nNoneosinophilic Asthma\\nDefinition\\nThe accepted criteria for diagnosing noneosinophilic asthma \\ninclude: (i) the presence of typical symptoms; (ii) the objec -\\ntive evidence of significant variable airflow obstruction or \\nairway hyperresponsiveness; (iii) the consistent absence of \\nsputum eosinophilia; and (iv) the exclusion of an alternative diagnosis.36 The phenotype of noneosinophilic asthma is \\nconfounded significantly by anti-inflammatory asthma ther -\\napy. Cross-sectional population studies using sputum induc -\\ntion have reported normal sputum eosinophil counts (cutoff \\n<1.9%) in up to 25% of patients with untreated  symptomatic \\nasthma37 and in over 50% of patients (cutoff <2.5%) treated \\nwith high doses of inhaled corticosteroids.38 In a survey of \\nseveral asthma studies reporting inflammatory cell counts \\nusing either induced sputum or bronchoscopic methods, 49% \\nof the participants with asthma had a noneosinophilic ( <2% \\neosinophils) phenotype.39\\nA significant limitation of the point prevalence figures for \\nnoneosinophilic asthma based on cross-sectional studies is \\nthe absence of information on the longitudinal stability of \\nthe phenotype. However, studies have identified the none -\\nosinophilic phenotype in subjects with symptomatic asthma \\nnot receiving glucocorticoid therapy40 and it has also been \\na stable finding during the serial evaluation of subjects fol -\\nlowed longitudinally, both during scheduled visits41 and at \\nthe time of exacerbation.42\\nPathology\\nNoneosinophilic asthma defines a heterogeneous pheno -\\ntype of cellular profiles in sputum that are broadly catego -\\nrized43 as: (i) neutrophilic (sputum neutrophil count >61%) \\nand (ii) paucigranulocytic (no dominant cell type). It has \\nbeen suggested that the different inflammatory profiles are \\ndue to the different patterns of antigen exposure in the air -\\nways.44 Neutrophil-predominant inflammation is thought to \\nbe driven primarily by innate and cell-mediated immune \\nresponses. Numerous etiological factors are believed to \\nevoke responses along these immune pathways, particularly \\nthrough the direct activation of macrophages.45 Important \\nexamples include endotoxins, viral and bacterial infections, \\nthe constituents of cigarette smoke, and many occupational \\nagents. While useful, this model is likely to be an oversim -\\nplification. There is an increasing recognition of consider -\\nable cross talk between the Th1 and Th2 pathways, with \\ncytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF α) play -\\ning an important role in the augmentation of both types of \\nimmunity. Thus, although a viral etiology is identified most \\noften during asthma exacerbations,46 the pattern of airway \\ninflammation (either eosinophilic or noneosinophilic) is far \\nmore heterogeneous, but it is reported to exhibit within-\\nsubject consistency at successive exacerbation episodes.42 \\nIt is therefore likely that eosinophilic and noneosinophilic \\nphenotypes differ not only in their pattern of exposure and \\ntheir susceptibility to specific antigens but also in the type \\nof responses they evoke to a given antigen. It is also worth \\nremembering that the noneosinophilic phenotype does \\nnot necessarily imply a non-Th2 process. A phenotype of \\nsymptom-predominant asthma reported by Haldar et al. was \\ncharacterized by early-onset atopic disease (high IgE titers) \\nwithout sputum eosinophilia.47 Moreover, the prevalence \\nof a noneosinophilic phenotype of Th2 asthma is likely to \\nincrease as the exogenous blockade of IL-5 activity with \\nspecific anti-eosinophil therapies becomes available.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 57}),\n"," Document(page_content='40 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nImportant Clinical Characteristics\\nImpaired Response to Glucocorticoid Therapy  As a \\ncorollary to the observations in eosinophilic asthma, none -\\nosinophilic asthma is associated with an impaired clinical \\nresponse to glucocorticoid therapy48 and such treatment \\ndoes not modify the exacerbation risk. Much of the morbid -\\nity associated with refractory asthma is attributable to the \\nside effects of high-dose glucocorticoid therapy and a clear \\nimplication of these observations is that identifying the none -\\nosinophilic phenotype can help to identify a group in which \\nglucocorticoids may be safely titrated down. This view is \\nsupported by the findings of a post hoc  analysis by Haldar \\net al., which demonstrated that a strategy of glucocorticoid \\ntherapy titrated to the sputum eosinophil count achieved a \\nsignificant reduction in the daily dose of regular glucocor -\\nticoid therapy (mean reduction 1829 mcg beclometasone \\ndipropionate [BDP] equivalent) for patients with uncon -\\ntrolled noneosinophilic asthma, without adversely affecting \\nasthma control, compared with a traditional symptom-driven \\nalgorithm of care.45\\nMacrolide Therapy for Neutrophilic Asthma The neu -\\ntrophilic subtype of noneosinophilic asthma shares immu -\\nnopathological characteristics with other forms of airways \\ndisease, including bronchiectasis and COPD. Macrolides \\nhave been identified as modulators of innate immunity \\nand have been shown to lower the burden of neutrophilic \\ninflammation.49 In practice, this may improve the clinical \\noutcomes as pilot studies suggest benefits in patients with \\nbronchiectasis.50\\nBiomarkers of the Phenotype\\nThere are no specific biomarkers to identify noneosinophilic \\nasthma. In contrast with its uncertain positive predictive \\nvalue, a low FeNO level is a useful biomarker in clinical prac -\\ntice for identifying patients that are unlikely to benefit from \\nglucocorticoid treatment.21\\nMultIdIMensIonal phenotypes  of asthMa\\nOverview\\nIn addition to the pattern of airway inflammation, aspects of \\nthe disease that appear to contribute significantly to the clin -\\nical phenotypes of asthma include: (i) age of disease onset, \\n(ii) variability of airflow obstruction, (iii) gender, and (iv) \\nBMI. All or some of these phenotypic domains in different \\ncombinations have been included in different asthma popu -\\nlations using multivariate techniques to define phenotypes. \\nSome studies have also included postbronchodilator FEV1 \\nin their analyses to identify the phenotypes associated with \\nfixed airflow obstruction as a specific end point.51 Although \\nstrongly associated with the recognized phenotypes of \\nasthma, the atopic status was not a significant independent \\ndeterminant of phenotypic structure in either mild to mod -\\nerate or more severe asthma.47,51 It is likely that the atopic \\nstatus correlates with the age of onset, with the latter having \\na more dominant effect.Early-Onset Atopic Asthma\\nFeatures\\nThis phenotype is characterized by onset in childhood (usu -\\nally <12 years) and has a strong association with allergen \\nsensitization and related atopic diseases, typically allergic \\nrhinitis and eczema. This is the classical asthma phenotype \\nand is synonymous with the phenotype of “extrinsic asthma” \\ncharacterized by Rackemann.5 This is the most prevalent \\nphenotype of asthma, particularly in groups with mild to \\nmoderate disease. Indeed, the identification of this acknowl -\\nedged phenotype using unsupervised multivariate mathemat -\\nical techniques has been argued to validate their role in this \\nfield.47\\nPathology\\nThe association of this phenotype with atopy is supported \\nby the finding of high IgE titers and eosinophilic airway \\ninflammation, implying a pathology driven by Th2 immune \\npathways.\\nClinical Characteristics\\nIn a cross-sectional analysis, it has been suggested that \\nsignificant concordance exists between the level of under -\\nlying eosinophilic airway inflammation and the clinical \\nsymptoms for this group. Thus, a traditional symptom-led \\napproach to asthma pharmacotherapy is likely to be effec -\\ntive in this group and is probably the reason for the persis -\\ntence with and the success of such algorithms in clinical \\npractice.\\nAllergen exposure is thought to play an important role in \\ndriving the disease pathology. Although allergen avoidance \\nstudies have shown a variable effect on asthma control, it \\nremains uncertain how effective strategies to exclude ubiq -\\nuitous allergens from daily life can be best achieved and \\nsustained. Importantly, omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody \\nagainst IgE, currently remains the only specific molecular \\ntherapy that is approved for use in asthma. The treatment \\neligibility for this drug requires that specific criteria be \\nmet, which generally place candidates within this asthma \\nphenotype.\\nLate-Onset Eosinophilic Asthma\\nFeatures\\nThis phenotype is characterized by onset in adulthood. \\nPatients have eosinophilic airway inflammation without evi -\\ndence of atopic associations, and serum IgE titers are often \\nnormal or low. Severe asthma of this phenotype has been \\nassociated with nasal polyps and recurrent sinopulmonary \\ninfections.52 This form occurs more frequently in females \\nand overlaps with the historical phenotype of Samter’s triad \\n(nasal polyps, severe asthma, and aspirin sensitivity), or aspi -\\nrin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). A male “inflam -\\nmation-predominant” form of late eosinophilic asthma has \\nalso been described and is characterized by a relative paucity \\nof symptoms in the presence of severe eosinophilic airway \\ninflammation.44', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 58}),\n"," Document(page_content='41 Endotypes and Asthma\\nPathology\\nIn contrast with the early-onset phenotype, late-onset \\neosinophilic asthma forms a heterogeneous group. A low \\nIgE titer and the absence of an association with aller -\\ngic triggers suggest that differences with the early-onset \\nphenotype are likely in patterns of Th2 cytokine expres -\\nsion. Interestingly, the inflammation-predominant form \\ndescribed in males shares the demographic characteristics \\nof idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Whether \\nsome cases of inflammation-predominant asthma overlap \\nwith a mild form of single-organ HES is not known, but it \\nprovides a mechanism for the discordant expression of Th2 \\ncytokines.\\nClinical Characteristics\\nSevere forms of late-onset eosinophilic asthma can exhibit \\nconsiderable resistance to treatment, requiring high doses \\nof maintenance oral glucocorticoids to retain control. The \\navoidance of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflamma -\\ntory drugs should be advised, particularly if nasal polyposis \\nis identified or there is a history of chronic sinusitis. As men -\\ntioned earlier, there may be significant discordance between \\nthe symptoms and the level of eosinophilic inflammation. \\nPoor perception of bronchoconstriction and an abnormal \\nchemoreceptor response to hypoxia53 are factors that are \\nassociated with severe eosinophilic airway inflammation and \\nmay be relevant in this group. Symptom-guided therapy may \\nunderestimate the disease activity, with the consequent risk \\nof severe or life-threatening exacerbations and an inflamma -\\ntion-guided approach, as described earlier, has been shown \\nto significantly lower the frequency of severe exacerbation \\nevents.47\\nObesity-Related Asthma\\nFeatures\\nAlthough a relationship between obesity and asthma has \\nbeen proposed, the application of multivariate techniques has \\nenabled the formal recognition of this phenotype in multiple \\ncohorts. The phenotype is characterized by late-onset (adult) \\nasthma in predominantly female patients with a high BMI \\n(usually >35 kg/m2). This phenotype is distinct from early-\\nonset asthma progressing to adulthood in patients with a high \\nBMI. The former is usually noneosinophilic and is associ -\\nated with a high burden of symptoms but only modest airway \\ninflammation and preserved lung function.\\nPathology\\nThe mechanism of obesity-related asthma is unclear. The \\nmechanical effects of a high BMI are likely to contribute to \\nthe expression of symptoms. A relationship between BMI \\nand airway hyperresponsiveness has been reported.54 The \\nspecific association of this phenotype with the female gen -\\nder suggests that hormonal factors may play a role. Obesity \\nis recognized to be a proinflammatory state; however, stud -\\nies examining the relationship between airway inflammation \\nand BMI have failed to identify a significant association.55Clinical Characteristics\\nIn the absence of significant eosinophilic airway inflamma -\\ntion, escalating doses of glucocorticoids to treat the symp -\\ntoms of this phenotype should be avoided because they are \\nlikely to be ineffective (noneosinophilic phenotype) and may \\npromote further weight gain. Studies report an improvement \\nin asthma-related symptoms that correlates with the mag -\\nnitude of the weight loss that is achieved. This is likely to \\nreflect an improvement in respiratory mechanics as well as \\nbetter fitness levels. Interestingly, weight loss has been shown \\nto promote Th2 immune pathways56 and this may be associ -\\nated with greater responsiveness to conventional glucocorti -\\ncoid pharmacotherapy.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThe systematic characterization of asthma heterogeneity is \\ncritical for furthering our understanding of the important \\npathological determinants that may eventually inform the \\ndevelopment and delivery of personalized asthma treatment \\nplans for all. In this chapter, we have explored and discussed \\nthe multidimensional complexity of asthma heterogeneity \\nand the rationale of the strategies that are being developed \\nto address this heterogeneity. More generally, promoting a \\nmultidisciplinary “systems approach” that brings together \\ndiverse expertise with a common objective is likely to be \\neffective.\\nREFERENCES\\n 1. Rackemann F.

These guides are generally considered useful to synthe -\\nsize current knowledge and propose to the clinician what is \\nconsidered to be the optimal management of asthma based \\non the available evidence. Their production process has been \\nimproved in the last decade, and new methods have been \\ndeveloped to ensure high-quality, evidence-based reports \\nproposing unbiased recommendations. However, the imple -\\nmentation of these guidelines is still suboptimal and barriers \\nand facilitators to their application in care have been iden -\\ntified. The “implementability” of the guidelines should be \\nimproved, and clinicians should be offered tools and strate -\\ngies to help translate their key recommendations into current \\ncare, in specific environments, and with different types of \\nresources available. This chapter provides a succinct over -\\nview of the production of asthma guidelines over the last \\ndecades, their main recommendations, and how they can help practitioners to improve care delivery, in addition to pro -\\nviding suggestions on how to facilitate their implementation.\\nexaMple of Integrat Ion of guIdelInes \\nrecoMMendat Ions Into care\\nA 35-year-old man with a previous diagnosis of asthma con -\\nsults for persistent respiratory symptoms despite the use of an \\ninhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and “on-demand” inhaled salbu -\\ntamol.

After an adjustment of therapy to a combination of ICS \\nand long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA), which was \\ndetermined to be the minimal treatment required to achieve \\ngood asthma control, he consults the guideline to produce an \\naction plan for the management of asthma exacerbations in \\naddition to scheduling regular follow-up visits to assess ongo -\\ning asthma control and adherence to the recommendations.\\nexaMple of guIdelInes IMpleMentat Ion \\nInItIatIves: case presentat Ion\\nIn order to improve adherence to the Canadian emergency \\ndepartment (ED) asthma management guidelines and improve \\npatient outcomes, a standardized ED asthma care pathway \\n(ACP) was developed for adults.1 Ten Ontario hospital EDs \\n(five interventions, five controls) took part in a 5-month pre-\\npost intervention study. At the intervention sites, the ACP was \\nused in 26.4% of 383 visits (ranging from 6% to 60% among \\nthe sites). When compared with the control sites, the use of \\nmetered-dose inhalers (MDIs), ICSs, referrals, oxygen, and \\ndocumentation of teaching and patient recollection of teach -\\ning were significantly improved (all end points P ≤ .001). An \\nincrease in the peak expiratory flow (PEF) documentation and \\nsystemic corticosteroid use in the ED and on discharge was \\nonly found in patients who were on the ACP at the intervention \\nsites. Admissions to the intervention sites increased from 3.9% \\nto 9.4% in contrast to the control sites, where they remained \\nfairly stable ( P = .016), but did not differ with ACP use. There \\nwere no statistically significant differences in repeat ED visits. \\nThis example shows how small changes in care delivery could \\nresult in a significant improvement in care delivery and it also \\nillustrates the difficulties in changing practice behaviors and \\nintegrating tools to help implement guidelines and standard -\\nize care. As with many initiatives, however, the net result on \\npatient morbidity and health-care use should be assessed, as \\nan analysis of the results of these interventions could help to \\nimprove asthma management to make it more effective, par -\\nticularly in looking at barriers to their implementation and to \\nthe effect of their specific components.\\nAnother similar initiative was aimed at introducing the \\nPediatric Acute Asthma Management Guideline (PAMG) \\nto the ED of a pediatric tertiary care hospital. The medical \\ncharts of 278 retrospective ED visits and 154 prospective vis -\\nits were reviewed.2 During the implementation of the PAMG, \\npatients who visited the ED were more likely to receive oral \\ncorticosteroids ( P < .0001) and oxygen saturation reassess -\\nment before ED discharge ( P < .0001). Improvements in \\nasthma education and discharge planning were noted, but the \\nchanges were not statistically significant. After the imple -\\nmentation of an evidence-based guideline reminder card, \\nmedication treatment for acute asthma in the ED was signifi -\\ncantly improved. However, asthma education and discharge \\nplanning remained unchanged; therefore, efforts to promote \\nguideline-based practice in the ED should emphasize these \\ncomponents.HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\\nClinical practice guidelines have been developed over the \\nlast few decades in many fields of medicine to optimize \\nhealth care according to current evidence and then, hope -\\nfully, decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with \\nvarious conditions. In regard to asthma, the development \\nof these documents was further promoted following an \\nincrease in asthma-related mortality and morbidity asso -\\nciated with industrialized countries during the 1970s. The \\nfirst initiatives came from Australia, New Zealand, Canada, \\nthe United Kingdom, and the United States.3–6 These were \\nfollowed by the development of the international report, \\nGlobal Initiative for Asthma (GINA), inaugurated in 1993, \\nwhich aimed at developing a program to reduce asthma \\nprevalence, morbidity, and mortality worldwide.7 Since \\nthen, the GINA reports have been revised regularly (www.\\nginasthma.com). Updates of national guidelines are also \\nregularly produced.\\nPRODUCTION OF GUIDELINES \\nAND GRADING THE EVIDENCE\\nOver the last two decades, the methods for producing guide -\\nlines have been improved, and quality standards have been \\ndeveloped. For example, the AGREE tool, originally devel -\\noped in 20018 and since revised, offers a standard tool for \\nguideline development, reporting, and evaluation.9 It includes \\n23 items grouped in 6 domains: scope and purpose, stake -\\nholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presenta -\\ntion, applicability, and editorial independence. Furthermore, \\ngrading the evidence has evolved and tools such as the \\nGrades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and \\nEvaluation10 system are now widely used.11 As reported by \\nGuyatt,12 this tool has been developed by a widely representa -\\ntive group of international guideline developers, establishing \\na clear separation between the quality of the evidence and the \\nstrength of the recommendations, and providing an explicit \\nevaluation of the importance of the outcomes of alternative \\nmanagement strategies. Furthermore, it provides explicit, \\ncomprehensive criteria for downgrading and upgrading the \\nquality of the evidence ratings, a transparent process of mov -\\ning from evidence to recommendation, an explicit acknowl -\\nedgment of values and preferences, and a clear, pragmatic \\ninterpretation of strong versus weak recommendations for \\nclinicians, patients, and policy makers (Figure 5.1). This tool \\ncan be useful for systematic reviews and health technology \\nassessments, as well as guidelines.\\nARE GUIDELINES USEFUL?\\nFollowing a review of 59 evaluations that met rigorous sci -\\nentific criteria, Grimshaw and Russell concluded that almost \\nall of the guidelines on various conditions including asthma \\nwere associated with an improvement in medical practice, \\nwhile the size of the improvements in performance varied \\nfrom one intervention to another.13', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 66}),\n"," Document(page_content='49 Guidelines in Asthma\\nNonetheless, there is evidence that guidelines and the ini -\\ntiatives developed to implement their recommendations have \\nsignificantly reduced the severity and mortality of asthma \\nin countries and regions where management plans have \\nbeen implemented.14–18 Otherwise, improved prescription \\npractices have been reported, such as a reduction in rescue \\nmedications and increased prescriptions for ICS.19 However, \\nthe impact of therapeutic guidelines on the clinical outcome \\nof asthma requires better documentation, particularly fol -\\nlowing different implementation strategies, in different set -\\ntings and addressing specific asthma management care gaps \\n(Table\\xa05.1).\\ndo physIcIans Know and coMply wIth guIdelInes?\\nWide variations have been observed in the translation of \\ncurrent guidelines into care, particularly primary care, and \\nvarious care gaps persist.20,21 Although an improvement in \\nguideline implementation has been noted in the last decade, \\nsome recommendations remain problematic. We previously \\nreported significant discrepancies between the Canadian \\nasthma guidelines and the practice of physician, for example, \\nin regard to the use of short-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists, the provision of asthma action plans, or the referral for \\nasthma education.22 Discrepancies were also found between \\nprescriptions for asthma medications in children and the pub -\\nlished asthma consensus guidelines, particularly with regard \\nto anti-inflammatory therapy.23\\nA previous study on the Third Brazilian Consensus on \\nAsthma Management showed that there was poor implemen -\\ntation of these guidelines in the public health-care system.24 \\nMost asthma patients did not receive treatment consistent \\nwith the consensus guidelines, particularly with regard to the \\nunderuse of ICS, possibly due to the lack of access to and \\ninappropriate use of medications, the low adherence to treat -\\nment, the lack of patient knowledge regarding the disease/\\nprinciples of treatment/procedures for using inhaled medica -\\ntions, and the lack of education being mentioned as possible \\ncauses.\\nMore recently, we looked at the recommendations of the \\nmain Canadian asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary \\ndisease (COPD) guidelines for primary care physicians \\nusing a standardized questionnaire, the Physician Practice \\nAssessment Questionnaire (PPAQ).25 The most poorly imple -\\nmented recommendations (in less than 50% of the physi -\\ncians’ patients) were, for both asthma and COPD, referral for Health-care question  (PICO )\\nSystematic r eview\\nStudie s S1\\nOC1\\nImportant outcome sC ritical outcome s\\nGenerate an estimate of the eﬀe ct for e ach outcome\\nFinal rating of quality for e ach outcome: hig h, mod erate, lo w, or ver y low\\nRate overall quality of e vidence\\n(lowest quality among critical outcomes)\\nDecide on the dir ection (for/ag ainst) and g rade streng th (strong/we ak∗)\\nof the re commendation considering:\\nQuality of the e videnc e\\nBalance of desirable/undesirable outcome s\\nValues and preference s\\nDecide if an y revision of direction or streng th is necessary considering:  Resource useRate the quality of e vidence for each out come, acro ss studie s\\nRCTs star t with a high rating , obse rvational studies with a low ratin g\\nRating is mo diﬁed dow nward:\\n– Study limitations\\n– Impr ecision\\n– Inconsistenc y of result s\\n– Indir ectness of e videnc e\\n– Publication bi as likely– Large mag nitude of eﬀ ect\\n– Dose r espons e\\n– Confounders likely minimize the eﬀ ect\\n∗Also lab eled “conditional” or “ discretionar y”Rating is mo diﬁed upward:OC2O C3 OC4S2 S3 S4 S5\\nOutcome s\\nFIGURE 5.1  Schematic view of the GRADE process for developing recommendations.

They may consider that the potential \\nbenefit expected does not justify a change in their practice.\\nThe implementation of recommendations also depends \\non the patient’s acceptance of the suggestions, and there is a \\nneed for adequate communication between the patient and the \\ncaregiver. In this regard, a “shared decision-making” process \\nmay help improve patient adherence to recommendations.29\\nDespite suboptimal implementation, practitioners usually \\nrecognize that guidelines help to standardize medical prac -\\ntice and benefit the patient. However, they need guidance on \\nhow to implement guidelines and they must have sufficient \\ntime and access to sufficient resources (e.g., medication and \\neducators).\\nHOW TO IMPROVE GUIDELINES \\nIMPLEMENTATION\\nThe dissemination of guidelines through medical/scientific \\npublications, mailings, continuing professional development \\n(CPD), workshops, and symposia is generally considered \\ninsufficient to change medical practice.30 Many publications \\nhave addressed the question of how to improve the imple -\\nmentation of guidelines; interactive strategies, practice aids, \\nreminders, algorithms, and summaries, particularly using \\nnew electronic tools, should help facilitate the translation \\nof guideline recommendations into day-to-day care.20,31,32 \\nA multidisciplinary approach is required to achieve this \\ngoal, which involves all health-care providers, with articu -\\nlated interventions and a common message to the patient. \\nThe implementation of guidelines should be tailored to \\nthe environment and the resources available33 (Table 5.2). \\nKnowledge translation models, such as the Knowledge-to-\\nAction framework, can be useful to structure the interven -\\ntions34 (Figure 5.2). Furthermore, tools such as the Guideline \\nImplementability Appraisal (GLIA) can help assess the \\nimplementability of guidelines [www.openclinical.org/\\napplInstrument_glia.html]. In a recent publication, we sum -\\nmarized how to implement guidelines such as the GINA \\nstrategy and this can be applied to any guidelines.35\\ncontent  of current  asthMa guIdelInes\\nAn exhaustive discussion of the guidelines-based manage -\\nment of asthma is beyond the scope of this chapter and other \\nsections of this book will discuss those various components. \\nAlthough the reader should consult the respective guidelines, \\nherein we will stress some general principles and common -\\nalities of the current guidelines.36–39\\nDefinition of Asthma and Diagnosis\\nThe definition of asthma provided by the current guidelines \\nhas not changed significantly in the last two decades and \\nindicates that it is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the \\nairways characterized by variable airway obstruction and \\nairway hyperresponsiveness, which manifest in the form of \\nvarious respiratory symptoms—dyspnea, wheezing, cough, chest tightness, and phlegm production. Specific criteria \\nhave been reported to establish what constitutes signifi -\\ncant variability/reversibility of airway obstruction and what \\nis considered significantly increased airway responsive -\\nness.36–39 An assessment of the diagnosis in young children \\nis considered more complex as respiratory symptoms are \\nfrequent in nonasthmatic children and pulmonary func -\\ntion tests are not usually reliable before 6 years of age. \\nTherefore, a diagnosis of asthma in a child is mostly based \\non a history of recurrent asthmalike symptoms, a family \\nhistory of asthma or atopy, maternal smoking, and other \\nrisk factors for asthma; specific criteria are currently sug -\\ngested by asthma guidelines.36,40\\nGoal of Therapy: A Shift from Severity \\nto Control of Asthma\\nAs there is no cure for asthma, we should try to reduce the \\nconsequences of asthma as much as possible. Furthermore, \\nas stressed by Cockcroft, asthma control should be differen -\\ntiated from its severity, where “control” reflects the degree \\nto which asthma manifestations are kept to a minimum with \\ntreatment, while severity mostly refers to the intrinsic mech -\\nanisms of the disease, evidenced by the level of treatment \\nrequired to achieve control.41 The former is also more closely \\nassociated with the risk of asthma events.42 So, as Canadian \\nasthma guidelines have suggested since the 1990s, in the \\nlast decade, most guidelines have adopted a “control-driven” \\napproach for the management of asthma, and recommend that \\nmanagement should be based on achieving and maintaining \\ncomplete asthma control37–40 (Table 5.3).

The treatment of comorbidi -\\nties and monitoring control (including, for some, occasional \\nPEF measures) should also be addressed with an emphasis on \\nregular outpatient follow-up.\\nEnvironmental Control and Lifestyle\\nGuidelines suggest avoiding contact with triggering factors \\nwhenever possible (except exercise, which is to be promoted). \\nThe identification of sensitizers that should be avoided at \\nhome, at school, and in the workplace should be performed. \\nRespiratory “irritants” (e.g., indoor or outdoor pollutants), \\naspirin and other anti-inflammatory agents for asthmatic \\nindividuals intolerant to those drugs, should also be avoided. \\nMany guidelines suggest measures to reduce the effects of \\nenvironmental triggers, although the level of evidence to \\nestablish their beneficial effects on asthma is often low or \\nuncertain.\\nSpecific asthma phenotypes have been reported in smok -\\ning and in obese asthmatic patients, and these last two groups \\nseem to be more resistant to therapy.44,45 Smoking cessation \\nis a key measure in asthmatic subjects who smoke and weight \\nloss should be part of the recommendations for obese persons.\\nPharmacological Treatment\\nTreatment “steps” are often recommended, although some \\nguidelines, including the Canadian guidelines, consider \\ntreatment as a continuum.36–39,41 A reduction of airway \\ninflammation and an improvement in symptom control with \\nadded bronchodilators when ICS are insufficient are the basis \\nof asthma therapy. Medications categorized as relievers  (or \\nrescue /quick-relief medications ) include short-acting bron -\\nchodilators, long-acting bronchodilators with a rapid onset of \\naction such as formoterol, and rarely, in patients intolerant to \\nbeta2-agonists, ipratropium bromide. Otherwise, preventers  \\n(controllers  or long-term preventative medications ) include \\nICS and oral corticosteroids, LABA, leukotriene-receptors \\nantagonists (LTRAs), and more rarely, mainly in some severe \\nasthmatic patients, sustained-release theophylline and anti -\\ncholinergics, and in severe allergic asthma, monoclonal anti -\\nbodies such as omalizumab.\\nRapid-acting beta2-agonists are considered the drugs of \\nchoice in children and adults for the relief of acute symp -\\ntoms. Long-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, including for -\\nmoterol and salmeterol, should not be used as monotherapy \\nin asthma as these medications do not appear to influence \\nairway inflammation in asthma. Occasionally, rapid-acting \\nbeta2-agonists can also be used to prevent exercise-induced \\nasthma although their need for this purpose should be mini -\\nmal if the asthma is sufficiently controlled. They should be \\nkept to a minimum frequency, usually less than three to four \\ntimes per week according to the different guidelines, as the need for a bronchodilator is considered to reflect the degree \\nof asthma control.\\nICS are considered the mainstay of anti-inflammatory \\nmedication for asthma. They generally improve lung func -\\ntion and airway responsiveness, reduce and prevent asthma \\nsymptoms, and prevent exacerbations.46\\nLABAs are generally considered as add-on therapy when \\nICS are insufficient to control asthma, and are a preferred \\nalternative to doubling the dose of ICS in adults.47 These \\nagents do not significantly reduce airway inflammation and \\nshould always  be used with an anti-inflammatory medica -\\ntion such as ICS.48\\nLTRAs are considered as a second choice for initial anti-\\ninflammatory therapy of asthma, and as a second-choice \\nadd-on therapy to ICS.36–41,49 Sustained-relief theophylline is \\nconsidered as a third-line add-on controller medication.\\nMonitoring of Asthma\\nOften, asthma control is poorly assessed, which can lead to \\nundertreatment and an increased risk of severe events. This \\nis often due to the poor use of control criteria and objec -\\ntive measures that assess airflow obstruction.50 Spirometry \\nshould be regularly measured, ideally at each visit and at \\nleast once a year. If spirometry is not available, PEF mea -\\nsurements with devices such as the Mini-Wright peak flow \\nmeter should be utilized. Measures of airway inflammation \\n(i.e., induced sputum and exhaled nitric oxide) have been pro -\\nposed, particularly for moderate to severe asthma, to titrate \\nthe treatment, and these measures have resulted in the reduc -\\ntion of exacerbations.\\nManagement of Exacerbations: The Asthma Action Plan\\nSince the late 1980s, consensus reports recognize that \\nasthma is a chronic disease whose seriousness can fluctu -\\nate on a daily basis and that asthmatics should know how \\nto modify their treatment accordingly. Written action plans \\nare recommended for all asthmatic patients, indicating when \\nand how to intensify their anti-inflammatory therapy accord -\\ning to asthma control criteria, when to introduce oral corti -\\ncosteroids, and when to seek medical advice. Action plans \\nbased on symptoms are as effective as those that are based on \\nPEF monitoring.51 Although much remains to be evaluated in \\nregard to the optimal action plan, the most important strate -\\ngies to include in action plans have recently been formally \\nevaluated.36\\nTreatment of Associated Conditions\\nRhinosinusitis, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux, or other \\nassociated respiratory conditions such as smoking-induced \\nCOPD should be identified and the required treatment mea -\\nsures addressed.52\\nUPDATING CURRENT GUIDELINES\\nMost national and international guidelines are regularly \\nupdated, although the process usually takes from a few \\nmonths up to 1 or 2 years. Sometimes, the whole document ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 71}),\n"," Document(page_content='54 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nis revised with regard to potential new topics or the need to \\nupdate recommendations according to the reviewers of the \\ncurrent evidence. As an example, in the most recent Canadian \\nguidelines, four clinical questions were identified (PICO \\nquestions) as a focus to update the guidelines, including (1) \\nthe role of noninvasive measurements of airway inflamma -\\ntion, such as induced-sputum analysis, for the adjustment of \\ntherapy; (2) how to initiate add-on therapy to ICS for uncon -\\ntrolled asthma; (3) the role of a combination ICS and a LABA \\ncombination as a reliever and as a reliever and a controller; \\nand, finally, (4) how to increase controller medication when \\nasthma control is acutely lost as part of a self-management \\naction plan for exacerbations. The strength of the recommen -\\ndations is based on the GRADE tool.\\nWith respect to the GINA strategy, this guideline is \\nreviewed every 6–12 months and changes are highlighted in \\nits introduction. Recent grading has been performed accord -\\ning to the GRADE tool. The British Thoracic Society’s \\n(BTS) asthma guidelines have been revised almost every \\nyear over the last 5 years, in collaboration with the Scottish \\nIntercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). It uses a grading \\nsystem from 1+ to 4+ based on the level of evidence and from \\nA to D based on the grades of recommendation.\\nsuMMarIes of guIdelInes\\nFor Health-Care Professionals\\nGuidelines developers have now produced summaries of \\ntheir guidelines and of key recommendations (e.g., “Slim \\nJims” of Canadian Guidelines, GINA’s “Pocket Guide for \\nAsthma Management and Prevention,” and others). These \\ndocuments can help find the main features of a guideline \\nwhile referencing the core document if needed (www.respi -\\nratoryguidelines.ca).\\nFor Patients\\nPatients’ guideline summaries are becoming increasingly \\navailable as offered by the recent BTS-SIGN guideline.53,54\\nFUTURE OF ASTHMA GUIDELINES\\nFurther research is still required to optimize the implemen -\\ntation of guidelines, but more resources should be made \\navailable to accomplish this task, as they are currently \\nmainly allocated to their production and dissemination. \\nInterventions to help translate guidelines into care should be \\noffered and improved. New communications tools such as \\nintelligent telephones, handheld computers, and user-friendly \\nwebsites offer innovative ways of communicating guideline \\nrecommendations.20 Web-based social networks, communi -\\nties of practice, and other means of interacting are increas -\\ningly available. Electronic health records can also possibly \\nhelp improve access to recommendations at the site of care.55 \\nForums such as the Guidelines International Network (G-I-\\nN)56 can help exchange ideas on the best methods to effec -\\ntively translate guidelines.CONCLUSIONS\\nEvidence-based guidelines can help optimize medical prac -\\ntice, but more effort should be made to better implement \\nthem. Methods to produce, assess, and translate guidelines \\nmore effectively have been developed. Asthma guidelines \\nhave been among the first guidelines produced and current \\nrecommendations have become more consistent from one \\nguideline to another. Asthma management now universally \\nresides on confirming the diagnosis by objective means, \\nachieving and maintaining asthma control according to a set \\nof criteria, and using nonpharmacological and pharmaco -\\nlogical interventions to achieve this goal. Particular attention \\nshould be given to persistent care gaps, such as asthma educa -\\ntion, inhaler technique demonstration, and the provision/use \\nof asthma action plans for the management of exacerbations.\\nREFERENCES\\n 1.

She was breast-\\nfed until 8 months when a soy-based formula was introduced. \\nAt 1 year, and after cow’s milk was introduced, AW broke \\nout in hives and vomited immediately after ingesting milk. \\nAW was diagnosed with eczema shortly after birth. It was \\ninitially confined to her face but it has progressively spread \\nto include her entire body. She has never had a wheezing \\nillness, but her father has asthma. You perform percutane -\\nous skin testing for the foods that account for the majority of \\nfood allergies in early childhood. AW has positive skin tests \\nto peanut, soy, milk, and egg. She is placed on an elemental \\nformula.\\nAW returns to your clinic 6 months later. She has done \\nwell on an elemental diet and her eczema is well controlled. \\nAW is here today because she has had several episodes of \\ncough and wheeze over the past 3 months, with the most \\nrecent episode requiring an emergency room visit and a \\ncourse of oral steroids. Currently, she is being treated with \\nnebulized albuterol, which she requires up to several times a \\nday to treat episodes of cough and wheeze. There is no envi -\\nronmental tobacco smoke exposure and no pets in her home, \\nalthough she is exposed to a dog three times a week while \\nbeing cared for at her grandparents’ home.

This chapter will focus on how to diagnose \\nasthma in this challenging group of children with recurrent \\ncough and wheeze.\\nDiagnosing asthma in a preschool-age child can be a chal -\\nlenging endeavor. First and foremost, many preschool-age \\nchildren with recurrent episodes of wheezing will “outgrow” \\ntheir asthma. Large birth cohorts have shown that approxi -\\nmately 50% of preschool-age children with recurrent wheez -\\ning have a transient condition that resolves by grade school \\n(6 years of age).4 In addition, the difficulties inherent in diag -\\nnosing asthma in older children and adults are magnified in \\nthe preschool-age child. Diagnostic studies such as spirom -\\netry, bronchial challenge testing, and exhaled nitric oxide \\n(FeNO) that are used to support the diagnosis of asthma are \\noften not feasible in the preschool-age child. Thus, when con -\\nsidering an asthma diagnosis in younger children, one must \\nrely on many aspects of their current and past medical his -\\ntory, their family and environmental history, and the findings \\nof physical examinations.\\nIMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE \\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\\nRecurrent or persistent respiratory symptoms often prompt \\nconsideration of a diagnosis of asthma. The most frequent \\npresenting symptom is recurrent wheeze.4 Because many \\nparents confuse wheeze with upper airway congestion or \\nnoise, previous physician-documented wheezing is helpful \\nin confirming the presence of true wheeze. Often, wheez -\\ning has only been associated with previous viral respiratory \\ntract infections, but it is important to clarify if any wheez -\\ning has been appreciated independent of obvious respiratory \\ninfections. Additional triggers of wheeze and other respira -\\ntory symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath include \\nexercise or activity, exposure to furred or feathered animals, \\nand environmental tobacco smoke.\\nCough is another important symptom that is often \\nreported by caregivers, and persistent cough can be a sign \\nof an active disease. Unfortunately, cough is a nonspecific \\nsymptom, as most children cough during childhood, espe -\\ncially those with viral respiratory tract illnesses. The char -\\nacteristic asthma cough is described as dry and it will often \\nrespond to bronchodilator therapy. Additionally, persistent \\ncough apart from a viral illness, especially nocturnal cough, \\nis consistent with a diagnosis of asthma and a frequent noc -\\nturnal cough may be associated with a more severe disease.5 \\nFinally, cough associated with physical activity such as \\nexercise, laughing, or tickling is often related to asthma.6 \\nFurthermore, a history of tachypnea, respiratory distress, \\nor hypoxia is very helpful in assessing the severity of an \\nepisode and may help to distinguish a simple upper respi -\\nratory infection (URI) from an episode of bronchospasm \\nassociated with asthma.IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF PAST \\nMEDICAL HISTORY\\nIt is important to clarify birth history, specifically prematu -\\nrity and a history of oxygen requirement and/or mechanical \\nventilation, in patients undergoing an evaluation for recur -\\nrent respiratory symptoms. Patients born prematurely often \\ndevelop chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia \\n(BPD) and many also have airway hyperresponsiveness, a \\ncharacteristic feature of asthma.7 Some studies have shown a \\nlack of persistent inflammation in former premature infants \\nwith current asthma, and the condition may be different in \\nthis population compared with former term infants with \\ncurrent asthma.8 That being said, former premature infant \\nstatus is associated with an increased risk of asthma, espe -\\ncially when presented with additional risk factors such as a \\nvery low birth weight, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and \\nprolonged oxygen requirement.9 Premature status does not \\nappear to be associated with an increased risk of allergies, \\nand there is some controversy as to whether late prematurity \\n(34–36 weeks estimated gestational age) is associated with \\nasthma in later years.10–12\\nIt is important to clarify the details regarding the child’s \\nrespiratory status during viral URIs and when the child \\nis well. Children who have a history of cough or wheeze \\nbetween episodes of URIs are more likely to have persistent \\nwheezing in the future compared with children with symp -\\ntoms associated only with viral URIs. Additionally, chil -\\ndren with frequent episodes of recurrent wheeze or cough \\n(more than three per year) are more likely to have persistent \\ndisease.4\\nThe number of unscheduled visits to the primary physi -\\ncian, emergency or urgent care center visits, and hospitaliza -\\ntions secondary to wheezing episodes can help determine the \\nseverity of the symptoms. Finally, a good response to pre -\\nvious therapies, including bronchodilators and inhaled and \\nsystemic corticosteroids, is helpful in assessing the etiology \\nof respiratory symptoms because simple URIs without asso -\\nciated bronchospasm will not be improved with the use of \\nbronchodilator therapy or systemic corticosteroids.\\nPRESENCE OF ATOPIC DERMATITIS\\nInfants and young children who have both atopic dermatitis \\n(AD) and a recurrent respiratory wheeze are at an increased \\nrisk for developing asthma. In the Tucson birth cohort, the \\npresence of eczema was found to be a major risk factor in \\npredicting the likelihood of persistent disease.13 Based on \\nthis cohort, the Asthma Predictive Index (API) was devel -\\noped as listed in Table 6.1. This tool uses a combination of \\nclinical and easily available laboratory data to help iden -\\ntify preschool-age children at risk for developing persistent \\nasthma. The index requires recurrent wheezing in the first \\n3 years, plus one major (parental history of asthma or phy -\\nsician-diagnosed AD) or two of three minor (eosinophilia \\n[≥4%], wheezing unrelated to a viral URI, and/or allergic \\nrhinitis) risk factors. Children with a positive API were up to ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 76}),\n"," Document(page_content='59 Diagnosis of Asthma in Preschool-Age Children\\n10 times more likely to have active asthma at some time dur -\\ning grade school compared with those with a negative API. In \\naddition, both the negative predictive value and the specific -\\nity for the API were greater than 80%, indicating that the vast \\nmajority of preschool-age children with recurrent wheeze \\nand a negative API will not have asthma at school age.13\\nThe API has recently been modified based on a large early \\nintervention study called Prevention of Early Asthma in Kids \\n(PEAK).14 In this study, 2- to 3-year-old children with recur -\\nrent wheeze who were also at risk of developing persistent \\nasthma were enrolled to receive 2 years of an inhaled gluco -\\ncorticoid or a matching placebo. The entry criteria included \\nthe presence of one of three major criteria (parental history \\nof asthma, physician-diagnosed AD, or allergic sensitization \\nto\\xa0≥1 aeroallergen) or two minor criteria (allergic sensitization \\nto milk, egg, or peanut; wheezing unrelated to URIs; or blood \\neosinophils ≥4%). As both AD and asthma are often manifes -\\ntations of atopy, many children initially present with eczema \\nwith or without food allergies, then develop asthma, and finally \\nallergic rhinitis. This sequence of developing one atopic condi -\\ntion after another has been called the “atopic march.”15\\nEARLY SENSITIZATION TO AEROALLERGENS\\nAn important publication by the German Multicentre Allergy \\nStudy (MAS) provides further insight into the pivotal role of \\natopy in the development of persistent asthma.16 In this large \\nbirth cohort study of over 1300 children, the authors sought \\nto determine the onset of allergen sensitization, and the role \\nthat allergen exposure plays in the development of asthma \\nin childhood. To accomplish this, sensitization to food and \\naeroallergens was measured serially from 1 to 10 years, \\nwhile exposure to dust mites and cat allergens was serially \\nmeasured from 6 months to 5 years. Spirometry was also \\nmeasured at 7, 10, and 13 years, while bronchial hyperre -\\nsponsiveness to histamine was determined at 7 years.\\nWheezing children who had developed allergic sensitiza -\\ntion by 3 years were defined as having an “atopic wheeze,” \\nwhile those who did not develop allergic sensitization were considered to have a “nonatopic wheeze.” There was no dif -\\nference in either the frequency or the severity of the wheeze \\nepisodes between those with an atopic wheeze compared \\nwith those with a nonatopic wheeze during the first 5 years \\nof life. However, from 6 to 13 years, the percentage of chil -\\ndren with persistent wheeze progressively declined in those \\nwith nonatopic wheeze, so that by 13 years of age, 90% had \\nno evidence of active asthma and their lung function was nor -\\nmal. In contrast, 44% of the children with atopic wheeze had \\nactive asthma at age 13 and they developed impaired lung \\nfunction. The children with asthma who were at greatest \\nrisk of lung function impairment were both sensitized and \\nexposed to high concentrations of indoor aeroallergens.16\\nRESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTIONS EARLY IN LIFE\\nStudies have shown that severe bronchiolitis early in life \\nnecessitating hospitalization and/or oxygen requirement is \\nan independent risk factor for the development of asthma.17,18 \\nThe most commonly recovered organisms from these severe \\ninfections are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovi -\\nrus (RV). It remains to be determined whether the infection \\nitself results in the development of asthma, or whether the \\ninfection is the inciting event in children destined to have \\nasthma. Historically, RSV infection has held a strong asso -\\nciation with predicting future asthma; however, more recent \\nstudies have emphasized the role of RV infection in predict -\\ning future asthma, and in some some studies, it has actually \\nheld a stronger association with the presence of persistent \\nasthma than RSV.19,20 This highlights the need for contin -\\nued vigilant monitoring of children with severe disease even \\nwhen they are RSV-negative.\\nIMPORTANT ASPECTS OF FAMILY HISTORY\\nThe evaluation of children with recurrent respiratory \\nsymptoms should include thorough reviews of their family \\nmedical history. As discussed earlier, physician-diagnosed \\nparental asthma is one of the two major risk factors in the \\nAPI for persistent wheezing in a preschool-age child.13,14 \\nReviewing the family history for the presence of other atopic \\ndiseases, such as allergic rhinitis, food allergy, and eczema, \\nwill help establish a potential atopic genetic background for \\nthe patient.\\nIMPORTANT ASPECTS OF \\nENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY\\nAn environmental history should be obtained in order to deter -\\nmine the presence of potential perennial allergens in the home \\nsuch as dust mites and pets.21 As noted earlier, the MAS study \\nidentified early sensitization and exposure to an indoor aeroal -\\nlergen such as dog or cat dander, dust mites, mold, or cockroach \\nallergens as among the strongest predictors of subsequent persis -\\ntent asthma in preschool-age children with recurrent wheeze.16 \\nThus, information such as the types of family pets, both furred \\nand feathered, whether the pets are indoor or outdoor, and if TABLE 6.1\\nAPI versus the Modified API\\nAsthma Predictive Index13Modified Asthma Predictive \\nIndex14\\nMajor Criteria\\n• Parental history of asthma\\n• Physician-diagnosed atopic \\ndermatitis• Parental history of asthma\\n• Physician-diagnosed atopic \\ndermatitis\\n• Allergic sensitization to ≥1 \\naeroallergen\\nMinor Criteria\\n• Physician-diagnosed allergic \\nrhinitis\\n• Wheezing apart from colds\\n• Blood eosinophilia ( >4%)• Allergic sensitization to egg, milk, \\nor peanut\\n• Wheezing apart from colds\\n• Blood eosinophilia ( >4%)', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 77}),\n"," Document(page_content='60 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nthey sleep in the child’s bedroom should be ascertained. In dust \\nmite-endemic regions, the use of mattress and pillow covers, the \\nfrequency and manner of cleaning bedding, and the presence of \\ncarpeting, curtains, upholstered furniture, and stuffed animals \\nshould be included in an environmental history.22 Additional \\nquestions should address the age of the home and dampness, \\nrelating to the presence of mold. Sensitization to mold species \\nsuch as Aspergillus  and Penicillium  has been shown to be asso -\\nciated with an asthma diagnosis.23 Dampness in general unre -\\nlated to mold sensitization has been found to be associated with \\nincreased upper and lower respiratory symptoms in children. \\nA recent meta-analysis assessing the health effects of indoor \\ndampness or mold exposure in 31,742 children from 8 ongoing \\nEuropean birth cohorts revealed that a home environment with \\nmold in early life is associated with an increased risk of asthma \\nin young children and allergic rhinitis symptoms in school-age \\nchildren.24\\nPrevious studies have shown that children who are sensi -\\ntized to house-dust mite allergens and to the mold Alternaria  \\nare more likely to have asthma as documented by bronchial \\nhyperresponsiveness.25 Details on the presence of other \\npotential irritants such as tobacco smoke, fireplaces, or wood-\\nburning stoves; on the type of heating and air-cooling systems; \\nand on the proximity to road traffic should be noted as studies \\nhave related the exposure to traffic-related air pollution and \\nbiomass smoke with persistent asthma.26,27\\nIMPORTANT ASPECTS OF \\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nThere are several portions of the physical examination that may \\nsupport atopic disease in young children with recurrent wheeze. \\nAn examination of the nose will often reveal edema and rhinor -\\nrhea, but unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to differentiate \\nallergic rhinitis from viral upper respiratory illnesses. When \\nperforming a lung examination on a child who appears well, \\nthe examination, including the respiratory rate, inspiratory to \\nexpiratory phase ratio, oxygen saturation, and auscultation, will \\nlikely be normal. As such, a normal lung examination during a \\ntime when a child is well does not rule in or rule out the diagno -\\nsis of asthma. During an acute episode, a lung examination will \\nbe most helpful. The documentation of wheezing, tachypnea, \\nretractions, and/or hypoxia is important in characterizing the \\nsymptoms and the severity of an episode. A skin examination \\nis important in determining whether the child has any con -\\ncomitant AD, specifically looking for erythema, excoriations, \\nthickening, or lichenification. In the preschool age group, the \\ndistribution of eczema may include the face and the extensor \\nregions as seen in infancy or it may be transitioning to the flexor \\nregions as seen in the older age groups.\\nTESTING OPTIONS IN YOUNGER CHILDREN\\nlung funct Ion testIng\\nIn older children, lung function tests such as spirometry and \\nlung volume measurements (body plethysmography) are often helpful in confirming or excluding a diagnosis of asthma. An \\nimprovement in airflow limitation by ≥12% following alb -\\nuterol inhalation in a patient with respiratory symptoms is \\nstrongly suggestive of asthma.28 Unfortunately, these tests \\nrequire both cooperation and coordination to complete. In \\npreschool-age children, lung function testing is possible, but \\nits regular application is limited by the requirement for seda -\\ntion, costly equipment, and specialized personnel.\\nIn younger children, several techniques are available \\nto quantitate the lower airway function. Currently, most \\nof the techniques are used in research settings and norma -\\ntive values are available in the American Thoracic Society/\\nEuropean Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines; how -\\never, the standardization of the techniques is lacking and \\nthe results may be difficult to interpret.29 The available \\ntechniques include standard spirometry, maximal flow ref -\\nerenced to functional residual capacity, impulse oscillometry \\n(IOS), interrupter resistance (Rint), plethysmography, gas \\ndilution techniques, and gas mixing indices.29 These tests \\nmay be used in clinical situations such as: (1) unexplained \\ntachypnea, cough, hypoxemia, or respiratory distress where \\na definitive diagnosis is not clear; (2) children with lower air -\\nway symptoms who are not responding to standard therapy; \\n(3) determining the severity of lower airway obstruction \\nand providing a basis for follow-up after intervention; and \\n(4) better defining the course of diseases and the response to \\ntherapy in research studies. It is hoped that further advances \\nwill allow for a wider application of this technology as the \\nequipment becomes more affordable and easier to use, and \\nbetter normative standards become available.\\nIMpulse oscIlloMetry\\nIOS is a technology that utilizes small-amplitude pressure \\noscillations to determine the resistance of the airway. It is \\nlargely effort independent and does not require coordina -\\ntion, but it does require the cooperation of the child, which \\nis a limiting factor for routine use.30 To perform IOS, the \\nchild holds a mouthpiece in place over a 30 second period \\nof time while breathing normally (tidal breathing). Sound \\nimpulses of various frequencies from 5 to 35 Hz are applied \\nto the airway through the mouthpiece with the total respira -\\ntory system resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) determined \\nat the various frequencies. IOS has been studied in young \\nchildren with suspected asthma and conflicting results have \\nbeen obtained. Some investigators have not found IOS to be \\nuseful in differentiating recurrent wheezers from healthy \\npreschool-age children, while others have found significant \\ndifferences in both the baseline Rrs and the change in Rrs \\nfollowing the inhalation of a beta-agonist in asthmatic com -\\npared with nonasthmatic children.31,32 Lastly, young children \\nat risk for asthma have been shown to display a significant \\nchange in Rrs following bronchodilator therapy compared \\nwith age-matched control children.33,34 Thus, IOS has the \\npotential to be a useful lung function measure in young chil -\\ndren with suspected asthma, but currently it remains largely \\na research tool.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 78}),\n"," Document(page_content='61 Diagnosis of Asthma in Preschool-Age Children\\nIn older children and adults who are able to complete \\nspirometry, a bronchial challenge (methacholine, histamine, \\nor exercise) demonstrating airway hyperresponsiveness is \\nstrongly supportive of a diagnosis of asthma.35 Because \\nyounger children are unable to perform spirometry, bron -\\nchial challenge testing has been modified by incorporating \\nauscultation and pulse oximetry monitoring. Currently, the \\npresence of wheeze, significant tachypnea, and/or a 5% or \\nmore decrease in oxygen saturation from baseline constitutes \\na positive challenge.36 Unfortunately, the test is not standard -\\nized and there has been dispute as to what is the best parame -\\nter to confirm positivity. These issues aside, there is evidence \\nthat more severe degrees of airway hyperresponsiveness are \\ncorrelated with an increased likelihood of disease develop -\\nment and persistence.37\\nother tests\\nRadiographic studies such as chest x-rays and chest computed \\ntomography (CT) scans of young children with a history of \\nrecurrent wheezing or cough are not routinely obtained dur -\\ning periods when the child is well. The usefulness of radio -\\ngraphic studies during acute wheezing episodes has been \\ndebated and are usually reserved for patients with significant \\ntachypnea, localized findings on auscultation, associated \\nfever, or significant hypoxemia.38 Additionally, chest radio -\\ngraphs can be useful when concern exists about a foreign \\nbody (FB) or the presence of an anatomical abnormality.\\nThe demonstration of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) \\neither by percutaneous skin prick testing or by a serum-specific \\nIgE measurement can confirm atopy in a child. Because it \\noften takes several seasons to develop sensitization to seasonal \\naeroallergens such as trees, grass, or weed pollen, skin test -\\ning in the preschool-age child is often limited to perennial \\nallergens (dust mite and cockroach allergens, mold, and pet \\ndander) or food allergens if this is a concern for an individual \\npatient. Documented early sensitization to an allergen(s) is a \\nrisk factor for persistent disease with over 60% of 2- to 3-year-\\nold children with recurrent wheezing having a positive modi -\\nfied API with sensitization to either food or aeroallergens.14 \\nUnfortunately, negative testing in a young child does not rule \\nout atopy. It merely confirms that there is currently no sensiti -\\nzation to the allergens tested. In fact, a negative test at a young \\nage does not predict whether or not the child might develop \\nallergic sensitization in the future.39,40\\nAdditional laboratory results such as an elevated circu -\\nlating eosinophil count or an elevated serum IgE level may \\nsuggest atopy, but are much less specific. With that said, an \\nelevated eosinophil count is considered a minor criterion for \\npredicting the persistence of wheeze as defined by the API \\nand the modified API.13,14\\nIn patients in whom there is concern for recurrent infec -\\ntion as the etiology of recurrent wheeze or cough, a screen -\\ning immune system evaluation may be warranted, including \\nquantitative immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgM, and IgA) \\nand assays for functional antibodies. Typically, patients with \\nan underlying immunodeficiency have additional signs and symptoms apart from recurrent wheeze or cough, such as a \\nrecurrent fever, failure to thrive, and documented bacterial \\ninfections.41\\nCystic fibrosis (CF) must also be considered in any young \\nchild presenting with a history of recurrent or persistent respi -\\nratory symptoms. Classically, CF presents with additional \\nsymptoms of failure to thrive or evidence of pancreatic insuf -\\nficiency, but milder variants of CF exist and these can be ruled \\nout by a normal sweat test or by the demonstration of the \\nabsence of a CF DNA mutation. The presence of bilateral nasal \\npolyps is highly suspicious for CF. The reference ranges for \\ninfants under 6 months of age are: ≤29 mmol/L, CF unlikely; \\n30–59 mmol/L, intermediate; and ≥60 mmol/L, indicative of \\nCF. The recommended reference values for a change in sweat \\nchloride after 6 months of age are: ≤39 mmol/L, CF unlikely; \\n40–59 mmol/L, intermediate; and ≥60 mmol/L, indicative \\nof\\xa0CF.42\\nSome patients present with recurrent episodes of chok -\\ning or aspiration or a history of gastroesophageal reflux \\nsymptoms in addition to recurrent wheeze or cough. These \\npatients warrant an evaluation for a swallowing dysfunction, \\nand aspiration or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) by \\nbarium swallow and/or a pH probe study. These problems are \\nnot infrequently found in combination with underlying bron -\\nchial hyperresponsiveness and the treatment of GERD, often \\nresulting in an improvement of both problems.43\\nFinally, in patients with a history of inspiratory stridor or \\nwheeze, or in patients who have failed to respond to bron -\\nchodilator therapy or a short course of systemic steroids, tra -\\ncheomalacia must be considered. Although a diagnosis can \\noften be made clinically, the diagnosis and severity assess -\\nment are best made by bronchoscopy.44\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF RECURRENT \\nWHEEZE IN PRESCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN\\nWhen evaluating a preschool-age child with suspected \\nasthma, one must rule out other respiratory diseases that \\npresent with cough and wheeze. The differential diagnosis \\nof recurrent cough and wheeze is quite extensive, but it can \\nbe narrowed down based on a thorough history and physi -\\ncal examination (Table 6.2). Additionally, one should focus \\nfirst on common conditions such as GERD, and upper airway \\ndiseases such as rhinitis and sinusitis, unless the evaluation \\nsupports pursuing rare etiologies.\\nGERD is commonly diagnosed in young children. Often, \\nthis age group does not complain of the classic symptoms of \\nheartburn or abdominal pain, but rather presents with excess \\nburping or emesis, coughing after meals, or nocturnal cough \\nor wheeze.45 A diagnosis can be clinically suspected and con -\\nfirmed with a positive response to an empiric therapy with \\nan acid suppression regimen. Alternatively, a pH/impedance \\nprobe to document increased or prolonged events of acid \\nand nonacid stomach contents in the esophagus, or radio -\\ngraphic studies such as a tailored barium swallow/upper gas -\\ntrointestinal (GI) series may be utilized before treatment is \\nstarted. Because GERD and asthma symptoms may coexist, ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 79}),\n"," Document(page_content='62 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\na diagnosis of one or the other is not mutually exclusive. \\nThere are conflicting studies regarding whether the treat -\\nment of GERD results in improved asthma symptoms and a \\ndecreased need for asthma medication.46–47\\nChronic sinusitis or rhinitis with associated postnasal \\ndrip may contribute to persistent cough in the preschool-\\nage patient. Typically, patients have evidence of persistent \\nnasal congestion or drainage in association with the cough. \\nThe cough is more likely to be wet and/or productive and \\nis worse at night or early morning. This type of cough will \\nnot improve with bronchodilator or inhaled corticosteroid \\ntherapy, but often improves with the treatment of the under -\\nlying condition. The treatment can be started empirically, \\nbut a sinus CT may also be useful if considering a prolonged \\nantibiotic course.48\\nTracheomalacia is a common anatomical defect seen in \\nyoung children. Patients with tracheomalacia often present \\nwith recurrent episodes of stridor, wheeze, or barky cough, \\nwhich are worsened by crying, and a concurrent respira -\\ntory infection.49,50 The respiratory symptoms often subside \\nwhile sleeping, in contrast to asthma symptoms that often \\nworsen at night. In many patients, the symptoms are present \\nbetween episodes of infection, but mild cases may only be \\nsymptomatic with infection or vigorous crying. Additionally, \\ntreatment with a bronchodilator results in no change or even \\nworsens the symptoms because it results in diminished air -\\nway tone in the presence of malacia. Glucocorticoids, both \\nsystemic and inhaled, are also ineffective. For the majority \\nof patients, the symptoms associated with tracheomalacia resolve by age 2, but more persistent disease can occur. An \\nevaluation for less common etiologies, including a tracheo -\\nesophageal fistula (TEF), a vascular ring, or an underlying \\nconnective tissue disorder, should be pursued for severe or \\npersistent presentations. A bronchoscopy is the examination \\nof choice in the diagnosis and assessment of tracheomalacia.\\nMechanical airway compression due to congenital cardiac \\nanomalies should be considered in a patient with recurrent \\nrespiratory symptoms that have failed to improve with bron -\\nchodilator or corticosteroid therapy. Anatomic compression \\nis obviously a less common etiology for recurrent wheeze \\ncompared with asthma, but it is often unrecognized in this \\nage group. Compression can occur due to vascular rings or \\nslings (right-sided or double aortic arch, anomalous innomi -\\nnate artery, or pulmonary artery sling) or due to an enlarge -\\nment of the cardiac and/or pulmonary vasculature (dilated \\npulmonary arteries, left atrial enlargement, or massive car -\\ndiomegaly). A classic presentation includes recurrent respi -\\nratory difficulties with wheezing and stridor. Many patients \\nhave associated dysphagia or apnea. The symptoms are usu -\\nally aggravated by crying and concurrent respiratory viral \\ninfections. The severity of the symptoms is dependent on the \\nlocation and the degree of the anomaly. When this diagno -\\nsis is suspected, a chest x-ray should be obtained with close \\nattention to the side of the aortic arch, the size and shape of \\nthe cardiac silhouette, and for the presence of tracheal devia -\\ntion or constriction. Esophagrams are often used to evaluate \\nfor vascular rings and slings, but are nonspecific and may be \\nnormal despite the presence of an anomaly if that anomaly \\ndoes not compress the esophagus. Of note, bronchoscopy is \\nnot diagnostic; rather magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \\nof the chest or multidetector CT (MDCT) is employed to \\nconfirm the diagnosis.51 Finally, congestive heart failure in \\nyoung children rarely presents with wheezing, but it may \\npresent with a history of increased work of breathing.\\nThe rare H-type TEF may need to be considered in a \\npatient with recurrent respiratory symptoms, especially \\nrecurrent pneumonia or persistent infiltrates on a chest radio -\\ngraph. These patients will not respond to conventional thera -\\npies, including bronchodilators and corticosteroids. The vast \\nmajority of patients with TEF have additional birth anoma -\\nlies. This type of TEF may be difficult to demonstrate by \\nconventional radiographic studies, but a high-resolution CT \\nis often used for the diagnosis. Bronchoscopy may also be \\nuseful.52\\nIn a preschool-age patient with an acute onset of wheeze, \\ncough, or both, FB aspiration must be considered. On physi -\\ncal examination, the wheezing will often be unilateral or \\nlocalized. A forced expiratory chest radiograph may demon -\\nstrate air trapping behind the FB. The diagnosis is confirmed \\nby bronchoscopy and removal of the FB. Typically, patients \\npresent with acute respiratory symptoms, but chronic symp -\\ntoms or a history of infiltrate or pneumonia that fails to clear \\ncan also occur.53\\nPatients with CF classically present with a history of \\nrecurrent respiratory symptoms in association with systemic \\nsymptoms of failure to thrive, diarrhea, and recurrent sinus TABLE 6.2\\nDifferential Diagnosis of Recurrent Wheezing\\nUpper Airway Conditions\\n1.

Additionally, there are many more mild \\nvariants of classic CF that may not have associated systemic \\nsymptoms. Therefore, in patients with recurrent pneumonia \\nor those that have failed to respond to conventional therapies, \\none should consider CF in the differential diagnosis.54\\nImmunodeficiency presenting with recurrent wheeze, \\ncough, or both without superimposed infections, diarrhea, \\nrash, or failure to thrive is quite rare. Immunodeficiency \\nshould not be considered in the initial differential diagno -\\nsis of a young child with only recurrent wheeze, cough, or \\nboth.\\nSUMMARY\\nThe diagnosis of asthma in childhood is primarily based on \\nthe frequency, quality, variability, and severity of the symp -\\ntoms in addition to a family history and other allergic comor -\\nbidities (Table 6.1). Although predicting the likelihood of \\npersistent asthma in a preschool-age child with recurrent or \\npersistent respiratory symptoms is difficult, the presence of \\nseveral risk factors including a personal history of eczema or \\nallergic rhinitis, a parental history of asthma, positive allergy \\nskin tests, and the persistence of symptoms without viral ill -\\nnesses will aid in the diagnosis. The response to therapy can \\nbe especially helpful in younger children where pulmonary \\nfunction testing may not be feasible. The differential diag -\\nnosis of recurrent wheezing is large especially in younger \\nchildren and testing to rule out other conditions should be \\nperformed in a thoughtful manner (Table 6.2). Alternative \\ndiagnoses or comorbid conditions such as GERD, tracheo -\\nmalacia, or CF must be appropriately evaluated and treated. \\nFinally, a number of tests are available to support a diag -\\nnosis of asthma and the risk of future asthma, such as skin \\nprick testing, blood work documenting atopy (eosinophilia \\nor elevated IgE levels), or even documentation of bronchial \\nhyperresponsiveness.\\nThe keys to the diagnosis of asthma in children include a \\nhigh index of suspicion as 80% of asthma starts before the \\nage of 5 years.55 The clinical course will reflect the variability \\nof childhood asthma with some patients having long periods \\nof quiescent symptoms. This should not prevent appropriate \\ndiagnoses and treatment when supported by the appropriate \\nclinical presentation.\\nREFERENCES\\n 1. Akinbami LJ, Moorman JE, Garbe PL, et al.

He denied any wheezing or chest pain. \\nHis symptoms were worsened when exposed to extremes of \\ntemperature. He was previously a smoker, having smoked \\n25 pack-years, but had stopped smoking 4 years before, at \\nwhich time he had presented to the emergency department \\nwith an acute myocardial infarction, which was managed \\nwith coronary angioplasty. His current medications were a \\nbeta-blocker, a statin, and daily low-dose aspirin. He had \\nno history of atopic disease, nor any relevant family history. \\nHe had been told that he had episodes of “bronchitis” as a \\nyoung child, but he remembers very little detail about these \\nepisodes.\\nInitial investigations included a chest x-ray (CXR), which \\nwas normal, and spirometry, which showed a forced expira -\\ntory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and a forced vital capacity \\n(FVC) of 1.9 and 4.4 L, respectively (ratio 43%) with normal \\nvalues of 3.9/4.7 L. After inhaled beta2-agonist treatment, \\nthe values were 2.0/4.5 L, showing no acute reversibility in \\nairflow obstruction. Skin prick testing to common environ -\\nmental allergens showed a positive response to house-dust mites and grass pollen. Blood tests included a complete blood \\ncount and electrolytes, which were normal (no increase in \\nblood eosinophils) and his total immunoglobulin E (IgE) \\nwas slightly elevated at 230. Thus, the patient presented with \\nsevere airflow obstruction and a long previous smoking his -\\ntory, atopy, and a history in childhood consistent with mild \\nasthma.\\nA decision was made to begin treatment with a course \\nof oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 50 mg/day) for 3 weeks \\nand a combination inhaler containing an inhaled corticoste -\\nroid (ICS) and a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist (LABA) \\nadministered twice daily. At his return clinic visit, his symp -\\ntoms had markedly improved; his cough was no longer trou -\\nblesome at night and his spirometry demonstrated values of \\n3.0/4.6 L (a 58% improvement in FEV1). The diagnosis was \\nestablished as asthma, but with residual airflow obstruc -\\ntion, possibly related to his history of cigarette smoking. \\nThe prednisolone was discontinued, he was switched from a \\nbeta-blocker to an angiotensin receptor antagonist, and the \\ncombination inhaler was continued. He was left on low-dose \\naspirin, as he had no history of worsening symptoms while \\ntaking this medication.

Establishing the diagnosis can often be straightforward, \\nparticularly in older children, but it can be troublesome in \\npreschool children and older adults because of the difficulty \\nin obtaining objective evidence of variable airflow obstruc -\\ntion in younger children, and because of the possible pres -\\nence of other diseases, which can present with symptoms \\nsimilar to asthma, in older adults.\\nrole of MedIcal hIstory  In establ IshIng a dIagnos Is\\nPatients with asthma seek medical attention because of respi -\\nratory symptoms. A typical feature of asthma symptoms is \\ntheir variability. These symptoms are wheezing, chest tight -\\nness, episodic shortness of breath, and/or cough.1 Importantly, \\nhowever, none of these symptoms are diagnostic of asthma, \\nbecause similar symptoms can be present with other respira -\\ntory or even cardiac diseases (Table\\xa0 7.1). It is important to \\nelicit whether the symptoms are triggered or worsened by fac -\\ntors such as exercise, exposure to allergens, viral infections, and emotions, which would suggest a diagnosis of asthma. In \\nsome asthmatics (particularly children), wheezing and chest \\ntightness are absent, and the only symptom that the patient \\ncomplains of is chronic cough. This has been labeled cough-\\nvariant asthma3; however, this terminology is not often used \\nnow because, with a careful history, other symptoms consis -\\ntent with asthma are often elicited. Since the symptoms of \\nasthma are nonspecific, the differential diagnosis is quite \\nextensive, and the main goal for the physician is to consider \\nand exclude other possible diagnoses (Table 7.1). The lack of \\nspecificity of the symptoms of asthma also makes it essential \\nthat the diagnosis is made using objective measures of airflow \\nobstruction. This is even more important if the response to a \\ntrial of therapy has been negative.\\nAsthma clusters in families and its genetic determinants \\nappear to be linked to those of other allergic IgE-mediated \\ndiseases.4 Thus, a personal or a family history of asthma and/\\nor allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, or eczema increases the \\nlikelihood of a diagnosis of asthma.\\nPhysical activity is an important cause of symptoms for \\nmost asthma patients, particularly children, and for some it \\nis the only cause. Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction does \\nnot usually develop during exercise, but 5–10 minutes after -\\nward, and it resolves spontaneously within 30–45 minutes.5 \\nThe prompt relief of symptoms after the use of an inhaled \\nbeta2-agonist, or their prevention by pretreatment with an \\ninhaled beta2-agonist before exercise, supports a diagnosis \\nof asthma.\\nThe important aspects of a personal history are exposure to \\nagents that are known to worsen asthma in the home, such as \\ndusty environments, forced air heating systems, or exposure \\nto allergens (e.g., pets, house-dust mites, and cockroaches) to \\nwhich the patient is sensitized; workplace conditions, envi -\\nronmental tobacco smoke, or even the general environment \\n(e.g., fumes from traffic). In adult patients, a careful occupa -\\ntion history is essential to decide whether there is a possible \\noccupational sensitizer that is responsible for the onset of \\nasthma. Several hundred different agents have been recog -\\nnized to cause occupational asthma6, only some of which are \\nclassical allergens, causing asthma through IgE-dependent \\nmechanisms.\\nphysIcal exaMInatIon\\nIn mild asthma, a physical examination is usually not helpful, \\nas it is normal under stable conditions, but becomes charac -\\nteristically abnormal during asthma exacerbations. Typical \\nphysical signs during an asthma exacerbation are wheezing \\non auscultation, cough, and signs of acute hyperinflation (e.g., \\npoor diaphragmatic excursion at percussion and use of the \\naccessory muscles of respiration). In some asthmatics, wheez -\\ning may only be detectable on forced expiration, or it may \\neven be absent in the presence of very severe airflow obstruc -\\ntion. In these patients, however, the severity of their asthma is \\nmostly indicated by other signs, such as cyanosis, drowsiness, \\ndifficulty in speaking, tachycardia, a\\xa0hyperinflated chest, use \\nof the accessory muscles, and intercostal recession.TABLE 7.1\\nDifferential Diagnosis of Asthma\\nPulmonary COPD\\nSarcoidosis\\nEosinophilic bronchitis\\nPulmonary eosinophilia\\nCystic fibrosis\\nBronchiectasis\\nNeoplastic Lung cancer\\nEndobronchial tumors\\nLymphoma with hilar adenopathy\\nCardiovascular Left ventricular failure\\nPulmonary embolism\\nOther pathologies Gastroesophageal reflux/aspiration\\nInhaled foreign body\\nV ocal cord dysfunction\\nMedication (e.g., angiotensin-\\nconverting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors)', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 84}),\n"," Document(page_content='67 Diagnosis of Asthma in Older Children and Adults\\nlung funct Ion tests\\nWhile respiratory symptoms suggest asthma, the sine qua \\nnon for the diagnosis of asthma is the presence of reversible \\nairflow obstruction and/or airway hyperresponsiveness or \\nincreased peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability in subjects \\nwithout airways obstruction.1\\nSpirometry\\nLung function tests play a critical role in both the diagnosis \\nand follow-up of patients with asthma. Spirometric measure -\\nments, FEV1 and slow vital capacity (VC) or FVC, are the \\nstandard means for assessing airflow limitation (Figure 7.1). \\nFEV1, FVC, and the ratio of these two numbers are the mea -\\nsurements most widely used to document airflow obstruction. \\nThis is because they are the most reliable (reproducible and \\nresponsive) of all the measurements of lung function. The \\nAmerican Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory \\nSociety have published guidelines on the standardization of \\nthe measurement of spirometry and its interpretation.7 The \\nmeasurements, however, are mainly a reflection of larger air -\\nways obstruction. Other measurements that can be obtained \\nfrom a spirogram include flows at lower lung volumes, such as \\nthe forced expiratory flow 25%–75% (FEF25–75), which may \\nbetter reflect smaller airways obstruction; however, these \\nmeasurements are much less reliable than FEV1, and are not \\noften used clinically for this reason. In addition, almost all \\nof the studies that have related lung function measurements \\nto other clinical outcomes, morbidity, quality of life, or even \\nmortality in patients with airflow obstruction have used FEV1 \\nas the reference measurement. Spirometry is recommended \\nat the time of initial diagnosis and for the assessment of the \\nseverity of asthma.1 It should be repeated to monitor the disease and when there is a need for a reassessment, such \\nas during exacerbations. Spirometry can usually be reliably \\nperformed in children as young as 7 years, and sometimes \\neven younger than that age.8\\nThe airflow limitation is usually defined by the absolute \\nreduction of a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of <0.7. \\nHowever, because this parameter decreases with aging, it \\nshould be confirmed by postbronchodilator FEV1/VC values \\nbelow the lower limit of age-corrected normal values. Other \\npulmonary function measurements, such as the measurement \\nof lung volumes and the gas transfer capacity, may be useful \\nin determining the degree of hyperinflation and/or enlarge -\\nment of the airspaces, and these may help in the differential \\ndiagnosis with COPD, but are not necessary for the diagnosis \\nor the assessment of the severity of asthma.\\nPeak Expiratory Flow\\nIf spirometry does not reveal airflow limitation at the time of \\nthe initial assessment of the patient, then home monitoring of \\nPEF for 2 weeks may help to detect an increased variability \\nof the airway caliber, and assist in making the diagnosis of \\nasthma.9 Daily monitoring of PEF (at least in the morning on \\nawakening and in the evening hours, preferably both before \\nand after bronchodilator inhalation) is also useful to assess \\nthe severity of asthma and its response to treatment, and it \\ncan help patients to detect early signs of asthma deteriora -\\ntion. Diurnal variability is calculated as follows:\\n PEFP EF\\nPEFP EFmax min\\nmax min/−×\\n+100\\n2\\nA diurnal variability of PEF of more than 20% is diagnos -\\ntic of asthma, and the magnitude of the variability is broadly \\nproportional to the disease severity.10 PEF monitoring may \\nbe of use not only in establishing a diagnosis of asthma and \\nassessing its severity but also in uncovering an occupational \\ncause for asthma.11 When used in this way, PEF should be \\nmeasured more frequently than twice daily and special atten -\\ntion should be paid to changes occurring in and outside the \\nworkplace.\\nrevers IbIlIty to bronchod Ilators\\nAs already discussed, the demonstration of reversible airflow \\nobstruction is required for a diagnosis of asthma and a single \\ndemonstration of reversibility, defined as >12% reversibility \\nand >200 mL in FEV1 after bronchodilator inhalation, can \\nestablish the diagnosis1,12 (Figure 7.1). However, reversibility \\nis often not present, particularly in patients on treatment, and \\nthus the absence of reversibility does not exclude the diagno -\\nsis. Repeated testing of the reversibility of both clinical fea -\\ntures and functional abnormalities may be useful in obtaining \\nthe best level of asthma control achievable and/or the best lung \\nfunction for individual patients. Achieving and maintaining \\nlung function at the best possible level is one of the objectives \\nof asthma management.1,125\\n4\\n3\\n2\\n1\\n0\\n12 3\\nTime (s ec)FEV1\\nAfter inhale d beta2-agonist\\nBefore inhale d beta2-agonist\\n4 5Volume (L)\\nFIGURE 7.1  (See color insert)  Measurements of FEV1 before and \\n10 minutes after an inhaled beta2-agonist in an asthmatic patient. \\nThe FEV1 value was 1.7 L before and 2.3 L after the inhaled beta2-\\nagonist.

In asthmatic subjects, airway hyperre -\\nsponsiveness is present to many chemical or physical stimuli, \\nsuch as inhaled histamine,13 or the inhaled cholinergic ago -\\nnist methacholine,14 as well as physical stimuli such as exer -\\ncise,15 hyperventilation of cold dry air,16 and both hypotonic \\nand hypertonic solutions, such as mannitol.17 The metha -\\ncholine inhalation challenge is the most widely used test \\nto document airway hyperresponsiveness, and an abnormal \\nmethacholine challenge test can be demonstrated in almost \\nall patients with current symptomatic asthma.2 However, \\ndefining an exact level of airway responsiveness, which \\nwould distinguish asthmatic subjects from nonasthmatic \\nsubjects, is not possible because of a continuous distribu -\\ntion of airway responsiveness in the general population, with \\nasthmatic subjects in one tail of this distribution. In addition, \\neven subjects with a normal methacholine airway responsive -\\nness can develop symptomatic asthma if they are exposed \\nto a specific stimuli to which they are sensitized, such as an \\ninhaled allergen.18 The severity of airway hyperresponsive -\\nness correlates with the severity of asthma, as determined \\nby the amount of treatment needed to control asthma,14 with \\na variability in PEF,19 and an improvement in FEV1 after an \\ninhaled bronchodilator.19\\nOther challenge tests that are used to clinically docu -\\nment airway hyperresponsiveness include inhaled manni -\\ntol,20 exercise,5 and eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea,5 which \\nare considered “indirect” challenge procedures, causing bronchoconstriction by releasing bronchoconstrictor media -\\ntors from inflammatory cells in the airways.\\nThe measurements of airway hyperresponsiveness are \\nparticularly useful in patients with a normal airway caliber \\nin whom a diagnosis of asthma is being considered; how -\\never, they are not useful in the presence of an irreversible \\nairflow limitation, thereby aiding in the differential diagnosis \\nbetween asthma and COPD. Another important application \\nof measuring airway responsiveness is the diagnosis of occu -\\npational asthma.21 Lastly, the measurement of airway respon -\\nsiveness may be useful in determining the optimal treatment \\nrequirements in asthma.22\\nAllergy Tests\\nThe presence of allergic disorders in a patient’s family his -\\ntory should be investigated in all patients with symptoms of \\nasthma. Such a history provides important information about \\nthe patient’s lifestyle and occupation, both of which influence \\nthe patient’s exposure to allergens and the time and factors pos -\\nsibly involved in the onset and exacerbations of asthma.4 Skin \\ntests with all relevant allergens present in the geographic area \\nin which the patient lives are the primary diagnostic tool in \\ndetermining the allergic status of the patient. The main limita -\\ntion of the methods to assess the patient’s allergic status is that \\na positive test does not necessarily mean that asthma is allergic \\nin nature or that it is causing asthma, as some individuals have \\nspecific IgE antibodies without any symptoms and allergy may \\nnot be causally involved. The relevant exposure and its relation \\nto the symptoms must be confirmed by patient history.\\naddItIonal tests\\nWhile the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of asthma \\ncan be fully established on the basis of a clinical history and \\nlung function tests, additional tests are sometimes helpful to \\nbetter characterize individual patients.\\nImaging\\nWhile chest radiography may be useful to exclude diseases \\nthat may mimic asthma (Table 7.1), it is not required in the \\nconfirmation of the diagnosis of asthma. The utility of chest \\nradiography is to exclude other conditions that may imitate \\nor complicate asthma. Examples include pneumonia, car -\\ndiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary thromboembolism, \\ntumors (especially those that result in airway obstruction \\nwith resulting peripheral atelectasis), and pneumothorax.\\nAssessment of Airway Inflammation\\nWhile airway biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage may pro -\\nvide useful information in research protocols, they are con -\\nsidered too invasive for the diagnosis or staging of asthma.

In most patients, their \\nclinical presentation and history provide the strongest diag -\\nnostic criteria to distinguish these conditions (Table 7.2). The \\nresults of pulmonary function tests, particularly spirometric \\nmeasurements that show a nearly complete reversibility of \\nairflow limitation, will confirm a diagnosis of asthma, and \\nmeasurements that show poorly reversible airflow limitation \\nmay help to confirm the diagnosis of COPD (Table 7.2). The \\ndifferential diagnosis between asthma and COPD becomes \\nmore difficult in elderly patients, in whom some features may \\noverlap, such as smoking and atopy, and when the patient has \\nairflow limitation that is poorly reversible after treatment. In \\nthese cases, symptoms, lung function, airway responsiveness, \\nimaging, and even pathological findings may overlap and thus \\nmay not provide solid information to establish the diagnosis. \\nBecause an accurate diagnosis is needed to provide better \\ntreatment, it is important in these cases to undertake an indi -\\nvidual approach and to perform additional tests. Reversibility to corticosteroids alone or in combination with long-acting \\nbronchodilators, measurements of lung volumes and diffu -\\nsion capacity, an analysis of sputum and FeNO, and imaging \\nof the chest may demonstrate whether asthma or COPD is the \\npredominant cause of airflow limitation (Table 7.3).\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThe diagnosis of asthma in older children and adults is made \\nby the presence of symptoms consistent with asthma and the \\ndemonstration of variable airflow obstruction. The presence \\nof the characteristic symptoms alone is not sufficient for \\nan accurate diagnosis, as these are not specific for asthma. \\nVariable airflow obstruction is usually documented by dem -\\nonstrating changes in spirometry, particularly FEV1 and \\nVC, and the ratio of these numbers. The currently accepted \\ndefinition of an improvement in FEV1 that is consistent with \\nasthma is >12% and >200 mL. This is often demonstrated \\nwithin 10–30 minutes after the inhalation of a beta2-agonist, \\nsuch as salbutamol. In some instances, however, an improve -\\nment in FEV1 is only demonstrated after a more prolonged \\nperiod of treatment with inhaled or oral corticosteroids (as \\nin the case presentation). In patients with mild asthma, or \\nthose on an effective treatment, spirometry can be normal. In \\nthese situations, measurements of PEF over several weeks, or \\nthe documentation of airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled \\nchemical mediators, such as methacholine, or bronchocon -\\nstriction after exercise or inhaled mannitol, can establish the \\ndiagnosis.\\nMaking the diagnosis of asthma can be challenging in \\npatients (particularly younger children) who cannot repro -\\nducibly perform spirometry, and in adults with a smoking \\nhistory and in whom there is fixed airflow obstruction (not \\nreversible even after optimal treatment has been admin -\\nistered for a period of time).

For example, the highest grass pollen \\nlevels in the United Kingdom are at the end of June (early \\nsummer). As the air cools in the evening, pollen descends \\nand the levels inspired can be very high, particularly when \\nexercising. Rhinitis is defined by the presence of two or more \\nof the following nasal symptoms: rhinorrhea, congestion, \\nitching, and sneezing. It can be allergic, nonallergic, infec -\\ntive, or a combination of these.4 In children, allergy accounts \\nfor the majority of rhinitis cases; while in adults, allergy causes approximately one-third of cases. It is estimated that \\n25% of young people in the United Kingdom have rhinitis, \\nwhich is similar to the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in other \\nwesternized countries.\\nAllergic rhinitis is associated with a biphasic immuno -\\nlogic response to an allergen, similar to that seen in allergic \\nasthma. An early-phase reaction occurs almost immediately \\nafter an allergen exposure due to immunoglobulin E (IgE)-\\nmediated mast cell degranulation and the release of chemical \\nmediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglan -\\ndins. The late-phase reaction occurs several hours later, last -\\ning for 12–24 hours, and is associated with the activation of T \\ncells and the recruitment, activation, and prolonged survival \\nof eosinophils in the nasal mucosa.5 The resulting immedi -\\nate symptoms in the nose are itching, sneezing, and rhinor -\\nrhea. The late phase gives rise to nasal obstruction, a reduced \\nsense of smell, and general hyperreactivity, which can extend \\nthroughout the respiratory tract.6,7\\nAsthma tends to be more severe in patients with perennial \\nallergic rhinitis.8 Allergic rhinitis induced bronchial hyperre -\\nactivity can be reduced by the use of nasal corticosteroids.9,10 \\nConcurrent rhinitis in asthma patients is associated with \\nmore asthma-related primary care visits and hospital refer -\\nrals, and higher costs.11–13\\nEpidemiological and pathophysiological studies show \\nthat rhinitis and asthma frequently coexist with over 80% of TABLE 8.1\\nEvidence for a Link between Rhinitis and Asthma and Postulated Mechanisms of Their Interaction\\nEvidence References\\nepidemiological\\nApproximately 20%–60% of patients with allergic rhinitis have clinical asthma, whereas >80% of patients with allergic asthma have \\nconcomitant rhinitis symptoms.8,14–16\\nThe presence of rhinitis predicts the onset of asthma. 15\\nWorsening rhinitis negatively affects the course of asthma. 8,11–13,31\\nTreating rhinitis reduces the incidence of asthma exacerbations. 33–35\\nPathological\\nAllergic rhinitis patients have evidence of subclinical airways obstruction and inflammation even in the absence of overt asthma. 19,20\\nAsthmatic patients have evidence of upper airway inflammation even in the absence of overt rhinitis. 22\\nAllergen challenge specifically in the nasal or bronchial airways leads to marked inflammatory responses in the upper and lower \\nairways, respectively.6,23–25\\nAllergens and aspirin can trigger exacerbations of both asthma and rhinitis and lead to inflammatory responses, involving increased \\nexpression of Th2 cytokines.5,7,26\\nNasal allergen challenge leads to the production of circulating Th2 effector cells responsible for promoting lower airways inflammation \\nin mice.7\\nTreating the upper airway with intranasal steroids reduces bronchial hyperresponsiveness. 9,10\\nPossible Mechanisms of Upper and Lower Airway Interaction\\nAbsence of nasal functions—filtering, warming, and humidifying inspired air—allows direct contact of cold, polluted air with the lower \\nairway epithelium.\\nSpread of inflammation from one site to another via airways or systemically.\\nReflex activation of nerves by inflammation.\\nAlteration of nitric oxide levels in nose may affect the larynx and bronchi.\\nPostnasal dripping of infected material, cytokines, and mediators passes to the stomach so they are unlikely to affect the lungs.\\nSource:  Adapted from Scadding, G., Walker, S., Prim.

Useful \\ndiagnostic questionnaires are available at www.whiar.org.\\nDIAGNOSIS OF RHINITIS\\ntaKIng a specIfIc hIstory\\nRhinitis can be broadly divided into three categories: aller -\\ngic, infective, and nonallergic. Sneezing, an itchy nose and \\npalate, and eye involvement suggest allergic rhinitis, although \\nsymptoms alone cannot differentiate between allergic and \\nnonallergic subtypes. The personal and family history of any \\nallergic disease makes a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis more \\nlikely. The symptoms on exposure to relevant triggers such as \\npets, mold, and seasonal or occupational allergens may give \\na further indication of the probable causes.4 To guide subse -\\nquent treatment, it is important to ask if the symptoms are \\nintermittent or persistent, and mild or moderate to severe36 \\n(Figure 8.1). A previous study demonstrated that patients with rhinitis symptoms beginning later in life (age >35), no family \\nhistory of allergies, no seasonality, and no symptoms around \\nfurry pets or odorants such as fragrances and perfumes had \\na greater than 98% likelihood of having nonallergic rhinitis \\nbefore allergy skin and/or serology-specific IgE testing.37\\nphysIcal exaMInatIon\\nObservation of the patient for signs of sniffing, nose rubbing, \\nreduced nasal airflow, mouth breathing, and a transverse skin \\ncrease across the dorsum of the nose is helpful in determining \\nthe presence of rhinitis. Patients with rhinitis may have ery -\\nthematous eyes and “allergic shiners,” which are a manifesta -\\ntion of chronic venous congestion. It is important to examine \\nthe nasal mucosa using a speculum and a head-mounted lamp, \\nan endoscope if available, or simply use an otoscope with the \\nlargest earpiece. The nasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis is typi -\\ncally watery, swollen, and a slightly blue-gray shade of red. \\nAdditional features suggesting alternative diagnoses include \\nthe presence of nasal polyps (pale, shiny, white-gray, grapelike \\nstructures, often originating close to the middle turbinate), crust -\\ning, bleeding, septal perforation, mucopurulent discharge, and, \\nfrom external observation, the presence of nasal bridge collapse \\nor lupus pernio.

In primary care, if skin prick tests are not avail -\\nable, serum-specific IgE tests may be requested. It should \\nbe kept in mind that both skin and serum tests alone iden -\\ntify allergic “sensitization”; however, a diagnosis of allergy \\nrequires positive tests to correlate with the patient’s clinical \\nhistory. Therefore, performing numerous screening tests in \\nthe absence of a compatible history is not recommended. \\nRecently, a large, cross-sectional study used an irritant index \\nquestionnaire to reclassify patients with a physician diag -\\nnosis of allergic, nonallergic, or mixed rhinitis. The study \\nfound that both allergic and nonallergic rhinitis patients with \\na high-irritant burden had a significantly greater likelihood \\nof having a diagnosis of asthma compared with allergic and \\nnonallergic rhinitis patients with a low-irritant burden. This \\nstudy indicates that quantifying the irritant burden in rhinitis \\npatients results in distinct, “more severe” rhinitis phenotypes \\nthat may represent the “difficult-to-treat” rhinitis patient.38\\nAdditional investigations that may aid in the diagnosis \\nand identification of the cause of rhinitis refractory to con -\\nventional treatment include:\\n• Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation \\nrate (ESR), and differential white cell count\\n• C-reactive protein, if chronic infection is suspected\\n• Thyroid function tests\\n• Urine toxicology—if cocaine abuse is suspected\\nPeak expiratory flow measurements and spirometry should \\nbe considered for all patients with anything more than mild, \\nintermittent rhinitis to screen for an airway obstruction \\nsince allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for asthma. A diag -\\nnosis of asthma is more complicated and may be confused \\nby symptoms of cough caused by rhinitis and postnasal \\ndrip, leading to either an inaccurate diagnosis or overtreat -\\nment of asthma. Few self-administered questionnaires are \\ncurrently available for the assessment of both disorders.39 \\nRHINASTHMA is a 30-item questionnaire, which differ -\\nentiates between patients with rhinitis and patients with \\ncomorbid rhinitis and asthma, as well as controlled and \\nuncontrolled asthma in asthmatic patients with symptom -\\natic or nonsymptomatic rhinitis.40\\nMANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH \\nCOMORBID RHINITIS AND ASTHMA\\nIncreasing evidence suggests that the better management of \\nrhinitis may result in decreased asthma comorbidity and an \\nimproved quality of life.33–35,41 This includes:\\n• Allergen and irritant identification and avoidance\\n• Pharmacological treatment\\n• Immunotherapy\\n• Patient educationallergen  avoIdance\\nTo date, the results of meta-analyses of allergen avoidance \\nstudies, particularly for house-dust mites, have been disap -\\npointing.42 However, this may, in part, be due to method -\\nological problems related to many of the published studies. \\nIf sufficient avoidance can be achieved, for example by \\nrelocating patients to a high altitude,43 improvements in \\nsymptoms, lung function, and allergen-induced bronchial \\nhyperreactivity can be demonstrated. In real-life settings, \\nallergen avoidance can be effective: one inner-city study \\nof children with asthma, involving multiple intervention \\nmeasures, proved effective,44 whereas another study utiliz -\\ning a single intervention measure with allergen-impregna -\\nble bedcovers proved ineffective.45 There is evidence for \\na reduction of nose and eye symptoms by: nasal air filters \\ncompared with placebo filters in a pollen season study46; \\nanother placebo-controlled study demonstrated a reduction \\nof both asthma and rhinitis symptoms using a nocturnal \\nlaminar airflow device, which removes particulate matter, \\nincluding allergens, from the patients’ breathing space47; \\nand saline nasal douching, which reduces symptoms and \\ninflammatory mediators simply by washing allergens out \\nof the nose.48,49\\npharMacotherapy\\nIntranasal Corticosteroids\\nThe current guidelines recommend the treatment of rhi -\\nnitis according to an algorithm based on symptom fre -\\nquency and severity (Figures 8.2 and 8.3). For any form \\nof allergic rhinitis that is more than mild and intermittent, \\ntopical intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) are the first-line \\nmedication of choice. Meta-analyses have demonstrated \\nthese drugs to be more effective than antihistamines (oral \\nor topical), antileukotrienes, and the combination of anti -\\nhistamine plus antileukotriene.50–53 Topical corticosteroids \\nreduce all nasal symptoms, including nasal obstruction, \\nand they have also been shown to be beneficial for associ -\\nated eye symptoms.54\\nSystemic absorption is very low with nasal mometasone \\nand fluticasone, with good long-term safety data in children \\nand adults, but it is high for nasally administered betametha -\\nsone and dexamethasone.55 Although INCS may have a fast \\nonset of action (within 6–8 hours), the maximal improvement \\nin symptoms may not occur for at least 2 weeks. Minor nose \\nbleeding may occur in 5%–8% of patients and result in the \\nneed for discontinuation. This adverse effect can be reduced \\nby judicious use of the spray, aiming the nozzle placed just \\ninside the nose toward the lateral wall of the nasal cavity and \\nspraying in two different directions; upward and backward. \\nSniffing should be avoided as this pulls the spray straight \\nback to the posterior pharynx and triggers swallowing. Very \\nrarely, hypothalamic–pituitary axis suppression may occur \\nwith long-term use and guidelines advise monitoring growth \\nin children.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 92}),\n"," Document(page_content='75 United Airways\\nAntihistamines\\nAntihistamines are useful for mild symptoms, either inter -\\nmittent or persistent. In the latter case, regular daily use \\nis advisable because when they are withdrawn the hista -\\nmine receptor becomes more active and the symptoms can \\nincrease. Antihistamines are active against sneezing, rhinor -\\nrhea, and nasal itch, but are inferior to nasal corticosteroids \\nin reducing nasal congestion. Most second-generation oral \\nantihistamines (loratidine, cetirizine, fexofenadine, des -\\nloratidine, levocetirizine, misolastine, rupatadine) reduce \\nsymptoms within 1 hour and are used once daily. Acrivastine \\nis an exception to this rule; it has a rapid onset of action, but \\nlasts only 8 hours. Topical nasal antihistamines are available \\nas azelastine and olopatadine, which have a 15-minute onset \\nof action.\\nFirst-generation antihistamines, such as chlorphenamine, \\nmay cause sedation with a resultant reduction in work and \\nschool performance; therefore, these should be avoided.56 \\nSecond-generation antihistamines, especially fexofenadine, \\nhave a very low potential for sedation. All have few major \\ndrug interactions. Grapefruit impairs fexofenadine absorp -\\ntion and therefore should be avoided. The adverse effects of \\nazelastine include local irritation and taste disturbance.\\nCombination Therapy\\nIf the symptoms of rhinitis persist despite the use of anti -\\nhistamines or topical INCS alone, it is important to review \\nthe diagnosis, check concordance with the treatment, and \\ncheck the nasal spray technique. If the response remains \\npoor, then most practitioners would recommend combined \\ntreatment with both a topical nasal corticosteroid and a non -\\nsedating antihistamine, either oral or topical.4 A spray con -\\ntaining both fluticasone propionate and azelastine is superior \\nto either alone and is now available in the United States and \\nthe United Kingdom.other treat Ment optIons (fIgure 8.4)\\n• In cases of nasal blockage, the short-term use (i.e., \\n<10 days) of an intranasal decongestant (e.g., ephed -\\nrine, xylometazoline, or oxymetazoline) may be \\nbeneficial. Regular prolonged use of topical decon -\\ngestants leads to chronic nasal obstruction through \\ntachyphylaxis and should therefore be avoided. \\nHowever, recent studies have demonstrated that topi -\\ncal decongestants are well tolerated and do not cause \\nrhinitis medicamentosa (nasal congestion rebound) \\nwhen used in conjunction with an INCS. Oral decon -\\ngestants, such as phenylephrine, show poor efficacy \\nand cause adverse effects, and therefore are not rec -\\nommended for long-term use.57,58\\n• Oral leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) may \\nbe beneficial in patients with mild rhinitis, particu -\\nlarly in patients with comorbid asthma.\\n• Topical anticholinergic preparations such as ipratro -\\npium bromide may be beneficial in reducing rhinor -\\nrhea, particularly in the treatment of nonallergic \\n(vasomotor) or allergic rhinitis.\\n• Topical sodium cromoglicate is modestly effective \\nbut it needs to be used three to four times a day. It is \\nused by clinicians in the treatment of small children.\\n• Cromone and antihistamine-containing eye drops \\ncan be used alone or in combination with oral/topi -\\ncal nonsedating antihistamines and INCS for ocular \\nsymptoms if required.\\n• Systemic corticosteroids should rarely be used, \\nbut they have a role in severe nasal obstruction as \\na short-term rescue medication, particularly for \\nimportant life events.

Information about therapy should be given, \\nincluding a demonstration of the nasal spray technique \\nwhere prescribed. Occupational rhinitis is considered a risk \\nfactor for occupational asthma and usually predates the \\nonset of asthma. Of particular relevance to the workplace \\nis primary prevention, particularly through the use of non -\\npowdered or nonlatex gloves, and the avoidance of other \\noccupational allergens known to cause sensitization (see \\nChapter 24). The superior efficacy and safety of the new-\\ngeneration topical corticosteroids should be highlighted for \\nthose patients who are reluctant to use these drugs. Patients \\nmay be reluctant to use corticosteroids at more than one \\nsite, the nose as well as the lungs, but the contribution to \\nthe total corticosteroid load from INCS is minute compared \\nwith that from bronchial inhalers. Conversely, the contribu -\\ntion from untreated rhinitis to the overall disease burden \\ncan be considerable. In some asthmatic patients, the addi -\\ntion of nasal therapy allows a reduction in the inhaled dose.\\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\\ntreat Ment In pregnancy\\nPregnancy-associated rhinitis is self-limiting and treatment \\nshould only be initiated if the benefit of the treatment out -\\nweighs the risk to the fetus.61 Saline nasal douching is safe \\nand may help. For allergic rhinitis, the INCS budesonide is \\npregnancy category B, but other INCS, such as beclometasone \\nand fluticasone, have been widely used by pregnant women \\nand are therefore considered safe. The second-generation \\nantihistamines, cetirizine, loratidine, and levocetirizine, are \\npregnancy category B, but other agents including fexofena -\\ndine, desloratidine, and the first-generation antihistamines \\nchlorphenamine and diphenhydramine have been used in \\npregnancy without reported adverse effects. Montelukast and \\nzafirlukast are both pregnancy category B and are therefore \\nconsidered safe to take during pregnancy. Conversely, decon -\\ngestants have been associated with teratogenic effects and \\nshould be avoided. Immunotherapy should not be initiated, \\nbut it can be continued during pregnancy (see Chapter\\xa027).\\ntreat Ment In chIldren\\nThe therapy for children includes antihistamines and nasal \\ncorticosteroids. Those with the lowest systemic bioavailabil -\\nity (budesonide, fluticasone, and mometasone) at the low -\\nest dose for effective symptom control should be used, with \\nmonitoring of growth if the treatment is given long term.\\nREFERRAL\\nTreatment failure, which occurs in some 20% of rhinitis \\npatients,62 should prompt a referral to either an allergist to \\nassess whether the patient has allergic, nonallergic, or mixed rhinitis, and/or to an otolaryngologist to rule out structural \\nabnormalities. The circumstances prompting referral to an \\nallergist include:\\n• Inadequate control of symptoms\\n• Recurrent nasal polyps\\n• Patient systemically unwell as a result of rhinitis\\n• Need for allergen or trigger identification or \\ndiagnosis\\n• Consideration of immunotherapy\\n• Presence of a multisystem allergy (e.g., rhinitis with \\nasthma, eczema, or food allergy)\\n• Occupational rhinitis\\nReferral to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) clinic should be \\nmade if there is/are:\\n• Unilateral symptoms and signs, such as nasal \\nobstruction (which may be due to a nasal tumor), \\nnasal perforation, or ulceration\\n• Thick, green nasal secretions, suggesting an acute \\nor recurrent infective rhinosinusitis\\n• Periorbital cellulitis (an emergency warranting an \\nurgent ENT referral)\\n• New-onset nasal polyps\\n• Significant nasal septal deviation or very enlarged \\nturbinates in someone who is unresponsive to \\ntreatment; surgical management may be required \\nto improve the nasal airway for access of topical \\nmedications\\n• Evidence of persistent nasal crusting, nasal collapse, \\nor bleeding from the nostrils, which may be signs of \\nsystemic disorders such as sarcoidosis or Wegener’s \\ngranulomatosis\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nRhinitis and asthma frequently occur as comorbid condi -\\ntions in adults and children as manifestations of the same \\ninflammatory disease continuum. Rhinitis is a predictor of \\nfuture asthma. It impacts negatively on asthma, leading to \\nmore severe disease, worse asthma control, and impaired \\nquality of life, despite adherence to asthma treatment. Good \\ntreatment of rhinitis is likely to improve asthma control and \\noutcomes. The WHO-ARIA recommendation is that patients \\nwith asthma and rhinitis should be treated for both condi -\\ntions. Relevant allergens and triggers should be sought and \\nexcluded. The combination of intranasal and inhaled cor -\\nticosteroids for persistent rhinitis and asthma should be \\nconsidered, with the addition of other drugs including anti -\\nhistamines, cromones, and LTRAs as appropriate. The over -\\nall corticosteroid load should be reviewed on a regular basis \\nto prevent unwanted side effects. Allergen-specific immuno -\\ntherapy for allergic rhinitis has the potential to prevent the \\ndevelopment of asthma.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 96}),\n"," Document(page_content='79 United Airways\\nREFERENCES\\n 1.

His parents ask \\nthe following questions:\\n• What is this patient’s risk of developing asthma?\\n• Will ICS therapy reduce his risk of developing \\nasthma?\\n• Why do other children in his day-care center not \\nwheeze with the same respiratory illness?\\nINTRODUCTION\\nRespiratory virus infections are the most common infec -\\ntions among infants, children, and adults, and these play an \\nimportant role in the development and onset of asthma.1–4 \\nKnowledge in these areas is rapidly growing due to the \\nrecent advances in virus detection methods, the discovery \\nof new viruses, and birth cohort studies.1,2 This chapter \\nwill focus on our current understanding of how respiratory \\nviruses may contribute to asthma inception and asthma \\nexacerbations, as well as identify areas in need of further \\nstudy.\\nADVANCES IN THE DETECTION \\nOF RESPIRATORY VIRUSES\\nAdvances in detecting respiratory viruses have provided \\nimportant insights into the relationship between viruses \\nand asthma. Conventional methods, including viral culture, \\nantigen detection using labeled antibodies, and serological \\nconversion, are insensitive for identifying viruses, yield -\\ning detection rates of 30%–50%.2 The advent of molecular \\ndetection techniques, including polymerase chain reaction \\n(PCR), reverse-transcriptase PCR, gene sequencing, and \\nmicroarrays, has yielded far superior viral detection rates \\n(as high as 90% of acute respiratory infections [ARI]).2,5 \\nThis advancement has resulted in the identification of \\nviruses as the main etiology of infant wheezing and asthma \\nexacerbations;2,3 the discovery of new classes of viruses, \\nincluding human metapneumoviruses (hMPVs), bocavi -\\nruses (hBoVs), and polyomaviruses (PyVs); the discovery \\nof new species of viruses such as human rhinovirus (HRV) \\nC; and the discovery of new strains of viruses such as the \\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus.1–3 \\nMany of these recently identified viruses are difficult or \\nimpossible to grow in the available tissue culture systems, \\nwhich explains why they have only been identified using \\nmolecular diagnostics.2 These newly discovered viruses \\nhave also been linked to wheezing illnesses and asthma \\nexacerbations (see Table 9.1).1,3,6 In summary, the molecu -\\nlar methods for virus detection have greatly advanced our \\nknowledge of respiratory viruses, and research employ -\\ning these techniques in asthma patients and birth cohorts \\nhas provided new insights in our understanding of asthma \\netiopathogenesis.VIRUSES AND ASTHMA INCEPTION\\nvIrus-Induced  wheez Ing and subsequent  asthMa\\nRespiratory virus infections are universal in early child -\\nhood.6 Up to one-half of children wheeze with a lower respi -\\nratory tract illness (LRTI) at least once before school age,6 \\nand respiratory viruses are the most frequent pathogens asso -\\nciated with these wheezing illnesses.7 Based on data from \\nthe Tucson Children’s Respiratory Study (TCRS), a U.S. \\nprospective birth cohort of over 1000 children, the timing \\nand the persistence of wheezing LRTIs in early life appear \\npredictive of a subsequent asthma risk.6,8,9 Over 60% of this \\ncohort were “transient wheezers,” who began wheezing \\nbefore 3 years of age, but ceased to have wheezing exacerba -\\ntions by age 6, and they were no more likely to wheeze at age \\n11 than those who never wheezed before age 3.6 In contrast, \\n“persistent wheezers” began wheezing before 3 years of age \\nand continued to wheeze at school age. These children had \\nreduced lung function at 6 years of age that persisted at least \\nthrough their teenage years.6,10 A German birth cohort of \\n1314 children found similar results.5\\nBased on the TCRS data, study investigators have devel -\\noped an index to predict the risk of developing asthma in \\nchildren who have recurrent wheezing ( ≥3 episodes of \\nwheezing in 1 year by age 3).8,9 The Asthma Predictive Index \\n(API) uses several criteria to predict the risk of asthma (see \\nTable\\xa09.2).8,9 A child is given a positive API score if he or she \\nhas recurrent wheezing and at least one major criterion or \\nat least two minor criteria of the API. In the TCRS, a posi -\\ntive API score by age 3 was associated with a 77% chance of \\nactive asthma from ages 6 to 13, while children with a nega -\\ntive API score at age 3 had less than a 3% chance of active \\nasthma during school age.9 Since the development of the API, TABLE 9.1\\nFamilies of Respiratory Viruses Linked to \\nAsthma Inception or Exacerbation\\nFamily\\nPicornaviridae\\nHuman rhinoviruses (HRVs)\\nEnteroviruses\\nOrthomyxoviridae\\nInfluenza viruses (IFVs)\\nParamyxoviridae\\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\\nParainfluenza viruses (PIV)\\nHuman metapneumovirus (hMPV)\\nCoronaviridae\\nHuman coronaviruses (HCoVs)\\nAdenoviridae\\nAdenoviruses (AdVs)\\nParvoviridae\\nHuman bocaviruses (HBoVs)\\nPolyomaviridae\\nPolyomaviruses (PyVs)', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 102}),\n"," Document(page_content='85 Viral Infections in Asthma\\nother asthma indices using birth cohorts from other nations \\nhave been developed.8\\nday care and vIrus-Induced  wheez Ing\\nThe Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study, a U.S. \\nprospective birth cohort of 285 children, found an associa -\\ntion between day-care attendance and an increased risk of \\nARI due to HRV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), \\nas well as an increased risk of HRV-induced wheezing in \\ninfants.11 TCRS investigators also reported an association \\nbetween day care and wheezing,12 but other studies have \\neither found no such association13 or they have found an \\ninverse association.14\\nHost differences may explain some of these discrepant \\nfindings. For example, genetic variants in the genes TLR2 , \\nFCER1B , and interleukin ( IL)-4RA  may modulate the risk of \\natopy and of wheezing associated with day care.15,16\\nrsv and asthMa Incept Ion\\nRSV, of the family Paramyxoviridae, is a common cause \\nof bronchiolitis and the leading cause of hospitalization for \\nchildren younger than 1 year old.2,3,5 A RSV infection is \\nseasonal, peaking during the winter months in the United \\nStates.2 Most children are infected with RSV by 2 years of \\nage,17 but fewer than one-half of children develop clinically \\nrecognized bronchiolitis, and only a small fraction develop \\nbronchiolitis severe enough to require hospitalization.17\\nRSV bronchiolitis in early life, especially the form of the \\nillness that is severe enough to require emergency department \\ncare or hospitalization, has been identified as a risk factor for \\nasthma in multiple studies.5,17,18 A retrospective study of over \\n95,000 infants enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program \\nfound that children born 120 days before the peak of the RSV \\nseason had the highest risk of hospitalization for LRTI, as well as the highest risk of asthma between 4 and 5.5 years \\nof age. In the COAST study, the development of RSV bron -\\nchiolitis between birth and age 3 was associated with an \\nodds ratio (OR) of 2.6 for asthma at age 6.19 This association \\nbetween RSV bronchiolitis and subsequent asthma has been \\nreplicated in multiple prospective cohorts.5,17,19,20 However, \\nthe results from other studies argue against an association2,5 \\nor indicate that RSV-associated asthma may subside by \\n13 years of age.21 Taken together, the relationship between \\nRSV and asthma inception remains controversial2,5 because \\nsevere RSV bronchiolitis may reflect a host phenotype that \\nis already predisposed to future asthma, rather than a causal \\nrelationship between RSV and asthma. Indeed, an inherited \\nsusceptibility to bacterial and viral infections throughout an \\nindividual’s lifetime may be a hallmark of asthma, as has \\nbeen extensively reviewed recently.22\\nhrv s and asthMa Incept Ion\\nHRVs, in the genus Enterovirus  of the Picornaviridae family, \\nare the predominant cause of the common cold in both chil -\\ndren and adults.3–5 Unlike RSVs, HRV infections may occur \\nthroughout the year, and are the leading cause of bronchiol -\\nitis outside of the winter RSV season.5 HRVs are also more \\nfrequently associated with wheezing than are RSVs, even in \\ninfants.3 Based on virus genome sequences, HRVs were ini -\\ntially divided into two groups (A and B), but a novel species \\nof HRV, called HRV group C (HRV-C),1,2 has been identified \\nby molecular techniques and linked to wheezing illnesses.1–3\\nStudies have linked HRV-associated wheezing illnesses in \\ninfancy to the development of asthma,3,5,19 and they have also \\nshown that HRV-associated wheezing is a stronger predic -\\ntor of asthma inception than RSV-associated wheezing.3,5,19 \\nFor example, the COAST study17 found that HRV-associated \\nwheezing during the first year of life was the most signifi -\\ncant predictor of wheezing at age 3 (OR = 10) and asthma \\nat age 6 (OR = 9.8);19,23 these children also had impaired \\nlung function at both time points.24 In the COAST study, the \\nrelationship between the risk of asthma and HRV-associated \\nwheezing in early life appeared to increase with each year of \\nage, such that subjects who had developed HRV-associated \\nwheezing by age 3 had an OR of 25.6 for developing asthma \\nby age 6.19 In contrast, an RSV-associated wheezing illness \\nby age 3 in the COAST study had an OR of 2.6 for developing \\nasthma by age 6.19 Similarly, a Tennessee study indicated that \\nbronchiolitis during the HRV-predominant months was asso -\\nciated with a 25% increased risk for childhood asthma over \\nbronchiolitis during the RSV-predominant months.25\\nSome evidence suggests that the risk of asthma follow -\\ning HRV-associated wheezing may be influenced by the \\npatient’s atopic status. In an Australian birth cohort of 263 \\nchildren, Kusel et al.26 found that a relationship between \\nHRV-associated wheezing in early life and the risk of asthma \\nat age 5 was only significant in subjects who had demon -\\nstrable atopy (by skin prick test) by age 2 (OR = 3.2), and not \\nin subjects who developed atopy after 2 years of age or who TABLE 9.2\\nAsthma Predictive Index (API) from Tucson \\nChildren’s Respiratory Study\\nMajor Criteria\\n1.

The neonatal mice exhibited a \\nslight immune response to HDM in the absence of IFV-A \\ninfection, but when HDM allergen exposure occurred con -\\ncurrently with IFV-A infection, these mice displayed robust \\nallergen-specific immunity, allergic inflammation, lung \\nremodeling, and impaired lung function.18,27 Lung remodel -\\ning persisted into early adulthood for these mice, long after \\nthe HDM allergen exposure had ceased.27 These data suggest \\na relationship between IFV and asthma in a mouse model, but \\nwhether this relationship exists in humans remains unknown.\\nother respIratory  vIruses and asthMa Incept Ion\\nLess is known regarding the role of other respiratory viruses \\nand the risk of developing asthma.1,7 Parainfluenza viruses \\n(PIVs), of the same Paramyxoviridae family as RSV, have \\nbeen associated with approximately 10% of wheezing ill -\\nnesses in children, and a possible association between PIV \\ninfection and asthma was reported in a Canadian birth cohort \\nstudy.28 Other studies have found adenoviruses (AdVs), \\nhuman bocaviruses (HBoVs), hMPVs, human coronaviruses \\n(HCoVs), and PyVs to be associated with childhood wheez -\\ning and bronchiolitis, but their role in the pathogenesis of \\nasthma is not yet known. The potential roles of HBoVs and \\nPyVs in the risk of asthma remain especially unclear, since \\nthese viruses are frequently codetected with other viruses \\nsuch as rhinoviruses and influenza.1,3,7\\nMECHANISMS BY WHICH VIRUSES \\nMAY CAUSE ASTHMA\\ndIMInIshed t-helper type 1 (th1) \\nhost IMMune response\\nEvidence suggests that a diminished antiviral immune \\nresponse may predispose individuals to asthma after a respi -\\nratory virus infection.5 Interferons (IFNs) are important in \\nthe human Th1 immune response to a virus infection, and \\nrespiratory viruses are known to upregulate IFN-responsive genes during an infection.29 Studies have shown that a \\ndiminished host production of IFN (IFN- α, IFN- β, IFN- γ, \\nand IFN- λ) correlated with wheezing and asthma following \\na viral infection.5,30–32 For example, the differences at birth \\nin the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) produc -\\ntion of IFN- γ in response to HRV and RSV have been shown \\nto correlate with wheezing in infancy, preschool age, and \\nschool age.30,31 Recent data have linked deficient IL-15 pro -\\nduction, a cytokine that helps connect innate immunity to \\nadaptive immunity during a viral infection, to the deficient \\nIFN response associated with asthma (Table 9.3).33\\nbIased t-helper type 2 (th2) h ost IMMune response\\nTh2 (“allergic”) inflammation is often associated with \\nasthma, and studies suggest that a host predisposition toward \\nan allergic Th2 immune response may also contribute to the \\ndevelopment of asthma after a respiratory virus infection.5 \\nFor instance, the COAST study found a stable production of \\nIL-13 (a key Th2 cytokine) by PBMC stimulated with phy -\\ntohemagglutinin over the first year of life in children who \\nwheezed with virus infections compared with those who did \\nnot wheeze with colds.30 More recently, another U.S. pro -\\nspective cohort study found that the strongest determinant of \\nasthma following RSV bronchiolitis was an elevated level of \\nnasal epithelial chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) (also \\nknown as regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed \\nand secreted chemokine [RANTES]), a Th2 chemokine.20\\nother host factors  that May predIspose to asthMa\\nOther components of the host immune system may contrib -\\nute to the risk of asthma following a respiratory virus infec -\\ntion. At 1 year of age, fewer host regulatory T cells (“Tregs”), \\nwhich suppress Th1 and Th2 inflammation, have been linked \\nto the risk of allergic sensitization at 1 and 2 years of age and \\nmay also mediate the risk of asthma.34 An impaired epithelial \\nbarrier (e.g., due to a diminished expression of the barrier \\nprotein filaggrin) is associated with atopic dermatitis, but it \\nmay also increase the risk of asthma in certain individuals,5 \\nalthough filaggrin is not expressed in the airways. Aside \\nfrom the epithelial barrier, other aspects of innate immunity, \\nsuch as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), may also play a role.15 \\nTABLE 9.3\\nMechanisms by Which Viruses May Cause Asthma\\nHost Factors\\nDiminished Th1 immune response\\nBiased Th2 immune response\\nFewer T regulatory cells\\nAltered innate immunity (including epithelial barrier)\\nDifferences in airway repair and remodeling\\nVirus Factors\\nAffect airway repair and remodeling\\nDrive Th2 immune response', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 104}),\n"," Document(page_content='87 Viral Infections in Asthma\\nFinally, host differences in airway repair and remodeling \\nmay also influence the risk of asthma following respiratory \\nvirus infections.35\\nvIrus factors  that May predIspose to asthMa\\nRespiratory viruses may increase the risk of asthma through \\nseveral pathways.

A small Finnish \\nretrospective study that involved children hospitalized for \\nRSV-induced wheezing found that oral prednisolone only \\ndecreased the risk of subsequent recurrent wheezing in sub -\\njects with atopic dermatitis.39 A U.S. retrospective study of \\nchildren with a physician’s diagnosis of chronic lung disease \\nor bronchopulmonary dysplasia found that subjects who had \\nreceived a monthly prophylaxis with RSV immune globulin \\nin infancy had better spirometry values and fewer asthma \\nattacks during school age compared with subjects who had \\nnot received RSV immune globulin.18 While the rates of \\nbronchial hyperreactivity, asthma diagnosis, and asthma \\nmedication use did not differ significantly between the two \\ngroups, a trend toward benefit was seen in the group treated with RSV immune globulin.18 Prospective studies are needed \\nto further evaluate the role of systemic corticosteroids and \\nRSV immune globulin in reducing the risk of asthma in such \\npatients.\\nOne European prospective controlled study has examined \\nthe effect of the anti-RSV monoclonal antibody (mAb) palivi -\\nzumab on the risk of asthma in premature infants ( <36 weeks \\ngestational age) who had received palivizumab as routine \\ncare for prematurity.40 The rates of RSV infection in the \\npalivizumab group were not tracked, although documented \\nRSV infection was accounted for in selecting the control sub -\\njects.40 Palivizumab decreased the risk of recurrent wheez -\\ning in nonatopic children by 80%, but showed no benefit for \\nchildren with a personal or a family history of atopy.40 These \\ninvestigators concluded that palivizumab was effective in \\nreducing the risk of recurrent wheezing in nonatopic chil -\\ndren, and suggested that RSV may predispose individuals to \\nasthma through an atopy-independent pathway.40\\ntherap Ies that May decrease  rIsK of \\nasthMa Incept Ion after hrv I nfect Ion\\nCurrently, there is no strategy available for the successful \\nprevention of ARI caused by HRV.2 Finnish investigators \\nevaluated prednisolone therapy in 40 children (mean age \\n1.38 years) hospitalized for their first or second episode of \\nHRV-associated wheezing, and found that oral prednisolone \\ndecreased the risk of recurrent wheezing in the following \\nyear compared with a placebo (OR 0.19; 95% confidence \\ninterval [CI] 0.05–0.71; see also Table 9.4).39 Larger studies \\nare needed to confirm this benefit. The efficacy of ICS in \\ndecreasing the risk of asthma was explored in the Preventing \\nEarly Asthma in Kids (PEAK) study.41 In the PEAK study, \\npreschool children at high risk of asthma (i.e., with a posi -\\ntive API score) were randomized to 2 years of a placebo \\nor inhaled fluticasone propionate, which were continued \\nthroughout any wheezing illnesses that the subjects expe -\\nrienced during the 2 years of intervention.

Unfortunately, the authors did not describe the causes \\nof the maternal febrile illnesses (e.g., whether they were \\nrespiratory illnesses). A British study conducted by Hughes \\net al.42 did examine maternal respiratory illnesses in a case-\\ncontrol study of 200 asthmatic children (ages 5–16) and 200 \\nage-matched controls: ARIs during pregnancy (derived from \\nprimary care records) were significantly associated with \\nasthma in the offspring (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.05–2.77), even \\nafter adjustment for multiple variables.42 The lack of viro -\\nlogical data is a limitation of this study, and the mechanism \\nunderlying this possible relationship remains unclear. Several \\nstudies have suggested that the neonatal immune system is \\naffected by antenatal exposures,44–46 including vaccination \\nwith I F V,47 but a direct link between maternal respiratory \\nvirus illnesses and the development of postnatal asthma has \\nyet to be established. With the advent of molecular methods \\nfor viral detection since the publication of the aforementioned \\nstudies, further research should utilize these new methods \\nto determine the relationship between antenatal respiratory \\nviral infections and the risk for subsequent asthma.\\nVIRUSES AND ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS\\nvIruses assoc Iated wIth asthMa exacerbat Ions\\nFor over 40 years, respiratory viruses have been associated \\nwith asthma exacerbations.1,3,4 With the advent of molecular \\ntechniques to identify viruses, viruses have been detected in \\napproximately 80%–85% of wheezing episodes in school-age \\nchildren, and in approximately 50%–75% of acute wheezing \\nepisodes in adults. HRV is the most frequent virus isolated \\nin acute exacerbations of asthma, but IFV and RSV are \\nalso important pathogens. HRV infections can occur year-\\nround but are most common in the spring and fall, whereas \\nRSV, IFV, and hMPV are typically limited to the winter and \\nearly spring months. RSV-associated wheezing is especially important in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis, as well \\nas in adults over age 65. RSV may account for up to 7% of \\nhospitalizations for asthma in adults over age 65.48 hMPV has \\nbeen associated with wheezing in young children, although \\nits role in asthma exacerbations in older patients remains \\nunclear. AdVs seem to play a minor role in asthma exacer -\\nbations overall, but they can be associated with near-fatal \\nasthma. HCoVs appear to have a minor, if any, contribution to \\nasthma exacerbations. The role of HBoVs, PyVs, and entero -\\nviruses (other than HRV) remains unclear.1,3,4\\nMechan IsMs by whIch vIruses May exacerbate  asthMa\\nPatients with asthma are not at greater risk of ARIs, having \\nthe same frequency of illnesses as people without asthma. \\nHowever, when asthmatic individuals get colds, they experi -\\nence more severe and prolonged lower respiratory tract symp -\\ntoms and greater reductions in lung function compared with \\nnonasthmatics.4,49 The mechanisms underlying this discrep -\\nancy remain poorly understood, but ex vivo experiments sug -\\ngest that HRV replicates more efficiently in asthmatic bronchial \\nepithelial cells (BECs) than in BECs from controls,50 although \\nthis is not a consistent finding.35,51 As previously mentioned, \\nasthmatic individuals may be deficient in their IFN responses \\n(IFN- α, IFN- β, IFN- λ, and IFN- γ) upon viral infection.4,32,50\\nvIrus–atopy and vIrus–bacter Ia Interact Ions\\nA growing body of evidence suggests that respiratory viruses \\ninteract with atopic responses in asthma exacerbations. \\nSensitization and exposure to high levels of the relevant aller -\\ngen increase the risk of exacerbations when atopic asthmat -\\nics develop rhinovirus infections.52–54 Attempts to simulate \\nthis interaction by challenging asthmatic individuals with \\nallergens before rhinovirus inoculation have failed to support \\nthis epidemiological observation,55,56 indicating that virus–\\nallergen interactions are complex.\\nIn contrast to virus–atopy interactions, the observation \\nthat respiratory tract viral infections often precede bacterial \\ninfections is well described. Recent evidence is now starting \\nto delineate the mechanisms that may underlie this relation -\\nship. Oliver et al.57 found that viruses impaired human alveo -\\nlar macrophage secretion of IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor \\n(TNF) after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and lipotei -\\nchoic acid, two common components of bacteria. IL-8 is key \\nto neutrophil chemotaxis and activation in the setting of an \\ninfection, and TNF has many proinflammatory effects that \\nupregulate the host immune response.58,59 In these experi -\\nments, a decreased secretion of IL-8 and TNF was indepen -\\ndent of IL-10, prostaglandin E2, and TLR2,57 but the exact \\nmechanism remains unclear. This virus-induced impairment \\nin the antibacterial host defense may facilitate bacterial super -\\ninfection during a viral respiratory illness. Because of the \\nincreased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease in asthmatic \\npatients, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization \\nPractices (ACIP) has advised pneumococcal vaccination for \\nall asthmatic patients aged 19 years and older.60', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 106}),\n"," Document(page_content='89 Viral Infections in Asthma\\nTHERAPIES THAT MAY DECREASE \\nRISK OF ASTHMA EXACERBATION \\nDUE TO RESPIRATORY VIRUSES\\nvaccInatIon\\nIFV vaccination (including vaccination against pandemic \\nH1N1 IFV) for asthma patients is strongly recommended, \\nand several studies (though not all) suggest that IFV vaccina -\\ntion reduces asthma exacerbations.61 Currently, no effective \\nvaccine exists for HRV infection, the most common cause \\nof asthma exacerbations, due to the antigenic diversity of \\napproximately 200 rhinovirus strains.\\nantIvIral agents\\nAntiviral agents such as oseltamivir can reduce asthma exac -\\nerbations precipitated by IFV.62 New antiviral agents for rhi -\\nnovirus infections are being developed and tested for their \\nability to reduce the risk for rhinovirus-induced asthma exac -\\nerbations (see later).\\ncurrently  avaIlable asthMa controller  therap Ies\\nICS has been shown to decrease virus-induced asthma \\nexacerbations in children, and in adults with intermittent or \\npersistent asthma.

Other data suggest that the combination of \\nICS with LABA synergistically suppresses BEC secretion of \\nrhinovirus-induced chemokines. Leukotriene receptor antag -\\nonists such as montelukast may also reduce asthma exacerba -\\ntions in patients with mild asthma.4\\nMabs\\nSeveral mAbs have been studied in asthma, but specific \\ninformation about respiratory viruses is largely unavailable \\nin these studies. Omalizumab (mAb against immunoglobu -\\nlin E [IgE], the key immunoglobulin involved in atopic and \\nTh2 immune responses) decreases the rate of asthma exacer -\\nbations in adults and children compared with ICS alone. In \\naddition to mAb anti-IgE, mAbs targeting other molecules \\nin the Th2 inflammatory pathway have been investigated in \\nclinical trials of asthmatic individuals, including mAbs anti -\\ncytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13; soluble receptor blockers for \\nIL-4 showed potential to decrease asthma exacerbations, but \\nlarger studies did not confirm the initial results. Mepolizumab \\n(mAb against IL-5) decreased asthma exacerbations in a study \\ninvolving severe steroid-refractory asthmatics with sputum \\neosinophilia. Studies are ongoing to confirm its effectiveness in severe asthmatics with sputum eosinophilia. Similarly, \\nlebrikizumab (mAb against IL-13) reduced asthma exacer -\\nbations in a “Th2-high” subgroup, characterized by elevated \\nlevels of periostin (an IL-13-induced protein). In contrast, \\ngolimumab (mAb against the proinflammatory cytokine \\nTNF) showed no benefit in asthma exacerbations, and the \\nstudy was stopped early due to adverse side effects, including \\nconcerns for an increased occurrence of malignancies. While \\nlittle information is available regarding the identification of \\nrespiratory viruses in these studies, the efficacy of these \\nmAbs in preventing virus-induced asthma exacerbations can \\nbe inferred from previous observations that the majority of \\nasthma exacerbations appear to be associated with viruses.4\\nMacrol Ides\\nMacrolides are known to have immunomodulatory effects \\nin addition to antimicrobial properties. Mechanistic studies \\nusing airway epithelial cell cultures have shown that mac -\\nrolides attenuate rhinovirus-induced epithelial inflammatory \\nresponses.

The factors that \\ndetermine virus-induced wheezing and asthma inception \\nafter a respiratory virus infection remain under active inves -\\ntigation, but research suggests that individual differences in \\ninnate immunity, antiviral IFN response, the degree of Th2 \\n(“allergic”) inflammation, allergen exposure, and airway \\nremodeling and repair are all factors that contribute to the \\ndevelopment of virus-induced wheezing and asthma in this \\npatient and not other children.\\nThis child’s risk of developing asthma can be predicted \\nusing the API (see Table 9.2). The patient’s parental history of \\nphysician-diagnosed asthma is one of the major criteria of the \\nAPI. Because this patient had recurrent wheezing and he meets \\na major criterion of the API, he has a positive API score.

She initially presented with multiple episodes of \\nwheezing associated with viral upper respiratory infections \\nin infancy. Around school age, she began to have more per -\\nsistent symptoms of wheezing, which necessitated frequent \\nalbuterol use, and she was placed on a daily maintenance \\ntreatment with inhaled corticosteroid treatments. Despite \\nthe addition of a controller medication, she continued to \\nhave difficulty with asthma exacerbations, especially during \\nthe winter and spring months. She was referred to an aller -\\ngist for further evaluation. A further history was elicited, \\nwhich included a clear nasal discharge present on most days \\nand the development of itchy red eyes and frequent sneez -\\ning while at her grandmother’s home, which has two cats. \\nShe had tried over-the-counter antihistamine therapy for \\nthese symptoms with limited results. There was no history \\nof food allergies, but she did have eczema as an infant. An \\nenvironmental history revealed the presence of mice and \\ncockroaches in the home.\\nA physical examination showed injected conjunctivae \\nand the presence of Denny’s lines. The nasal turbinates were \\nedematous, pale, and boggy with clear rhinorrhea. There \\nwas a “cobblestone” appearance of her posterior pharynx. \\nHer lungs were clear bilaterally with good aeration. A car -\\ndiac and abdominal examination was unremarkable. Her \\nskin was significant for scattered eczematous patches along \\nthe flexural areas of her upper and lower extremities.\\nKiara underwent skin prick testing to an inhalant environ -\\nmental allergen panel including common indoor and outdoor \\nallergens with positive histamine and negative saline con -\\ntrols. The testing revealed sensitization to dust mites, cats, \\nmice, and cockroaches, along with multiple tree and grass \\npollens. The testing was negative to dogs, weeds, and molds.Appropriate allergen avoidance and integrative pest \\nmanagement (IPM) strategies were discussed with Kiara’s \\nfamily. She was started on a leukotriene antagonist, a long-\\nacting daily antihistamine, and a steroid nasal spray. The \\npossibility of allergen immunotherapy was also discussed \\nwith her family.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAsthma is a heterogeneous disease that is influenced by \\nmultiple factors including the environment, genetics, pollu -\\ntion, infection, and diet. Atopy, defined as a predisposition to \\ndeveloping allergic sensitization, is a strong predisposing fac -\\ntor for the development of asthma, and for over two decades, \\nthere has been increasing evidence that specific allergens \\ncan have a causative role in the development of asthma.1,2 \\nEnvironmental allergen sensitivity can also play an important \\nrole in the severity and treatment of asthma. The percentage \\nof patients with asthma sensitized to ≥1 environmental aller -\\ngen approaches 80%, and atopy may be the causative fac -\\ntor in over 50% of asthma cases.3 An increased exposure to \\nallergens in sensitized individuals can lead to more asthma \\nmorbidity and increased health-care utilization.4–6 While \\nmany allergens are found indoors, the primary aeroallergens \\nto which asthmatics are sensitized include house-dust mites, \\ncats, dogs, mice, cockroaches, and mold (Table 10.1).

Within several hours, a late-\\nphase reaction occurs, which is characterized by the release \\nof leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and cluster of differentiation \\n4 (CD4+) type 2 helper T cell cytokines, such as interleukin \\n(IL)-3, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. IL-4 is the major stimulus for IgE \\nproduction, whereas IL-5 promotes the recruitment of eosino -\\nphils. An inflammatory mediator release causes increased \\nvascular permeability, bronchial smooth muscle contraction, \\nmucous secretion, and connective tissue matrix remodeling. \\nThe end result is chronic inflammation of the airways.\\nhouse-dust MIte\\nHouse-dust mites are microscopic arachnids that thrive in \\nthe indoor environment and are prevalent in warm, humid \\nhome environments. They are commonly found in bedding \\n(mattresses and pillows) and other products with woven or \\nstuffed material, including stuffed animals. The most com -\\nmon species are Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus  and D. \\nfarinae.  Of the six major groups of dust mite allergens, the \\nprimary allergens are Der p 1 and Der f 1. Proteases found in \\nthe dust mite’s gut and fecal particles are potent inducers of \\nallergic disease.\\nThe association between house-dust mite allergy and \\nasthma has been well characterized.1,6 In 1921, Kern first \\nreported positive skin testing to house-dust mites in asthmat -\\nics using dust from patients’ homes.7 House-dust mite sensi -\\ntization is present in over 50% of asthmatics and is a known \\nrisk factor for the development of childhood asthma.8 A study \\nby Sporik et al. showed that the relative risk of developing \\nasthma was approximately five times greater in subjects with \\nhigh levels of dust mite allergen exposure ( >10 μg/g).2 A more \\nrecent study by Celedon et al. demonstrated that early expo -\\nsure to house-dust mites was associated with an increased \\nrisk of asthma and late-onset wheezing.9\\nThere are several approaches to house-dust mite remedia -\\ntion (Table 10.2), and experts agree that a comprehensive strat -\\negy is best. This would include the use of dust mite encasings \\nfor mattresses and pillows,10 washing linens weekly in hot \\nwater greater than 130 °F, the removal of carpeting especially in the bedroom, keeping humidity levels in the home to less \\nthan 50%, and using a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) \\nfilter vacuum on a weekly basis. Platts-Mills et al. looked at \\nthe long-term effects of avoiding house-dust mite allergens in \\nnine asthmatics.11 Clinical symptoms and morning peak flow \\nmeasurements improved in all subjects, and five subjects tol -\\nerated significant increases in the concentration of histamine \\nnecessary to provoke a 30% fall in forced expiratory volume \\nin 1 s (FEV1).\\ncat and dog\\nDomestic animal allergies are common in people with \\nasthma. The primary cat allergen is Fel d 1, which is found \\nin saliva, dander, and hair, and is produced in the sebaceous, \\nsalivary, and anal glands. The cat allergen can take several \\nmonths to degrade once the primary source is removed from \\nan indoor environment, and this allergen has been found in \\ndust samples taken from environments without cat exposure, \\nincluding schools and day cares.12,13 The major dog allergen \\nis Can f 1, which is also found in hair, saliva, and dander. \\nBoth cat and dog allergens consist of small particles that are \\ncapable of rapid dispersal in the air.TABLE 10.1\\nIndoor Allergen Classification\\nCommon \\nName Taxonomic NameMajor \\nAllergen(s)Molecular \\nWeight (kD)\\nHouse-dust \\nmiteDermatophagoides \\npteronyssinus  and \\nD.\\xa0farinaDer p 1, Der f \\n124, 27\\nCat Felis domesticus Fel d 1 17\\nDog Canis familiaris Can f 1, 2 23, 19\\nCockroach Blatella germanica  and \\nPeriplaneta americanaBla g 1, Bla g \\n2, Per a 146, 36, 45\\nMouse Mus musculus Mus m 1, 2 19,16TABLE 10.2\\nDust Mite Allergen Avoidance and Patient Education\\nBasic Education Principles\\n• Assess home environment.\\n• Provide a general description of mites (including sources of food; human \\nskin scales).\\n• Avoid conditions for optimal dust mite growth (keep humidity <50%).\\n• Identify local areas of dust mite growth (pillows, mattresses, box springs, \\ncarpet, upholstered furniture, draperies, stuffed animals).\\nPriorities for Mite/Allergen Avoidance\\nBedroom\\n• Encase pillows ( <10 μm pore fine-woven or vapor-permeable cover).\\n• Encase mattress in vapor-permeable or plastic cover.\\n• Encase box spring in vinyl or plastic.\\n• Wash bedding weekly in hot water ( >130°F).\\nFloor\\n• Vacuum weekly (wear mask; leave room for 20 min after cleaning).\\n• Ensure vacuum cleaner has good-quality bags (double thickness) and/or \\nhigh efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter on air outlet.\\n• Clean smooth floors by vacuuming plus damp mopping.\\n• Loose rugs may be washed intermittently to remove allergens.\\nFurnishings\\n• If possible, replace with cleanable items that do not retain dust.\\n• Possible compromise may be regularly washing loose covers of \\ntight-weave cloth.\\nLong-Term Changes\\n• Reduce indoor relative humidity (air conditioning [A/C], dehumidifier, \\nopen windows).\\n• Replace carpets with polished flooring (wood, vinyl, tile) if possible.\\n• Replace upholstered furniture with leather, vinyl, or wood.\\n• Replace draperies with shades or blinds that can be wiped down.\\n• Avoid living in basements.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 112}),\n"," Document(page_content='95 Asthma and Allergens\\nThe role of pet allergen exposure and sensitization is \\nunclear, as there is controversy over whether early, frequent \\nexposure to pets will lead to sensitization or induce tolerance. \\nSeveral recent studies suggest protective effects in reducing \\nallergic sensitization in infants exposed to pet allergens.14–16 \\nIngram et al., however, reported a strong correlation between \\nasthma and children sensitized and exposed to increased \\nlevels of cat and dog allergens.17 Overall, there is a general \\nagreement that cat and dog allergens in sensitized asthmatic \\nindividuals can be problematic. Cat allergen exposure in \\nsensitized individuals is also associated with decreased lung \\nfunction in young children.18\\nThe avoidance measures for pet allergens are summarized \\nin Table 10.3. While the best way to eliminate a pet allergen \\nis to remove the pet from the home, this is often difficult for \\nfamilies. If the pet remains, it is generally recommended to \\nremove the pet from the bedroom and confine it to one area \\nof the home as much as possible. Other effective strategies \\ninclude the removal of all carpeting, the use of allergen-proof \\nencasings for mattresses and pillows, and the use of HEPA \\nfilters and HEPA filter vacuums.\\ncocKroach\\nThe primary indoor species of cockroach are Blattella ger -\\nmanica  (German cockroach) and Periplaneta americana  \\n(American cockroach). The major allergens are Bla g 1, Bla \\ng 2, and Per a 1, which are found in fecal material, saliva, \\nsecretions, and debris. A cockroach infestation is associated \\nwith an urban, inner-city environment, a high population \\ndensity, and a low socioeconomic status.Rosenstreich et al. investigated home cockroach aller -\\ngen exposure and asthma morbidity in urban home envi -\\nronments in inner-city children.19 This study utilized the \\nNational Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study (NCICAS), \\na cohort of 1528 children with asthma from 8 major inner-\\ncity areas in the United States. It was demonstrated that \\nchildren who were sensitized to cockroaches and had evi -\\ndence of elevated cockroach antigen levels in their homes \\nhad increased asthma morbidity. Specifically, children with \\nasthma who were sensitized to cockroaches and had high \\ncockroach allergen exposure levels in their homes had signif -\\nicantly higher rates of asthma-related hospitalization, more \\nunscheduled medical visits per year, more days of wheez -\\ning, more school absences, more nights with lost sleep, and \\nmore disruption of their caregiver’s plans. Rosenstreich’s \\nstudy highlighted the importance of the cockroach aller -\\ngen as a unique and modifiable inner-city exposure, and \\nled to further research focusing on cockroaches and other \\nurban allergen exposures and their effects on asthma.20,21 \\nExposure to the cockroach allergen in the home has also \\nbeen associated with incident doctor-diagnosed asthma and \\nrecurrent wheezing.22\\nThe cockroach allergen is also prevalent in schools. Over \\n66% of collected dust samples from urban Baltimore elemen -\\ntary schools had detectable levels of the cockroach allergen.13 \\nA similar study found detectable levels in 77% of 11 urban \\nhigh schools in the northeastern United States.23 Research is \\nongoing regarding the association of the cockroach allergen \\nand asthma morbidity in the school setting.\\nControlling a cockroach infestation is best accomplished \\nwith a comprehensive approach. This would include the use \\nof insecticides, pesticides, and bait traps, along with seal -\\ning holes and cracks in the home. Eggleston et al. demon -\\nstrated a 51% reduction in the cockroach allergen by using \\neducation, extermination, HEPA filters, and bed encasings.24 \\nCockroach management and control strategies are summa -\\nrized in Table\\xa010.4.TABLE 10.3\\nAvoidance Measures for Pet Allergens\\nBasic Principles\\n• Emphasis is on control using allergy-proof encasings, furnishings \\n(cleanable), carpets (removal/cleanable surfaces), and clothing (change \\nif contaminated, wash regularly).\\n• Low confidence on methods that rely on chemicals.\\n• Focus on air filtration as a pet allergen is airborne for prolonged periods \\nof time.\\nControl of Source\\n• Encourage the eviction of the animal, particularly where clinical effects \\nare obvious and sensitization is present.\\n• If not possible, families can limit the animal’s territory to indoor \\ncleanable areas (kitchen) and confine it to the outdoors at other times.\\n• Note that an allergen is very persistent and can last many months, and \\nits control may require aggressive cleaning and the removal of heavily \\ncontaminated items.\\nAdditional Comments\\n• Measures may be required to prevent the significant transport of an \\nallergen to houses without pets from houses with furred pets and from \\npublic buildings.\\n• Production varies widely between animals and over time, it is not well \\nunderstood, and it is unlikely that truly allergen-free breeds of cats or \\ndogs exist.TABLE 10.4\\nCockroach Management and Control Procedures\\n• Perform a careful inspection to detect insect hiding places and travel \\nroutes, and to identify food sources (grease, cooking debris).\\n• Remove sources of food and household food wastes (do not keep garbage \\ncans inside, avoid exposed pet food and snack food containers).\\n• Remove or repair leaking faucets or condensation on pipes.\\n• Before applying an insecticide, perform a good general cleaning so that \\nthe insects are more likely to eat the gels or baits.\\n• Apply insecticides using gels or baits, in selected areas. In the kitchen, \\napply gel spots to cracks, crevices, the junctures of cupboards or walls \\nwith floors, and counters. Bait traps are just as effective as gel baits if \\nthey are used properly.\\n• Perform a section treatment after 1 or 2 weeks.\\n• After 1 week following the application of an insecticide, perform a \\nthorough house cleaning, removing grease and other food debris.\\n• Wash bedding, curtains, and clothing.\\n• Consider the same principles for rodent or other pest management.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 113}),\n"," Document(page_content='96 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nMouse\\nThe major mouse allergens include mus m 1 and mus m 2, \\nwhich are found in mouse urine, dander, and hair follicles. \\nSimilar to cockroaches, mouse infestations are more preva -\\nlent in urban, high population density environments, as well \\nas high-rise apartments and homes with physical damage.\\nStudies by Phipatanakul and Matsui have highlighted the \\nrelationship between the mouse allergen and asthma.25–28 \\nPhipatanakul demonstrated detectable mouse allergen levels \\nin 95% of homes in 499 subjects from the NCICAS, and also \\ndemonstrated that high mouse allergen levels can lead to sen -\\nsitization. Homes with higher mouse allergen levels in this \\nstudy had significantly higher rates of mouse sensitization.28 \\nIn the Boston Home Allergens and Asthma Study, which \\nincluded 500 infants of atopic parents, a significant associa -\\ntion was seen between current mouse exposure and current \\nwheeze through age 7. Early mouse exposure in infancy was \\npredictive of atopy, but did not predict the presence of asthma \\nor wheeze at age 7.26 Matsui found that in mouse-sensitized, \\ninner-city children, exposure to the mouse allergen may be \\nan important cause of asthma morbidity.27\\npollen  and Mold\\nDetailed descriptions of the complexities involved in pol -\\nlen and mold species are beyond the scope of this chap -\\nter. However, pollen and mold spore exposures can trigger \\nasthma exacerbations or worsen the symptoms in sensitized \\nindividuals. Pollen’s role in nature is to transport the male \\ngamete (i.e., DNA) to the female part of a flower through \\nwind or insect dispersal. In most parts of the United States, \\ntrees pollinate in the spring, grass pollinates from late spring \\nto early summer, and weeds pollinate in late summer through \\nfall. In tropical climates, these seasons can be longer.\\nTrees are either seed bearing (gymnosperms) or flowering \\n(angiosperms), and most allergenic trees are in the flowering \\ngroup.29 Birch, oak, elm, and maple trees are common in the \\nnortheast and less prevalent in the southwest.30 A single birch \\ntree flower cluster can produce 6 million pollen grains. Tree \\npollens range in size from 20 to 50 μm.\\nRagweed pollen is released in the morning and peaks by \\nnoon.31 A single ragweed plant can expel a million pollen \\ngrains in a day. Species such as ragweed, lamb’s quarter, and \\nplantain are found throughout the United States. Weed pol -\\nlens range in size from 10 to 20 μm.\\nGrass pollen is a common cause of springtime allergies. \\nIt is a larger pollen around 50 μm in size. Northern grasses \\nin the United States include timothy, orchard, meadow, rye, \\nKentucky, redtop, and vernal, while southern grasses include \\nBermuda, Bahia, and Johnson.\\nFungal spores are responsible for both seasonal and \\nperennial allergy symptoms. Outdoor spores peak in mid-\\nsummer and diminish with the first hard frost in regions \\nthat experience cold winter seasons. Dry-air spores, includ -\\ning Alternaria , Cladosporium , and Epicoccum , peak in the \\nafternoon hours under low humidity. Wet-air spores peak during the predawn hours with high humidity and include \\nascospores and basidiospores (mushrooms, puffballs). \\nAlternaria  is the most prevalent mold in dry, warm climates. \\nIt is commonly found in soil, seeds, and plants. Several stud -\\nies have shown associations between Alternaria  and severe \\nasthma.32–35 Cladosporium  is the most prevalent spore in \\ntemperate regions and is the most commonly identified out -\\ndoor fungus. It is found on dead plants or vegetable matter. \\nAspergillus  is often isolated from house dust. It is also found \\nin compost heaps and dead vegetation. Penicillium  is found \\nin soil, food and grains, and house dust. It grows in water-\\ndamaged buildings, wallpaper, and decaying fabrics, giving \\na green “mildew” color. All of these molds induce allergic \\nrhinitis, asthma, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\\nPollen and fungal spore counts are collected the previous \\nday and then counted; therefore, the reports that we see on \\ntelevision or on websites are a day late. The National Allergy \\nBureau (NAB) is part of the American Academy of Allergy, \\nAsthma, and Immunology and it supplies the public with esti -\\nmates of pollen and spore counts (www.aaaai.org/nab). The \\nmost common type of sampling devices is volumetric sam -\\nplers that draw pollens and mold spores from the air. Studies \\nhave shown that there is a variation in pollen counts even \\nbetween locations in the same city.36,37 Therefore, one pollen \\ncount may not represent the entire city, but the information \\ndoes inform people when their pollen season begins and pol -\\nlen counts roughly correlate with the severity of symptoms.\\nIntact pollens range from 10 to 100 μm, though most have \\ndiameters between 20 and 35 μm, while fungal spores range \\nfrom 2 to 50 μm.38 These large particles are removed by the \\nnasal mucosa and upper tracheobroncial passages. However, \\nparticles <5 μm generally reach the alveoli of the lungs.39 \\nAn intact pollen is too large to reach the alveoli, but stud -\\nies have shown that submicronic pollen-derived bioaerosols \\ncan reach the alveoli. For example, ryegrass pollen ruptures \\non contact with water and releases microscopic starch par -\\nticles (0.5–2.5  μm) containing a major grass allergen. Such \\nbioaerosols have been shown to be expulsed from pollens and \\nmold spores.40–43 While rain can wash pollen grains or spores \\nfrom the air, the expulsed bioaerosols can trigger asthma \\nexacerbations. Bioaerosols are thought to be associated \\nwith thunderstorm asthma epidemics.39,40–43 In Melbourne, \\nin 1987, there was a fivefold increase in asthma emergency \\ndepartment (ED) visits in a 24-h period after a thunderstorm. \\nIn 1989, there was a tenfold increase with 277 ED visits.39,44 \\nIn 1994, in London, 40 patients presented with asthma flares \\nwithin 24 h of a storm.45,46\\nA number of studies describe morbidity secondary to fun -\\ngal exposure. Alternaria  sensitivity has been found to be a \\nrisk factor for severe asthma attacks and epidemic asthma.32,33 \\nTargonski et al. demonstrated that Chicago asthma deaths \\nwere more than two times higher on days when there were \\n1000 spores per cubic meter.34 Dales et al. studied the associa -\\ntion between daily ED visits for asthma to a children’s hospital \\nand concentrations of pollen grains and fungal spores during \\na 5-year period.47 The authors found that the concentration \\nof fungal spores and not grass pollen significantly correlated ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 114}),\n"," Document(page_content='97 Asthma and Allergens\\nwith ED visits. Sears et al. reported similar findings in a group \\nof New Zealand children followed from birth to 13 years of \\nage. The most common allergen sensitization was grass; how -\\never, a relative risk analysis demonstrated that sensitivity to \\nhouse-dust mites, cats, dogs, and indoor mold was a highly \\nsignificant risk factor associated with current asthma whereas \\nsensitivity to grass was not a significant risk factor.35\\nStrategies for mold management are listed in Table 10.5 \\nand include reducing humidity levels to less than 50% and \\npromptly repairing leaks. It is not possible to control the pol -\\nlen or mold spore level outside the home, but one can control \\nthe amount of allergen that gets inside the house. Two major \\ncomponents of control are keeping windows and doors closed \\nduring high counts and bathing to remove allergens in the \\nhair and on the body (Table 10.4). HEPA filters can reduce \\npollen in the home.48 Sensitized individuals with allergen-\\ninduced asthma can benefit from immunotherapy. A number \\nof trials have shown that immunotherapy is beneficial in treat -\\ning allergen-induced asthma.49–54 Abramson et al. conducted \\na meta-analysis for the Cochrane Database of 20 published \\nprospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of immu -\\nnotherapy for asthma between 1960 and 1990, and concluded \\nthat immunotherapy reduces asthma symptoms and the use of \\nasthma medications, and improves bronchial hyperreactivity.50\\nCURRENT AND FUTURE RESEARCH\\nWhile continuing to examine the role of indoor allergens in \\nthe home environment, research has recently been expanded \\nto examine the role of indoor allergen exposure in other com -\\nmonly encountered childhood environments such as schools \\nand day-care centers.55 Sheehan et al. found detectable levels \\nof the mouse allergen in 89% of dust samples obtained from \\ninner-city schools.56 Permaul et al. recently investigated aller -\\ngens in inner-city schools.57 Over 400 airborne and settled \\ndust samples from 12 inner-city schools were compared with \\n118 samples from the homes of asthmatic children attending \\nthese schools. The results showed substantial mouse allergen \\nlevels as well as increased levels of dog and cat allergens in \\nthe schools compared with the homes. The study concluded \\nthat mouse allergens in inner-city school classrooms may be \\na significant source of exposure for students.\\nThe identification of urban allergen exposures such as \\ncockroaches and mice, and their associations with aller -\\ngen sensitization and asthma morbidity led to intervention \\nstrategies termed integrative pest management . This com -\\nprehensive approach involves education, extermination, maintaining proper food storage, use of air filters, and seal -\\ning of holes and cracks in the home. IPM has been shown \\nto significantly reduce mouse allergen levels in the homes \\nof asthmatic children with mouse sensitization.58 Ongoing \\nstudies are attempting to understand the role of interventions \\nto reduce urban allergen exposures in homes and asthma \\nmorbidity. Furthermore, an understanding of allergen expo -\\nsures, including mice59–61 and mold,62 in urban environ -\\nments outside of the home, such as schools, is ongoing, and \\nmay prove to be important targets for effective and efficient \\nintervention strategies to reduce allergenic triggers.\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn atopic individuals, environmental allergens can play a sig -\\nnificant role in asthma development and asthma morbidity. \\nPatients with asthma, as in our patient case, can benefit from \\nskin testing to identify common environmental inhalant aller -\\ngens. Once the culprit allergens are identified in susceptible \\npatients, the focus should shift to appropriate environmental \\nremediation strategies, including education, avoidance, car -\\npet removal, allergy-proof encasings, air filtration, HEPA \\nfilter vacuums, and IPM. The ongoing primary prevention \\ntrials are needed to determine whether the early reduction of \\nindoor allergen exposures will decrease the risk of asthma \\ndevelopment.\\nREFERENCES\\n 1.

She had long enjoyed bicycle \\ncommuting to work, and recalled the calming effect of her \\nrides along a flat and quiet bike path to the small college \\ncampus of her former employment. Her new bicycle route \\nto work would logically take her through streets with the \\nmost prominent vehicular traffic, in order to pursue the \\nmost direct path to her office. Within weeks of settling into \\nher new environment, she noted wheezing toward the end \\nof her 30-min ride to the university. She had asthma as a \\nchild but had been asymptomatic since her teenage years. \\nHer new physician recommended that she obtain peak \\nflow readings throughout both her commuting workdays \\nand weekend days (during which she did not exercise). She \\nrecorded such readings four times daily for 4 weeks dur -\\ning April and demonstrated that peak flows were gener -\\nally above 500 L/sec throughout the weekend days and in \\nthe mornings of workdays, but they dropped intermittently \\nbelow 400 L/sec at the midmorning and early afternoon \\nweekday readings. The midmorning reading was performed \\nshortly after her arrival at work, at the end of her bicycle \\ncommute but before she entered her office. The lowest read -\\nings were associated with wheezing but were unassociated \\nwith the daily temperature or humidity. However, the over -\\nall pattern (lower average readings on workdays with her \\nbike commute than on weekends when she generally stayed \\nat home) became more obvious and severe toward the end of \\nthe month of data gathering.\\nWith this information, her physician suspected that traf -\\nfic-related air pollution was exacerbating her asthma, previ -\\nously quiescent during her recent decades in a small, rural \\nacademic community. He further suspected that she had an allergy to trees that had not been prominent in her last com -\\nmunity and that these tree allergens were interacting with \\nthe traffic-related particulate matter (PM) to augment the \\nadverse effect on her asthma.\\nA referral to an allergist who tested her to aeroallergens \\nrevealed that she was sensitized to birch pollen by skin prick \\ntesting. The professor’s bicycling route was analyzed in \\nterms of the proportion of time that she spent on or within \\n300 m of major roadways (with four lines of traffic) and it \\nwas noted that 70% of her commute was in such proximity to \\nhigh-traffic byways.\\nOn advice from her physician, the professor was able to \\nmap out an alternate route by which only 15% of her time \\nwas within 300 m of a major roadway, and after a trial she \\nnoted that the duration of her commute increased by only \\n4 min in each direction. Following this new route over the \\nnext month, the frequency of her wheezing and peak flow \\nreadings below 400 L/min decreased dramatically.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAsthma is a disease characterized by intermittent broncho -\\nconstriction due to increased airway responsiveness to both \\nallergic and nonallergic stimuli. Airways inflammation is \\na key underlying feature of this disease. Epidemiological \\nevidence from the last two decades has shown that envi -\\nronmental pollutants such as ozone, PM, diesel exhaust \\n(DE), and biological/microbial agents contribute signifi -\\ncantly to the morbidity associated with asthma, includ -\\ning increasing exacerbation frequency.1–4 More recently, \\nsome pollutants, such as ozone, are now being implicated \\nas causal agents in the development of new-onset asthma. \\nOf note, the association between asthma exacerbation and 11Air Pollutants\\nNeil E.

Moreover, studies \\nhave now focused on certain exposure locations, such as \\nliving near busy roadways or high traffic areas, as places \\nof particularly high risk to suffer the deleterious effects of \\nair pollution.5 As noted in the preceding case study, daily \\n(Monday to Friday) exercise (bicycling) exposure near a \\nbusy urban roadway in combination with exposure to high \\nlevels of a specific allergen (birch pollen), was the likely \\ncause of enhanced asthma exacerbations in a patient who, \\nprior to this routine exposure, was symptomatically quies -\\ncent. Furthermore, in the absence of this exposure routine \\non weekends, her frequency of symptoms was significantly \\nreduced. This case study draws our attention to the fact that \\nair pollution may be affecting the airway’s host defense \\ncapability to allergens or equally feasible, and according to \\nrecent evidence,6 it may even augment exposure to airborne \\nallergens.\\nThe public health concern regarding the effect of air pol -\\nlution on asthma is valid. It is estimated that over 120 mil -\\nlion people in the United States live in areas that are not in \\ncompliance with current air pollutant standards. Therefore, \\npoor air quality in many places remains a significant problem \\nfor patients with asthma. This chapter will review our cur -\\nrent understanding of asthma and air pollution by examining \\nrecent findings in the context of association-based evidence \\nprovided by epidemiological and cohort studies, as well as \\neffects-based evidence generated from controlled chamber \\nstudies.\\nMODIFYING FACTORS\\nAt the outset, it is prudent to recognize that a myriad of fac -\\ntors must be considered when discussing the impact of air \\npollution on asthma. These factors can all contribute to the \\nheterogeneity in the results often observed when examining \\nthis complex area. These factors are typically related to: (a) \\nsubject phenotype such as age (childhood vs. adult asthma), \\nrace, gender, body mass index (BMI), and asthma inflamma -\\ntory phenotype and genotype; (b) differences in study design \\nand analysis techniques, that is, the proximity to exposure \\nversus the estimation of exposure by using land-use regres -\\nsion modeling; (c) implementation of different exposure \\nmatrices; and (d) use of a range of methods to measure clini -\\ncal and biological outcomes. For example, studying asthma \\nexacerbation in existing asthmatics is quite different from \\nassessing whether a pollutant is causing new-onset asthma. \\nLikewise, the measurement and sampling techniques for \\ninflammatory biomarkers in patients are not necessar -\\nily interchangeable or comparable; for example, the use of \\ninduced sputum examines cellular and biochemical mark -\\ners of inflammation on the surfaces of the central airways7 \\ncompared with bronchoalveolar lavage, which reflects events \\nin the more distal airways. Therefore, caution must be used \\nwhen making direct study comparisons or including studies \\nin meta-analyses where different measurement and analysis \\nmethodologies have been used.AIR POLLUTION AND ASTHMA EXACERBATION\\nIt is widely accepted that air pollution can exacerbate asthma \\nin those individuals who already have the condition. Many \\nstudies from the past several years have reported significant \\nassociations between exposure to air pollution (ozone, PM, die -\\nsel exhaust particles [DEPs], mold/fungal spores) and asthma \\nexacerbations, and in the case of certain pollutants such as \\nozone, a lag time of 1–2 days following exposure is correlated \\nwith increased admissions to emergency departments (ED) for \\nrespiratory complaints.8–13 Recent studies continue to support \\nthe association between air pollution and asthma. For example, \\nGlad et al.14 examined ED visits for asthma (a specific metric \\nfor asthma exacerbation) over a period of 3 years (2003–2005) \\nin 6979 individuals. They reported a 2.5% increase in asthma \\nED visits for each 10 ppb increase in the 1 h maximum ozone \\nlevel on day 2 after exposure, which was associated with a sig -\\nnificant odds ratio (OR = 1.025, P < .05). PM2.5 (coarse size \\nPM) also had a significant effect (OR = 1.036, P < .05) on ED \\nvisits on day 1 after exposure in the total population examined \\nand on days 1, 2, and 3 in the African American population \\nbut not the Caucasian population. These more current epide -\\nmiological data continue to support the long-held view that \\nthere is a clear association between air pollution and asthma \\nexacerbation. Several meta-analyses have been conducted on \\ncohort studies that examined specific communities living in \\nclose proximity to traffic-related pollutants in order to define \\ntheir specific impact on asthma morbidity. These studies gen -\\nerally agree that an association exists between asthma preva -\\nlence (the number of existing cases of asthma) and exposure \\nto traffic, particularly in children.15,16 A recent meta-analysis \\nof 19 studies conducted by Gasana and colleagues16 concluded \\nthat exposure to the traffic-related pollutants nitrogen dioxide \\n([NO2] meta-OR: 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0–1.1), \\nnitrous oxide (meta-OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.0–1.04), and carbon \\nmonoxide (meta-OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.0–1.02) was positively \\nassociated with a higher prevalence of childhood asthma. \\nIndeed, even more specific components of the traffic exposure \\nmatrix have begun to emerge as important. For example, Eckel \\nand colleagues17 recently reported that the length of a roadway \\nwas the only significant indicator of residential traffic-related \\npollution exposure associated with airway inflammation in \\nchildren with asthma. The relationship between asthma and air \\npollution, however, has been more difficult to establish when \\nanalyzing beyond individual communities. In other words, \\nthe relationship does not appear to hold when the analysis is \\nexpanded to the community level. For example, Anderson and \\ncolleagues,18 using satellite-based estimates of ambient air pol -\\nlution and global variations in childhood asthma prevalence, \\nreported no evidence of a positive association between air pol -\\nlution levels and childhood asthma prevalence.\\nAIR POLLUTION AND NEW-ONSET ASTHMA\\nEvidence has been emerging over the last 3–4 years that air \\npollution, specifically traffic-related air pollutants, may be \\ncontributing to new-onset asthma.

A year later, \\nJarrett et al.20 reported on a prospective cohort study in \\nchildren using personal exposure measurements (Southern \\nCalifornia Children’s Health Study). In models controlling \\nfor confounders, “incident” (new-onset) asthma was posi -\\ntively associated with traffic pollution, with a hazard ratio \\n(HR) of 1.29 (95% CI, 1.07–1.56) across the average within-\\ncommunity interquartile range of 6.2 ppb in annual residen -\\ntial NO2. McConnell21 also reported that modeled exposure \\nto nonfreeway traffic-related pollutants both at home and in \\nschool increased the risk of children developing new-onset \\nasthma. There is quite a lot of evidence (some of it method -\\nologically stronger than others) that there is a weak asso -\\nciation, particularly with exposure to traffic within cities. In \\ncontrast, when traffic within whole cities is compared, there \\nis generally no (ecological) association with asthma preva -\\nlence.22,23 Two recent reviews of meta-analyses examining \\nthe association between asthma incidence and air pollution \\nwere conducted by Gasana16 in South Florida and Gowers15 \\nin the United Kingdom. Both analyses concluded that there \\nis a positive association between the prevalence of asthma \\nsymptoms and possible asthma incidence and traffic-related \\npollutants. Specifically, the U.S. study identified the expo -\\nsure to NO2 as having a positive association with childhood \\nasthma incidence (meta-OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.06–1.24). The \\ninfluence of traffic-related pollutants (DEPs) on very early-\\nage groups was assessed in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy \\nand Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS) birth cohort. That study \\nconcluded that the proximity to stop-and-go traffic with high \\nbus and truck concentrations predicted persistent wheeze \\nduring infancy and DEP exposure was significantly associ -\\nated with wheeze at age 1 and persistent wheeze at age 3.24 \\nAn additional longitudinal follow-up of this population is \\nnecessary to confirm whether persistent wheezing in this \\npopulation represents the development of asthma. The evi -\\ndence suggests that in addition to air pollution acting as an \\nexacerbating agent, air pollutants, particularly traffic-related \\nones, may be contributing to the development of new-onset \\nasthma.\\nEpidemiological studies and cohort studies can high -\\nlight the association between disease and exposure, but \\nthey cannot assess how individual pollutants affect the \\nbiology and physiology of asthma. To address these ques -\\ntions, chamber exposure studies are used in which individ -\\nuals (asthmatic and nonasthmatics) are exposed to selected \\npollutants under carefully controlled conditions, such as \\nexposure duration, pollutant concentration, and ventilation \\nor breathing rate. Clinical and biological outcome mea -\\nsures are obtained both before and after exposure. Much \\nevidence has been acquired from these types of controlled \\nexposure studies to further our understanding of how pol -\\nlutants are exerting their effects on the biology and physi -\\nology of asthma.EFFECT OF AIR POLLUTANTS \\nON ASTHMA BIOLOGY\\nTo understand how oxidant pollutants such as ozone, or bio -\\nlogical/bacterial-based pollutants such as endotoxin affect \\nthe biology of asthma, it is important to appreciate the con -\\nstitutive state of the asthmatic airway prior to exposure in \\nterms of inflammation, immunology, and physiology. This \\nwill allow a better appreciation of how the asthmatic airway \\nis predisposed to respond to a particular air pollutant, espe -\\ncially since pollutants differ in their mechanisms of action. \\nFor example, pollutants such as ozone or PM25,26 will induce \\noxidative stress responses, whereas pollutants with biological \\ncomponents adhered to their surface, such as bacterial endo -\\ntoxin on coarse size PM (PM2.5–10) or peptidoglycan/gram-\\npositive bacteria on swine dust,27 may exert their effects \\nprimarily or initially through innate immune mechanisms. \\nIn terms of airways inflammation, there are different asthma \\nphenotypes to be recognized (eosinophilic, neutrophilic, \\npaucigranulocytic) and these differ according to the stability \\nof the disease (stable vs. acute) and whether it is present in \\nchildren or adults. For acute asthma, the eosinophilic phe -\\nnotype predominates in children (50%), while in adults, the \\nneutrophilic phenotype predominates (82%) and is negatively \\ncorrelated with lung function and airflow obstruction.28,29 For \\nstable asthma, the paucigranulocytic phenotype appears to \\nbe the most common in both children and adults. In terms of \\nmicrobial presence, it has now become clear that more severe \\nasthmatics have increased microbial colonization of the air -\\nways30,31 and, in fact, they have an increased risk of invasive \\npneumococcal disease.32,33 A recent study conducted in Sao \\nPaulo, Brazil, reported that indoor levels of NO2 and personal \\nexposure to ozone were significantly associated with the \\nprevalence of pneumonia ( P = .02) in asthmatic children.34 In \\ngeneral, asthmatic patients have increased lower respiratory \\ntract symptoms, greater impairment of their lung function, \\nand increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness. However, per -\\ntinent to how they may respond to inhaled pollutants, asth -\\nmatics have a diminished innate immune response capability \\nand depleted levels of antioxidants.35,36 Several years ago, \\nAlexis showed that sputum macrophages from eosinophilic \\nasthmatics had decreased expression of the innate immune \\ncell-surface marker cluster of differentiation 64 (CD64) and \\ndecreased phagocytic capacity (Figure 11.1a), where the lat -\\nter effect was positively correlated with markers of asthma \\nseverity (PC20,FEV1; forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] \\npercentage; eosinophils percentage) (Figure 11.1b).35\\nMore recently, Newcomb and Peebles37 showed that asth -\\nmatics have muted interferon gamma (IFN γ) and interleukin \\n(IL)-10 responses following a challenge with an experimental \\nrhinovirus infection, while Brickey38 recently reported that \\nasthmatics have decreased inflammasome gene expression, \\narguably making them more susceptible to the deleterious \\neffects of inhaled pollutants. Kongerud et al.36 also showed \\nthat asthma patients have deficient levels of the potent antiox -\\nidant ascorbic acid in their airways, thus making them more \\nsusceptible to inhaled environmental oxidants such as ozone, ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 121}),\n"," Document(page_content='104 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\n100 –20100020003000\\n–1 0\\nlog PC20,FEV1 (mg/mL)120\\n(A) (B)\\n(C)\\n(b)(a)\\n(D)Control0100020003000\\nAEo+ AEo–\\n0 05001000150020002500\\n250050007500\\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\\n050010001500200025003000\\n110 120Sputum macrophag e\\nphago cytosis (MFI )Sputum macrophage\\nphago cytosis\\nMean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI)\\nPhag ocytosis (MFI) sput um\\nmacrophage sSputum macrophage\\nphago cytosis (MFI )\\nSputum macrophage\\nphago cytosis (MFI )\\n130R = 0.8\\nP < .0001R = 0.62\\nP < .007R = –0.6\\nP < .01\\nR = 0.7\\nP < .002\\n140\\n% Pre dicte d FV CSputum eosinophils (%) 70 80 90 1001 10 1201 30 140\\n% Pr edicted FEV1*#a\\nFIGURE 11.1  (a) Sputum macrophage phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized yeast (in the presence of human serum) expressed as the mean \\nfluorescence intensity (MFI) in healthy controls, eosinophilic asthmatics (AEo +), and noneosinophilic asthmatics (AEo −).

Potentially, biomarkers \\nmay be useful in predicting which individual asthmatics \\nmay have an exaggerated inflammatory response to ozone, \\nthereby making them more susceptible to subsequently \\ninhaled allergenic stimuli. Indeed, Alexis et al.41 showed that \\nCD11b expression on circulating monocytes may be a useful \\nbiomarker, as it was found to be positively associated with \\nthe magnitude of the neutrophil response following inhaled \\nozone exposure in asthmatics. To this end, Svendsen et al.42 \\nalso reported that asthmatic children without a measurable \\nCD14 expression on circulating neutrophils had significant \\ndecrements in their lung function not observed in children \\nwith CD14 expression, which were associated with exposure \\nto ambient PM2.5 and PM2.5–10.\\nendotox In\\nAlthough perhaps not generally considered an air pollutant \\nby classic definition, endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) \\nis ubiquitous in nature, an active component of PM-induced \\nairway cell toxicity,43 and an active component of both \\nhouse dust and occupational dust.44–46 Endotoxin is a known \\nenhancing factor for asthma severity47 and can act as an adju -\\nvant for the subsequent response to inhaled allergens in the \\nnasal48 and lower airways.49 These data suggest that atopy \\nplays an important role in how endotoxin exerts its effect in \\nasthma. Indeed, significant associations have been reported \\nbetween the magnitude of the LPS-induced polymorphonu -\\nclear neutrophil (PMN) response (PMN per milligram) and \\nconstitutive levels of the LPS receptor (CD14), in both its sol -\\nuble form (sCD14) and its membrane-bound form (mCD14).50 \\nAlexis showed that baseline levels of airway eosinophils \\nwere positively correlated with sCD14 and the magnitude \\nof the PMN response to LPS, suggesting that atopy plays \\nan important role in the sensitivity of asthmatics to LPS.50 \\nMoreover, Alexis51 further showed that blunting eosinophil \\nlevels in asthmatics with a corticosteroid (fluticosone propri -\\nonate [FP]) pretreatment decreased monocytic cell mCD14 \\nexpression before and after LPS inhalation, and it decreased \\nthe magnitude of the PMN response to inhaled LPS (Figure \\n11.3a and 11.3b).\\nAlthough not the case for ozone, LPS appears to induce \\nopposite responses in asthmatics depending on whether the \\ndose is relatively high ( >30,000 EU) or quite low (10,000 EU). \\nAt high doses ( >30,000 EU), endotoxin will induce lung \\nfunction decline, symptoms such as malaise, fever, chills, \\nand neutrophil influx to the airways, as measured by an \\nincrease in the percentage of neutrophils in the sputum.52–55 \\nBut, in general, LPS appears to cause an overall reduction \\nin immunoinflammatory activity both locally in the airway \\nand systemically. Hernandez40 recently reported a reduction \\nin the total number of inflammatory cells recruited to the \\nairways, as well as a muted expression of CD11b, while oth -\\ners have reported a blunted phagocytic ability on the sputum and circulating phagocytes.41 Compared with nonasthmat -\\nics, the levels of IL-1b and IL-18 and the expression of TLR2 \\nand TLR4 remained stable after LPS (30,000 EU) inhala -\\ntion, but were elevated in nonasthmatics.40 In contrast, at low \\nLPS levels (10,000 EU), asthmatics demonstrated significant \\nupregulation of the cell-surface markers associated with \\ninnate immunity and antigen presentation (CD14, CD11b, \\nCD16, HLA-DR, CD86, FceR1), and an increased expression \\nof the genes that modulate antigen presentation (HLA-DR, \\nMCP1), immune activation (CD14, IL-1 β), and inflamma -\\ntion (ICAM1, i κBα).56 In vitro  evidence also shows that small \\nconcentrations of endotoxin ( <1 ng/mL) activate alveolar \\nmacrophages causing the release of several proinflamma -\\ntory mediators,57 again suggesting that low-dose endotoxin is \\nan innate immune stimulant or primer. Although the dose–\\nresponse effect of endotoxin is also present in nonasthmatics, \\nit may be more significant in susceptible populations such as \\nasthmatics. For example, it has been established that asthmat -\\nics require a lower dose of LPS to elicit bronchoconstriction \\nand inflammation than that required by nonasthmatics.56,58 \\nOverall, the evidence suggests that the effect of dose is clearly \\nimportant when describing the toxic effects of endotoxin on \\nasthma.

The patient also noted increased nasal \\ncongestion, postnasal drainage, sneezing, and rhinorrhea \\nduring the spring, summer, and fall months. Pulmonary \\nfunction testing revealed a forced vital capacity (FVC) of \\n1.75 (119% predicted), a forced expiratory volume in 1 sec \\n(FEV1) of 1.47 (113%), and a forced expiratory flow at \\n25%–75% (FEF25–75) of 1.65 (100%) without response to a \\nbeta2-agonist bronchodilator. A mannitol challenge, which \\nis a surrogate indirect provocation method that is used to \\ndiagnose exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), was \\npositive, revealing a decline in FEV1 of 30% at the 5 mg dose \\n(normal <15% fall in FEV1 postchallenge). Skin prick testing \\n(SPT) to inhalants indicated sensitization to cockroaches, \\ndust mites, trees, grass, ragweed pollens, and Alternaria \\nmold spores. An exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) test was nega -\\ntive (value of 12) indicating no evidence of airway inflam -\\nmation. Based on the patient’s tests, avoidance measures \\nto dust mites and cockroaches were provided, and he was \\nstarted on a nasal corticosteroid to reduce his nasal con -\\ngestion during exercise, and control his underlying seasonal \\nallergic rhinitis. He was also instructed to use a short-acting \\nbeta2-adrenergic agonist 15 min before all exercise activity. \\nA follow-up visit 4 weeks later revealed that he was now able \\nto complete all of his training workouts and his times during \\ncross-country meets had significantly improved. His nasal congestion was also dramatically improved, as he was now \\nable to breathe through his nose while running. A 6-month \\nfollow-up evaluation was recommended.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nEIB is defined as a transient narrowing of the lower airway \\nwith an associated increase in airway resistance, during \\nor following exercise.1–3 EIB is a more accurate descriptor \\nof this condition than is exercise-induced asthma (EIA), \\nbecause exercise induces bronchoconstriction, not asthma, \\nand not all EIB is associated with chronic asthma.4 Indeed, \\nthe term exercise-induced asthma  should be abandoned.3\\nThis chapter addresses the two forms of EIB: EIB in \\npatients who do not have evidence of chronic asthma (called \\nEIB alone); and EIB in patients who also have chronic \\nasthma (called EIB with asthma). EIB alone, which is less \\ncommon, occurs with strenuous exercise, and it has been \\nstudied in schoolchildren, armed-forces recruits, and highly \\ncompetitive and elite athletes.1,5–8 EIB alone may be consid -\\nered a form of injury-related lung disease. The more common \\ncondition, EIB with asthma, is seen in as many as 90% of \\nasthmatic patients.1–3 In contrast, EIB alone without known \\nasthma is seen in 40%–50% of patients who have allergic \\nrhinitis, 10% of the general population, and as many as 60% \\nof elite or highly competitive athletes.1–3 The prevalence of \\nEIB in athletes who do not otherwise have asthma depends \\non the intensity and the duration of exercise and is particu -\\nlarly prevalent in the most strenuous endurance sports, with 12Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction\\nChristopher Randolph and John M.

Thus, \\nice hockey, cross-country skiing, skating, cycling, mountain \\nbiking, swimming, rowing, and track and field (“athletics”) \\nhave the highest prevalence of EIB alone without known \\nasthma (ranging to about 60%). Less strenuous sports, such \\nas badminton, baseball, and diving, have a lesser prevalence \\nof EIB.9,10\\nEIB with asthma may represent the earliest sign of asthma \\nin childhood and may be the last sign to resolve after an \\nexacerbation.1 The prevalence of EIB in patients who have \\nunderlying chronic asthma depends on the sport or activity, \\nthe environment, and the degree of control of the underly -\\ning asthma.1–4 EIB reflects the control (or lack of control) of \\nasthma and the evidence of airway bronchial hyperreactivity. \\nThe more severe the EIB is, the more poorly controlled the \\nchronic asthma will be.2,4 In the latest Expert Panel Report \\n(EPR) of the National Asthma Education and Prevention \\nProgram (NAEPP-3), EIB is listed as an important indica -\\ntor of the impairment of pulmonary function.11 EIB exacer -\\nbations suggest the need to increase controller therapy for \\nunderlying asthma.1–4\\nA history of respiratory symptoms alone, during or fol -\\nlowing exercise, is not reliable for the diagnosis of EIB.1–4,12,13 \\nEIB is identified by establishing objective evidence for a fall \\nin postexercise FEV1 of at least 10% from its preexercise \\nvalue, after 8 min of strenuous aerobic exercise. Exercise is \\nconducted to achieve at least 80%–95% of the maximum \\nheart rate as a surrogate for a maximum voluntary ventila -\\ntion (MVV) of 40%–80% of the predicted maximum.1–3,14 In \\nchildren aged 3–6 years, a fall in FEV in one-half second \\n(FEV0.5) may be used to define EIB.15 The fall in FEV1 may \\nbegin during exercise; in 80% of patients, the fall in FEV1 \\noccurs between 5 and 12 min and rarely as late as 30 min \\npostexercise.16 Recovery from the bronchoconstriction occurs \\nwithin 30–60 min after exercise is completed.17 Repeated \\nexercise within 2–4 h may lead to a refractory period in 50% \\nof individuals, in which exercise does not induce additional \\nbronchoconstriction.17\\nThis chapter describes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, \\npresentation, diagnosis, and management (both pharmaceu -\\ntical and nonpharmaceutical) of EIB alone and EIB with \\nasthma. The appropriate management of EIB should allow \\npatients, whether recreational or elite athletes or nonathletic \\npatients with activity-induced symptoms, to have a healthy \\nlifestyle, with the ability to participate in physical activity, \\nincluding their selected sports activities.1–4\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nThe prevalence of EIB varies with the population being \\nstudied, including age, sex, ethnicity, urbanization, exercise \\nlevel of intensity, type of exercise challenge, criteria for a \\npositive test, the presence or absence of chronic asthma, and \\nenvironmental conditions, including the season in which \\nthe challenge is being performed.3,18 EIB may be suggested \\nwhen a patient has a fall in FEV1 or peak expiratory flow (PEF) from prechallenge to postexercise. Some authors have \\nconsidered a fall in peak flow of 15% following a 6-min \\nfree-running test to be diagnostic of the condition. Such falls \\nin PEF are common in children. In one study in a South \\nWales population of children aged 12 years, the prevalence \\nwas 6.7% in 1973, 7.7% in 1988, and 4.7% in 2003. The \\nlower prevalence in 2003 was attributed to an increased use \\nof inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).19,20 In a study of adoles -\\ncent athletes participating in a variety of sports, who were \\nexamined prior to their participation, 9.4% had a positive \\nchallenge after a free-running exercise, with a positive chal -\\nlenge defined as a fall of at least 10% in FEV1 by 15 min \\npostchallenge.21 In a second study, high-school athletes were \\nexamined on a treadmill prior to their participation, with a \\npositive test defined as a fall of at least 10% in FEV1, and \\n28% had a positive challenge.22\\nIn a third study, eucapneic voluntary hyperventilation \\n(EVH) was used to screen athletes in a Midwestern high \\nschool.23 A positive challenge was defined as a fall of at least \\n10% in FEV1 or a fall of at least 20% in FEF25–75 or a fall \\nof at least 10% in PEF at 1, 5, and 10 min postchallenge.23 \\nOf the athletes, 38% had a positive challenge. A follow-up \\nstudy by the same authors using a similar protocol in adults \\nwho had no history of asthma showed that 19% had a positive \\nchallenge.24\\nThe socioeconomic impact of EIB was demonstrated \\nin two surveys in Ghana performed 10 years apart (1993 \\nand 2003) using a 6-min free-running test among children \\naged 9–13 years. The urban rich children demonstrated an \\nincreased prevalence of EIB from 4.2% to 8.3%, whereas the \\nurban poor children had an increased prevalence from 1.4% \\nto 3.0% and the rural poor prevalence increased from 2.2% \\nto 3.9%.25,26\\nIn Algeria, a 6-min free-running test was used to screen \\nschoolchildren, with a positive result defined as at least a \\n15% fall in PEF within 10 min of the challenge.

Thus, the \\nprevalence not only varies with the form of the exercise but \\nalso with the type of challenge that is used to elicit EIB (sur -\\nrogate or exercise).3 Other factors related to the presence of \\nEIB include environmental factors such as chlorinated pools, \\nice hockey rinks surfaced with fossil fuel, a family history of \\natopy, uncontrolled asthma, lower respiratory illness, a per -\\nsonal history of atopy, and urbanization.4\\nEIB has an impact on physical functioning including \\nschool activities and emotional functioning in quality of life. \\nThis impact was demonstrated in studies in high-school ath -\\nletes and in children in Tokyo with EIB with and without \\nasthma, and in telephone surveys of parents of 4- to 17-year-\\nold children with current asthma and adults aged 18 years \\nand older.40–43\\nChildren with EIB were profoundly impacted with lower \\nscores in the areas of physical functioning, emotional func -\\ntioning, and school activities compared with those without \\nEIB.42 In the telephone survey, the most frequently reported \\nsymptoms of EIB were cough, wheezing, and shortness of \\nbreath. In a large survey of EIB, more than 1 in 5 (22.2%) of \\n4- to 12-year-old children with EIB avoided selected activi -\\nties and almost 1 in 3 (31.8%) of 13- to 18-year-old adoles -\\ncents with EIB reported avoidance of activities related to \\nEIB.41,43 Parents reported that asthma impacted their chil -\\ndren “a lot or some” in 30% of sports or recreation activi -\\nties, in 30.9% of normal nonsports-related activities, and in \\n26% of other outdoor activities. Despite the frequency of \\nEIB, only 23% stated that they used bronchodilators always \\nor most of the time and 43.4% reported that they “never” \\nused bronchodilators.41 Parents frequently express worries \\nthat asthma may limit exercise in their children; however, \\nif they were properly educated and their children’s EIB was \\nbetter managed, these concerns could be resolved in most \\ncases.44PATHOGENESIS (TABLE 12.1)\\nThe physiological determinant for EIB is the transfer or loss \\nof water from the airway surface in response to the inspira -\\ntion and conditioning of large amounts of dry air in a short \\nperiod of time.1–3 There are two theories for the evolution \\nof EIB; the more widely accepted osmolar theory and the \\npossibly contributory thermal theory. The osmolar theory \\npostulates that mediator release follows degranulation of the \\nmast cells caused by a hyperosmolar environment created \\nby dehydration.1–3,25,45 The thermal theory suggests that EIB \\nis a vascular event with vasoconstriction as a result of air -\\nway cooling and reactive hyperemia following rewarming1–3 \\n(Table  12.1).\\nThe evaporation of water results in the cooling and dehy -\\ndration of the airway. Dehydration creates a hyperosmolar \\nenvironment that leads to degranulation of the mast cells \\nwith a mediator release, including histamine, tryptase, leu -\\nkotrienes, and prostaglandins, as well as chemotactic fac -\\ntors leading to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, most \\nnotably eosinophils but also lymphocytes and neutrophils. \\nThis response is also associated with reverse axonal sensory \\nnerve mediator release. This orchestrated release of media -\\ntors, cytokines, and chemokines contributes to bronchial \\nsmooth muscle constriction, airway inflammation charac -\\nterized by dense infiltrates of inflammatory cells (lympho -\\ncytes and eosinophils), and increased inspissated mucus \\nsecretions and cellular debris due to the denudation of the \\nbronchial epithelial cells. Epithelial cell injury leads to an \\nincrease in transglutaminase 2, which regulates phospholi -\\npases and the leukotriene pathway. Leukotrienes are more \\npredominant than prostaglandins in the airways of patients \\nwith EIB and they play a significant role in inducing bron -\\nchoconstriction mediated by the sensory nerves and the \\nrelease of mucus from goblet cells (MUCSAC).25 Thus, EIB \\nis the outcome of the dehydration of the airway leading to \\na hyperosmolar environment. Extensive studies of the air -\\nway cells, mucosa, epithelium, exhaled breath condensate, \\nproteomics, the genetics of the airway mucosa, sputum, and \\nbronchoalveolar lavage support the osmolar mechanism of \\naction for EIB.25\\nEIB alone without known asthma in the competitive or \\nelite athlete is postulated to be due to an overuse injury \\nto the airway. Hyperventilation, often of cold and dry air, \\nresults in compensation by the airway down to the smaller \\nairways, where there is an enhanced risk of injury to the \\nepithelium.1–3,25,46 Plasma exudation occurs in the repair \\nTABLE 12.1\\nPathogenesis1–3,25\\nEIB alone Syndrome of overuse injury in competitive or \\nelite athletes\\nEIB with asthma Osmolar theory with contributory thermal \\ntheory peripherally with cold air\\nNote:  Pronounced leukotriene production is regulated by epithelial \\ninjury via transglutaminase (TGM2) and phospholipase A2.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 131}),\n"," Document(page_content='114 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nprocess so that repeated exposure leads to smooth muscle \\nhyperresponsiveness and EIB.45,46 This is seen in endurance \\nathletes, particularly those exercising in cold climates, and \\nswimmers.45,47–50\\nCLINICAL PRESENTATION OF EIB\\nThe symptoms of EIB include cough, wheeze, chest tight -\\nness (or chest pain in children), shortness of breath, dyspnea, \\nexcessive mucus production, and “feeling out of shape” even \\nthough the individual is really in an acceptable physical con -\\ndition.3,13,51–57 The signs and symptoms may also be vague, \\nincluding poor performance, heavy legs, muscle cramps, sore \\nthroat, and stomachache.3,13,36,51,52 Post-race cough is the most \\ncommonly reported symptom in elite athletes. Nevertheless, \\na sensitivity/specificity analysis did not demonstrate the \\neffectiveness of self-reported symptoms as a negative or \\npositive predictor of changes in the pulmonary function after \\nexercise.3,13,52\\nRundell noted that in elite cold-weather athletes, 91% of \\nEIB-positive athletes had at least one symptom whereas 48% \\nof EIB-negative athletes also had at least one symptom.3,13 \\nParsons et al. reported similar findings in collegiate athletes, \\nwith both EIB-positive and EIB-negative athletes having a \\nsimilar prevalence of symptoms.54 This is consistent with \\nother studies that show that the percentage change in FEV1 \\nfrom pre- to postchallenge follows a normal distribution, sug -\\ngesting that there is no specific cut point for a fall in FEV1 \\nthat distinguishes between those individuals with or without \\nEIB.51\\nAdditionally, exercise-induced dyspnea is one of the most \\ncommon symptoms of EIB. It has been demonstrated that \\nmany individuals who are thought to have EIB have other \\nconditions that contribute to or precipitate their symptoms, \\nincluding exercise-induced hyperventilation, exercise-related \\nlaryngomalacia, exercise-precipitated vocal cord dysfunc -\\ntion, nasal congestion, gastroesophageal reflux disease \\n(GERD), cardiac abnormalities, and poor conditioning.58,59 \\nIn one study, only 8% of children presenting with exercise-\\ninduced dyspnea had EIB; the remaining 92% had another \\ndiagnosis that manifested as EIB.59\\nDIAGNOSIS OF EIB (TABLE 12.2)\\nA self-reported history alone does not predict who will have \\na positive exercise challenge and therefore it is not reliable for \\nthe diagnosis of EIB. The outcome of a challenge may also \\nbe modified by the training environmental conditions and \\nthe level of competition, particularly in competitive or elite \\nathletes.3,12–14,30,55,60–65 Therefore, an evaluation of EIB man -\\ndates objective pulmonary function monitoring with exer -\\ncise at 85%–90% of the maximum heart rate (40%–80% of \\nMVV). This level of exercise may be achieved by exercising \\nfor 6 min (in children) and 8 min (in adults) at a minute venti -\\nlation of at least 17.5–21 times FEV1 and up to 30 times FEV1 \\nfor EVH. The latter two ventilation rates equal 60%–85% \\nof MVV .3,14,55,65 Interestingly, when exercise is performed in a laboratory (e.g., on a treadmill) rather than in the venue \\nin which an athlete participates, there may be a high rate of \\nfalse-negative results for EIB. This may be due to the natural \\nvariability of EIB, but it is likely to be impacted more by \\nfactors that affect the airway response, including type, dura -\\ntion, and intensity of exercise, temperature and humidity of \\nthe inspired air, pollutants in the air, time since the last epi -\\nsode of EIB, and the duration of medication withholding14,55 \\n(Table  12.2).\\nThe most commonly used and effective procedure for \\nthe diagnosis of EIB is a laboratory exercise treadmill chal -\\nlenge, which uses a protocol that incrementally increases the \\nexercise intensity rapidly over 2–4 min followed by 6–8 min \\nof strenuous exercise for a total of 10 min. The ventilation \\nfor athletes should be more than 21 times the FEV1 during \\nthe final 8 min. Protocols generally encourage that patients \\nbreathe medical-grade dry air with a nose clip, while running \\nor cycling at a level sufficient to increase the heart rate to \\n80%–95% of the maximum heart rate (max HR = 220 – age \\nin years).14,55\\nFree running or running on a treadmill may be preferable \\nto cycling because ventilation increases more rapidly when \\nrunning. Again, as noted above, the patient should breathe \\ndry air to ensure a low water content of inspired air. The \\napparatus to produce cool air is considerably more complex \\nand few laboratories provide both dry and cool air. If avail -\\nable, cool air may be preferable in skiers to simulate the natu -\\nral environment in which they participate.1–3\\nThere is a natural variation in the airway reactivity to \\nexercise so that a single negative test may not be sufficient \\nto rule out EIB.14,55 As many as 25% of individuals without \\nknown asthma but with exercise-induced symptoms may \\nhave one positive test and one negative test when an exer -\\ncise is repeated under the same conditions over a short span \\nof days.14 A natural variation can also occur with known \\nasthmatic patients in whom exposure to allergens or irri -\\ntants can temporarily increase the severity of EIB and the \\nelimination of these factors will diminish the severity of \\nEIB.65\\nGenerally, elite athletes should be evaluated using a \\nsports-specific exercise that reproduces the symptoms in the \\nlaboratory that occur “on the field”.3,30,35 The environmen -\\ntal conditions, including temperature, humidity, pollen level, \\nand pollution index, may impact the response on the field and \\nare difficult to replicate in the laboratory.\\nMeasurements of FEV1 are made in duplicate at 0, 3, 5, \\n10, 15, 20, and 30 min after exercise and the highest (best) \\nvalue at each postexercise stage is used in the calculations. \\nFull FVC maneuvers should not be performed postexercise; \\nan FEV1 lasting at least 2 sec but no more than 3 sec leads to \\nless fatigue than a full FVC maneuver.1–3,55\\nThe percentage fall in FEV1 is:\\n100×− (\\n)Bestprechallenge FEV\\nlowest best postchallenge FEV\\nBest1\\n1\\npprechallenge FEV \\n1', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 132}),\n"," Document(page_content='115 Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction\\nwhere the lowest FEV1 postchallenge is the best (highest) \\nFEV1 at the stage with the largest fall in FEV1.\\nThe diagnosis of EIB requires at least a 10% fall in FEV1, \\npreferably at two or more time points postchallenge.

EVH is the recommended test for Olympic ath -\\nletes. Mannitol is a graduated dose–response test, which has \\nintrinsic safety and may provide the level of sensitivity (e.g., \\nusing the response–dose ratio [RDR]). In contrast to other \\nchallenges, patients undergoing EVH may be more suscep -\\ntible to severe reactions with extreme falls in FEV1.1–3\\nEVH was developed in the 1980s to evaluate armed-forces \\npersonnel for EIB. The EVH test requires inhalation of a \\nfixed dry gas mixture containing 4.9%–5% carbon dioxide, \\n21% oxygen, and the remaining balance of nitrogen.66 The \\nprocedure necessitates hyperventilation of the dry gas mix -\\nture for 6 min at 30 times FEV1 to reach about 85% of MVV. \\nThe higher ventilation achieved (vs. 17–21 times FEV1 with \\nexercise) and the use of dry air result in a low rate of false-\\nnegative outcomes for EIB. However, EVH is a challenge \\nwithout a standardized dose response and is very potent with \\nthe potential for a larger fall in FEV1 than that with a gradu -\\nated test such as the inhalation of mannitol (or methacholine). EVH should probably not be the first challenge performed \\nfor individuals with a documented diagnosis of asthma.66 \\nHowever, EVH has been useful in the diagnosis of previously \\nundiagnosed elite athletes and in excluding asthma in others \\npreviously clinically diagnosed as having EIB.67–69 The dis -\\nadvantages of EVH are a sore throat from breathing dry air, \\nthe need for a very low-resistance breathing circuit, and, as \\nnoted, severe falls in FEV1.1–3 Following the EVH challenge, \\nFEV1 is evaluated for about 30 min. A sustained fall in FEV1 \\nof at least 10% following EVH is consistent with EIB68,70,71; \\nEVH is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of \\nasthma in Olympic athletes who are being screened for EIB. \\nNevertheless, general screening of all elite athletes for EIB \\nwith EVH is not recommended, as there is a relatively low \\nprevalence of EIB among these athletes, suggesting that a \\nhistory of EIB is unreliable.12\\nFor individuals with known asthma, a mannitol dry pow -\\nder challenge could be the initial procedure to evaluate the \\npotential for EIB.

Athletes per -\\nforming in cold and dry environments, in swimming pools, \\nor on ice rinks with air polluted with irritants may have \\nairway hyperresponsiveness secondary to injury. In these \\npatients, a methacholine challenge is not recommended for \\nthe diagnosis of EIB because a positive methacholine chal -\\nlenge merely reflects nonspecific airway injury.

The severity of EIB may be \\ndiminished in some patients by inspiring warm and humid \\nair during exercise.83 Nevertheless, severe EIB can still \\ndevelop in patients inhaling hot dry air.84 Thus, it is impor -\\ntant to recognize that the principal stimulus for EIB is loss \\nof water rather than airway rewarming. Medications that are \\neffective in blocking the physiological effects of the bioac -\\ntive mediators released from inflammatory cells as a result of \\nthis hyperosmolar state in the airway are useful in preventing \\nEIB.85–90\\nbeta-agon Ists\\nTo prevent EIB, either inhaled short-acting beta-agonists \\n(SABAs) or long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) can be \\nadministered 15–30 min prior to exercise on an intermit -\\ntent basis in the majority of individuals.91–93 SABAs have an \\nonset of action within 5–20 min with a duration of activity \\nof about 2–4 h.91,94,95 Inhaled beta-agonists inhibit EIB by \\nactivating two sites of beta2-receptors on the mast cells to \\ninhibit mediator release and on the bronchial smooth muscle \\nto block contraction in response to mediators including hista -\\nmine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D2.1\\nBeta-agonists alone are able to treat the bronchoconstric -\\ntive component of EIB, but they have no impact on inflam -\\nmation.95,96 A tolerance to beta-agonist therapy develops with \\ndaily administration at the level of both the mast cell and the \\nairway smooth muscle within a week of regular use and this \\ntachyphylaxis is not impacted by simultaneous therapy with \\nICS.1–3\\nTolerance is reflected first by shortening the dura -\\ntion of protection to 2 h with SABAs and to 4–6 h with \\nLABAs.95,97–102 Additionally, the time to recovery to baseline \\nFEV1 following exercise may be extended after prolonged \\nuse of beta-agonists. The dose of inhaled beta-agonists \\nneeded to achieve protection may be higher if a daily beta-\\nagonist is administered.103,104 The EIB episode may be more \\nsevere with daily administration of a beta-agonist.104 The \\nlikely mechanism of tolerance is a decreased number or a \\ndownregulation of beta2-adrenergic receptors on the mast \\ncells.97,105 Tachyphylaxis is often managed by increasing the \\ndose of the beta-agonist prior to exercise, making the prob -\\nlem even worse. Intermittent use of a beta-agonist, no more \\nthan three times a week, for prophylaxis or treatment, is most \\neffective in preventing tachyphylaxis.106 The discontinuation \\nof a beta-agonist for 3 days will generally lead to a return of \\nresponsiveness to beta-agonists.101\\nantIchol Inerg Ic agents\\nAnticholinergic agents, such as ipratropium bromide, have \\nbeen inconsistent in attenuating EIB; however, it is clear \\nthat some patients do respond to this therapy.

Ipratropium has been used alone and in \\nconjunction with SABAs for acute exacerbations of asthma, \\nbut it has not been consistent in double-blind, placebo-con -\\ntrolled investigations and intrapatient variability has been \\nreported.107–110\\nchro Mones and nonstero Idal \\nantI-Infla MMatory  agents\\nChromones are mast cell stabilizing medications that block \\nEIB.111 These agents, including sodium cromoglycate and \\nnedocromol sodium, are administered by inhalation, imme -\\ndiately prior to exercise, to provide up to 60% inhibition of \\nEIB; but they are no longer available in the United States.111 \\nComplete inhibition of EIB is defined as a fall in FEV1 postex -\\nercise of no more than 10%.1,2 The duration of these agents’ \\nprotection is usually less than 4 h, but their onset of action is \\nimmediate so they can be inhaled just prior to exercise on an \\nas-needed basis.2,112 Tolerance has not been reported to the \\nrecurrent administration of these drugs. These agents report -\\nedly work by inhibiting the release of prostaglandin D2 and \\nleukotrienes.112 Unfortunately, the armamentarium of medica -\\ntions to treat EIB has been significantly weakened since these \\nagents are no longer available.\\nleuKotrIene antagon Ists\\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) such as monte -\\nlukast and zafirlukast and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors such as \\nzileuton provide approximately 60% protection against EIB. \\nMontelukast is the most commonly used agent. It is adminis -\\ntered as a tablet and should be taken about 2 h prior to the activ -\\nity so that it can be fully effective.113 Although it is not effective \\nfor all asthmatic patients, it can provide protection for as long \\nas 24 h.114,115 Unlike beta-agonists, montelukast can be taken \\ncontinuously, daily, prophylactically, and without tolerance \\ndeveloping.115 Montelukast promotes the recovery of FEV1 to \\nbaseline by decreasing the time to recovery and it diminishes \\nthe duration and severity of the asthma episode following exer -\\ncise.1–3 Combination therapy with loratidine may provide effec -\\ntive attenuation of EIB with a decreased mediator release.116–118 \\nZafirlukast, a second leukotriene antagonist, has a duration of \\naction of about 8 h.117,118 Zileuton, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, \\nhas a duration of prophylaxis for EIB of 4 h, equivalent to zaf -\\nirlukast, but it is less efficacious by 8 h than zafirlukast, monte -\\nlukast, and salmeterol and there is no difference between it and \\nplacebo by 12 h.118–120\\nnonphar Maceut Ical Maneuvers\\nNonpharmaceutical maneuvers that can attenuate or provide \\nprophylaxis against EIB include hydration and inspiring air \\nconditioned to the physiological temperature and humidity, \\nwhich may provide 80% or more protection, similar to medi -\\ncations113,117,118,121–125 (Table 12.3).

This may decrease the number \\nof airway generations required for adjusting the inspired air \\nto the physiological conditions.1–3 Finally, recurrent exercise \\nrepeated within a limited period of time from the first exer -\\ncise (e.g., about 2 h) will lead to a refractory period of tol -\\nerance to further bronchoconstriction.122 Warming up with \\naerobic exercises, such as short sprints with the achievement \\nof 40%–60% of the maximum heart rate, may attenuate EIB, \\nparticularly in conjunction with SABAs.126–129 Agents such \\nas ascorbic acid, fish oil, and dietary sodium restriction have \\nbeen demonstrated to attenuate EIB in small, placebo-con -\\ntrolled trials.130–132\\nAPPROACH TO TREATMENT \\nOF EIB WITH ASTHMA\\nAs described earlier, SABA or LABA may be administered \\nup to 30 min prior to exercise, as many as three times a week, \\nto prevent mild intermittent episodes of EIB. Tolerance to \\nSABA and LABA occurs after only a few doses and is indi -\\ncated by decreased bronchodilation when these drugs are \\ngiven for an asthma exacerbation, even with concomitant \\nICS therapy.101,104,133–135 This tolerance may lead the patient or \\nhealth-care provider to further increase the use of beta-ago -\\nnists with a greater chance of adverse events and no increase \\nin efficacy. However, despite the concern regarding the daily \\nuse of beta-agonists leading to tolerance and impairing the \\nresponse to emergency therapy for asthma, there are lim -\\nited data to support that this tolerance is clinically impor -\\ntant in the elite athlete.62 With competitive and elite athletes \\nwho exercise daily or even more frequently, the use of beta-\\nagonists for prophylaxis during or following exercise could \\ntheoretically lead to exceeding the optimal guidelines for \\nbeta-agonist monotherapy stated in the National Heart, Lung, \\nand Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the Global Initiative for \\nAsthma (GINA) guidelines and tolerance could then poten -\\ntially be of clinical importance.1–3,62\\nIf asthma is more persistent and not well controlled, then \\neither montelukast or ICS may be started. Montelukast is \\nadministered once a day at night, with onset within about \\n2 h and a duration of about 24 h. Montelukast is effective in \\nat least one-half of asthmatic patients but the other half will \\nhave no improvement with this drug. No tolerance develops \\nto montelukast, as occurs with beta-agonists. ICS therapy \\nis indicated for persistent asthma that is mild to severe and that does not respond to beta-agonists or montelukast1,2: \\n(Table  12.4).\\nNonsteroidal medications, such as the mast cell stabiliz -\\ners (MCS), cromolyn (cromoglycate), or nedocromil, are also \\ndeemed effective for chronic mild persistent asthma as stated \\nin previous NHLBI guidelines. Cromolyn has been demon -\\nstrated to be effective versus a placebo in decreasing the fall \\nin FEV1 after a EVH challenge in the most competitive or \\nelite athletes with EIB.112 These findings support the impor -\\ntance of the mast cell mediator release in EIB severity. The \\nlimitation of the study is that cromoglycate was compared in \\na single dose with a placebo, and not with an active compara -\\ntor.62,112 In a Cochrane analysis of 20 randomized, controlled \\ntrials, nedocromil (4 mg inhaled 15–60 min prior to exercise) \\nsignificantly diminished the severity and the duration of EIB \\nin both adults and children.111 A Cochrane analysis of eight \\nstudies demonstrated no significant difference between cro -\\nmolyn and nedocromil in the maximum decrease in FEV1, \\ncomplete protection (defined as the maximum percentage \\nfall in FEV1 less than 10% from baseline), clinical protec -\\ntion (defined as 50% improvement over a placebo), or side \\neffects.136 Unfortunately, as noted earlier, neither agent is \\nmarketed or sold in the United States, the United Kingdom, \\nor Europe.\\nICS therapy is indicated in both adults and children \\nwho have chronic persistent asthma not responsive to beta-\\nagonist and montelukast. When administered on a daily \\nbasis, these agents have been demonstrated to be effective \\nin decreasing the severity of EIB.1–3 The dose and the dura -\\ntion of the therapy are dependent on the various prepara -\\ntions.1–3,121 ICS therapy is the most widely utilized and the \\nmost effective inhaled anti-inflammatory therapy preferred \\nin both the NHLBI and GINA guidelines.1–3 ICS therapy \\nprevents asthma episodes and enhances quality of life and \\npulmonary functions, while diminishing airway inflamma -\\ntion and hyperresponsiveness as well as the severity and \\nfrequency of exacerbations and mortality.137,138 Used in the \\nrecommended doses, ICS therapy requires days to weeks \\nto become fully effective. The onset of the effects of ICS \\ntherapy usually requires 7–14 days, and is most efficacious \\nafter 8 weeks of treatment.64 ICS may be administered in \\nvery high doses a few hours prior to exercise for EIB alone \\nin competitive athletes, but this is not recommended as an \\nongoing clinical practice.139\\nOur understanding of the efficacy of ICS therapy is \\nderived from similar studies lasting from 3 weeks to 2 years \\nin children and adults.

However, \\nin individuals with an abnormal baseline spirometry, the \\ncombination of ICS with LABAs has been demonstrated \\nto be effective in decreasing the severity of EIB.142,143 \\nCombination therapy with LABAs, including salmeterol \\nand formoterol, is often used in the management of asthma \\nthat is not controlled with ICS therapy alone. The combina -\\ntions (of ICS with LABA) are usually prescribed in fixed \\ncombinations, but may be administered as separate inhalers. \\nThe use of monotherapy with LABAs for chronic or persis -\\ntent asthma is never recommended on a continuous basis \\nbecause of the danger of adverse outcomes with therapeutic \\nfailure and the danger of asthma exacerbation.144 However, \\na review of the literature indicates that combined flutica -\\nsone and salmeterol was more effective than fluticasone \\nalone for the prophylaxis of EIB with asthma.145 Similarly, \\nin a randomized, double-blind investigation, combination \\ntherapy with budesonide and formoterol was more effective \\nin improving asthma control and symptoms compared with \\nbudesonide alone.146 As noted above, a pilot study in chil -\\ndren with clinically stable asthma, who were being treated \\nwith a combination therapy (ICS and LABA), demonstrated \\nthat the removal of the LABA reduced the severity of EIB \\nand may even have eliminated EIB.141 This observation sug -\\ngests that ICS alone may be more effective over time than \\nthe combination of ICS and LABA for EIB. Indeed, patients \\nshould attempt to discontinue the inhaled beta-agonist prior \\nto exercise to determine if EIB is still present. This policy \\nwill avoid administering inhaled beta-agonists when these \\nagents are unnecessary.1\\nAn evidence-based review of the literature reveals that \\nSABA provided greater protection than MCS in 12 stud -\\nies.79 However, combining SABAs and MCS provided no \\nfurther benefits in five studies. LTRAs, MCS, ipratropium \\nbromide, and interval warm-up routines demonstrated \\na statistically significant reduction in EIB with asthma, \\nmeasured as the mean difference in the percentage fall in \\nFEV1 and 95% confidence intervals when compared with a \\nplacebo. Nine studies demonstrated the efficacy of single-\\ndose interventions with LTRA (8.9% mean difference); 17 \\nstudies with nedocromil sodium (15.6% mean difference); \\n4 studies with interval warm-up (10.6% mean difference); \\n4 studies with ICS (5% mean difference); 2 studies with continuous high-intensity warm-up (9.8% mean difference); \\nand 3 studies with continuous low-intensity warm-up ver -\\nsus no warm-up (12.6% mean difference).79 Notably, after \\ndaily LABA use for 3–4 weeks in four studies, the percent -\\nage fall in FEV1 following an exercise challenge at 2 and \\n4 weeks was greater than at day 1, presumably related to \\ntachyphylaxis. Interestingly, both SABA and LABA con -\\ntinue to lessen EIB in patients with known asthma when \\ngiven prophylactically even though the effect of these drugs \\nis diminished by tachyphylaxis with a prolonged time to \\nrecovery.79,95,97–103\\nSupplements to the diet such as fish oil and vitamin C as \\nwell as a low-salt diet have been demonstrated to be effec -\\ntive for protection against EIB.147,148 However, these studies, \\nwhile often placebo controlled, were performed in individu -\\nals with mild EIB and do not apply to the more severe forms \\nof EIB.147,148 Agents such as heparin, theophylline, furose -\\nmide, and calcium channel blockers have also been evalu -\\nated as therapy for EIB, but there is insufficient evidence to \\nrecommend their routine use.1–3\\nMaintaining physical conditioning may raise the thresh -\\nold for EIB.149,150 For the elite athlete, national and global \\nguidelines and standards as well as regulations must be fol -\\nlowed. For the elite athlete with EIB alone, the use of ICS in \\nlarge doses (i.e., beclomethasone at 1500 μg given 4 h prior \\nto exercise) or cromolyn sodium or beta-agonists given \\nprior to exercise have some demonstrated efficacy112,139; but \\na reduction in prolonged training and the avoidance of trig -\\ngers in the environment may be the only effective manage -\\nment of EIB.1–3 Chronic use of ICS is less effective in the \\nsetting of neutrophil predominance with EIB alone.1,2,62,82\\nCONCLUSION\\nEIB is the most specific and earliest presentation of asthma \\nand the last to resolve with an asthma exacerbation. This \\ncondition generally reflects underlying asthma control (or \\nlack of control) but it may present alone in highly com -\\npetitive or elite athletes. EIB has bronchoconstrictive and \\ninflammatory components. The diagnosis of EIB requires \\npulmonary function evaluation with an exercise or surro -\\ngate challenge. A differential diagnosis includes poor con -\\nditioning, vocal cord dysfunction, nasal congestion, and, \\nrarely, cardiac or other pulmonary conditions. The manage -\\nment of EIB should follow the general guidelines that the \\nNHLBI has developed or the more recently published prac -\\ntice parameter on EIB so that the exercising individual may \\npursue a healthy lifestyle with the ability to participate in \\nthe exercise of choice.3\\nDECLARATION OF INTEREST\\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to report.

Currently, she has ongoing poor \\nsymptom control despite being prescribed a combination \\nhigh-dose ICS/LABA. An assessment of her asthma manage -\\nment skills and knowledge indicates that there are a number \\nof areas that require addressing. Asthma education will be \\nintegral to Lucy’s management of her asthma.Asthma education not only involves the transfer of infor -\\nmation and knowledge, but it also incorporates strategies to \\nimprove skills and change attitudes, ultimately leading to \\nbehavioral change.1 This approach is termed asthma self-\\nmanagement education .\\nIn this chapter, we will describe the essential components \\nof effective education and discuss best-practice recommen -\\ndations. We will also present evidence supporting asthma \\nself-management education in a number of different patient \\npopulations.\\nASTHMA EDUCATION\\nThere is unequivocal evidence to support asthma self-man -\\nagement education and its ability to improve the morbidity \\nof this disease in both children and adults2–6; as such, asthma \\nself-management education is fundamental to optimal \\nasthma management.\\nSelf-management support is defined as “the systematic \\nprovision of education and supportive interventions by health \\ncare staff to increase patients’ skills and confidence in man -\\naging their health problems, including regular assessment \\nof progress and problems, goal setting, and problem-solving \\nsupport. Self-management is defined as the tasks that indi -\\nviduals must undertake to live well with one or more chronic \\nconditions. These tasks include having the confidence to deal \\nwith medical management, role management, and emotional \\nmanagement of their conditions.”7\\nMeta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCT) \\nhave identified the essential components of asthma self-\\nmanagement education.3,6,8,9 The most effective programs \\ninclude the transfer of information, skills training, regular \\nmedical follow-up, the delivery of written asthma action \\nplans (WAAPs), and regular monitoring of symptoms or lung \\nfunction by the patient. These are achieved through effective \\ntherapeutic patient–clinician partnerships using a person-\\ncentered approach (Figure 13.1). While successful asthma \\nself-management programs have considerable variability, \\nthey remain a multifaceted intervention and are most effec -\\ntive when their components are delivered in combination \\nrather than as individual aspects.3,10\\nAsthma self-management education can be delivered in a \\nvariety of settings. Improvements in asthma knowledge and \\ncontrol have been demonstrated in programs delivered in the \\nprimary care outpatient, hospital, and emergency department \\nsettings as well as through the internet and mobile phone \\ntechnologies.11 The programs that have reported the best out -\\ncomes are those that are implemented in secondary care set -\\ntings in patients with moderate to severe asthma.12\\nESSENTIAL COMPONENTS \\nOF ASTHMA EDUCATION\\ndevelop Ing effect Ive patIent–clInIcIan partnersh Ips\\nThe development of effective patient–clinician partnerships \\nis an important aspect of asthma self-management.

The concept of “patient \\ncenteredness” was first presented in the medical literature in \\nthe mid-1950s by Balint,13 who contrasted this concept with \\nillness-centered medicine. Since then, several definitions \\nof person-centered and patient–client-centered care have \\nemerged in the literature. The paradigm of person-centered \\ncare relates to holism, suggesting that patients be treated \\nfrom a biopsychosocial perspective.14 Person-centered care \\nis, therefore, the treatment and care provided by health ser -\\nvices that place the person at the center of his or her own \\ncare.15 This is necessary to deliver effective asthma self-man -\\nagement education (Figure 13.1). A definition of this concept \\nof care is as follows:\\nA collaborative effort consisting of patients, patients’ \\nfamilies, friends, the doctors and other health professional \\nachieved through a comprehensive system of patient educa -\\ntion where patients and health professionals collaborate as a \\nteam, share knowledge and work towards the common goals \\nof optimum healing and recovery.15\\nThe hallmark features of person centeredness concern \\nthe creation and maintenance of respectful and collaborative \\nrelationships between patients, their families, and health-\\ncare staff, and the recognition of individuality. Practicing \\nperson-centered care involves treating patients as partners, \\ninvolving them in decision making, improving their auton -\\nomy, and respecting their beliefs and concerns. Health-care \\nproviders should respect and establish the contribution that \\nthe patients or their families make to their own health, such as their values, goals, past experience, and knowledge of their \\nown health needs, and the patients and their families should \\nrespect the contribution that health-care providers can make, \\nincluding their professional expertise and their knowledge \\nand information about the options available. Both the health-\\ncare provider and the service user are important within the \\npartnership; neither is interchangeable.15 Person-centered \\ncare is particularly well suited to the needs of people with \\nasthma during the educative process.\\nPerson-centered care requires the clinician to have an \\nappreciation of the patient’s expectations, beliefs, and con -\\ncerns; an understanding of the patient’s personal circum -\\nstances; a willingness and motivation to provide information \\nsurrounding the diagnosis, pathology, treatment, and progno -\\nsis; and the knowledge to inform evidence-based treatment \\ndecisions.16–18\\nPoor patient–clinician partnerships have negative effects \\non health outcomes. By including patients in the deci -\\nsion-making process, outcomes such as adherence can be \\nimproved. A recent study in an asthma population by Wilson \\net al.19 examined the effect of shared decision making com -\\npared with clinician decision making among patients with \\nasthma, using adherence to controller therapy as the out -\\ncome. In the shared-decision group, treatment was negotiated \\nwith the participants who had the opportunity to summarize \\ntheir treatment goals, were provided with information about \\nthe necessary treatments for disease control, and were pre -\\nsented with a range of treatment options, which enabled \\nthem to make a shared decision with the clinician.

These content areas can be addressed during the \\ninitial consultation, and they can be reinforced and reviewed \\nduring follow-up consultations.\\nWith respect to the transfer of information, asthma educa -\\ntion should include:\\n• The provision of information relating to the nature \\nof asthma and its mechanisms\\n• Asthma treatment, including the concept of differ -\\nent classes of asthma medication, when to use medi -\\ncations, possible side effects, and ways to minimize \\nthese side effects\\n• The concept that asthma is a long-term condition \\nand, as such, the requirements for treatment are also \\nlong term\\n• Practical information about how to use the inhaled \\ntherapy, inhaler cleaning instructions, and informa -\\ntion about knowing when the device is empty\\n• Recognizing the signs and symptoms of worsening \\nasthma and what to do if they occur\\n• Ways of preventing exacerbations\\n• Trigger identification, avoidance, and management\\n• An assessment of adherence and discussions focus -\\ning on adherence-aiding strategies\\n• The importance and benefits of self-monitoring\\n• WAAPs\\n• The need for regular follow-up\\nIn terms of asthma management skills, inhaler technique \\nassessment and correction are vital as are the initiation of \\nself-monitoring of the symptoms and/or peak flows, the pre -\\nscription, and an agreement on a written action plan that \\nincludes the course of action to take following an increase in \\nasthma signs and symptoms.1,4\\nInhaler  techn Ique\\nAdequate skill in the use of inhaler devices is integral to achiev -\\ning good asthma outcomes. The majority of asthma medica -\\ntions are delivered via the inhaled route, as this offers the \\nbest balance between efficacy and safety.20,21 Unfortunately, \\nas many as 90% of patients have poor\\xa0inhalation technique.22 The assessment and correction of inhaler technique are \\nessential features of asthma education, and can effectively \\novercome errors and improve outcomes.23 A number of known \\nfactors can increase the error rate for inhalation devices and \\nthese factors need to be considered when educating patients \\nand choosing the inhaled therapy. Both older people and \\npeople with more severe airflow obstruction are at greatest \\nrisk of poor inhaler technique, which is related to decreased \\ncognitive function and manual dexterity in older people and \\nreduced peak inspiratory flow rates in both older people and \\nthose with severe airflow obstruction.20,24 Furthermore, data \\nsuggest that there is a lack of education and instruction on \\ninhalation technique among patients who are prescribed \\ntreatment; as many as 25% of asthma or chronic obstructive \\npulmonary disease (COPD) patients have never been pro -\\nvided with inhaler device instruction.25 This may be related \\nto clinicians’ confidence to educate patients, as other data \\nsuggest that the proportion of health professionals who are \\nunable to demonstrate adequate inhaler technique is between \\n31% and 85%.26 The document “Inhaler Technique in Adults \\nwith Asthma or COPD” (http://www.nationalasthma.org.\\nau/uploads/content/237-Inhaler_technique_in_adults_with_\\nasthma_or_COPD.pdf) details the essential steps that are \\nrequired to develop an adequate technique for each of the \\nmost common inhaler devices used in asthma treatment. The \\nfollowing is a TEACHER mnemonic to aid in the vital steps \\nfor inhaler technique education.\\nTailor:  Individualize the device to the patient’s needs.\\nEducate:  Educate and demonstrate the correct technique.\\nAssess:  Assess the patient’s ability for using the device.\\nCorrect:  Correct the technique.\\nHave Another Go:  After correction, reassess.\\nEvaluate:  Is this the correct device for this patient?\\nReduce:  Minimize the number of devices prescribed.\\nThese include the need to individualize the choice of \\ninhaler to the individual patient’s skill and preference; the \\nneed to explain and demonstrate to the patient how to use the \\ndevice, and why an effective technique is important; the need \\nto assess the patient’s technique and to correct the essential \\nsteps when necessary; and the continued evaluation of the \\npatient’s technique as his or her proficiency may decrease \\nover time. Finally, we recommend minimizing the num -\\nber of different devices prescribed to avoid inhaler device \\npolypharmacy.21\\nOver time, there has been a progressive increase in the \\ntypes of inhalation devices used in the management of \\nasthma and other obstructive airway diseases; this has led \\nto the frequent problem of inhaler device polypharmacy, \\nwhich is the use of multiple types of inhalation devices by \\none individual.21 We have previously demonstrated that this \\nis a common problem among adults with asthma and that \\nan inadequate inhalation device technique is most common \\namong patients using three or more delivery devices.21 As \\nthe array of devices continues to increase, this is becoming a \\nvery important issue to address.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 148}),\n"," Document(page_content='131 Asthma Education\\nTABLE 13.1\\nContent of Asthma Education Consultations\\nCase Study “Lucy”\\nNature of Disease\\nProvide basic patient-centered review of respiratory anatomy and asthma physiology, including \\nthe concept of asthma as an inflammatory disease and the concept of airway narrowing\\nAsthma Treatment\\nConcept of asthma medication classes\\nActions—relievers for bronchoconstriction; preventers for airway inflammation\\nWhen to use medication\\nPossible side effects and ways to minimize\\nInhaler Technique\\nAssess inhaler technique\\nCorrect inhaler technique\\nContinually reassess and correct inhaler technique at follow-up\\nAssess and, when possible, correct inhaler device poly-pharmacyNeeds correction\\nMinimize the number\\nSelf-Monitoring\\nEstablish patient preference for self-monitoring\\nHave the patient understand the rationale for self-monitoring\\nCommence either peak flow or symptom monitoring based on the patient’s ability and \\npreference\\nContinually review self-monitoring at follow-upCommenced on peak flow and symptom \\nmonitoring\\nAsthma Control\\nEnsure the patient understands the concept of good asthma control\\nEnsure the patient is able to recognize the signs and symptoms of worsening asthma and knows \\nthe actions to takePoor control\\nPoor recognition\\nGiven WAP\\nWritten Action Plan\\nPrescribe a written action plan\\nInclude the patient in the decision-making process\\nEnsure the patient understands and accepts the treatment recommendations\\nProvide the patient with prescriptions for the recommended treatments\\nReinforce the plan at follow-up\\nReview the plan following each exacerbation or every 6 monthsPlan developed\\nScripts given\\nKnowledge and agreement of plan \\nassessed\\nAdherence\\nAssess adherence to treatment\\nEstablish reason for nonadherence in a supportive and nonjudgmental way\\nDiscuss ways to implement adherence-aiding strategiesRequires ongoing assessment and review\\nTriggers\\nIdentify relevant trigger factor with the patient\\nProvide advice on trigger factor management\\nReview regularly\\nSmoking N/A\\nEstablish smoking status\\nEngage in discussions about smoking cessation\\nIndividual Patients’ Needs\\nEstablish what is important to each patient\\nEnsure patients’ needs are addressed\\nAllow time to explore patients’ questions and concerns\\nFollow-up/review\\n, assessed and adequate; , assessed and inadequate; N/A, not applicable.\\nSource:  Adapted from McDonald, V .M. and Gibson, P.G., Allergy Frontiers: Diagnosis and Health Economics , Springer Publishing, Japan, \\n2009.

Self-monitoring is useful as it provides patients with \\na tool for assessing their level of asthma control and aids in \\nthe recognition of the early signs of an exacerbation. Self-\\nmonitoring also assists clinicians in reviewing the level of \\nasthma control over time and the results provide clinicians \\nwith data to determine the action to be taken at certain points \\nof the early exacerbation written action plan.\\nIn children, it appears that symptom-based action plans \\nare superior to peak flow-based plans, but it is not known if \\nthis is related to differences in adherence for either option.9 \\nIn adult patients, a number of studies have compared the \\ntwo forms of monitoring and a meta-analysis concluded that when self-monitoring is coupled with a written action \\nplan, the results from symptom or peak flow monitoring are \\nequivalent.27 One study did, however, show that patients pre -\\nferred symptom monitoring over the use of peak flow28 and \\nwhile adherence to self-monitoring can be poor, the notion \\nof establishing individual patient preferences is important in \\ndetermining the approach each patient might take.\\nWhile the effects of peak flow or symptom monitoring are \\nequivalent, each has its pros and cons.

In some \\npatients, symptoms may deteriorate before a fall in the peak \\nflow is evident; in this group of patients, symptom monitor -\\ning is preferred.29\\nA number of other factors should also be considered \\nwhen establishing and reviewing self-monitoring prac -\\ntices with patients.

A chart display also influences the \\nability to recognize deteriorating asthma.30\\nregular  revIew\\nA regular medical review is another key element contributing \\nto the success of asthma self-management education.3 The \\nreview provides practitioners with the opportunity to assess \\nasthma control, measure lung function, review treatment \\nresponse, and reinforce asthma knowledge and skills.\\nThe key questions to assess during the review are the \\nfrequency of symptoms, including nocturnal awakening \\nand symptoms on waking up in the morning. The degree of \\nactivity limitation and the frequency of short-acting beta2-\\nadrenergic  agonist use should also be elicited, as should the \\nexacerbation history.\\nDue to the time pressures faced by medical practitioners, \\nasthma education opportunities may be limited during both \\nthe initial consultation and at follow-up review. Working in \\npartnership with asthma educators, specialist nurses, and \\nallied health professionals will increase the asthma educa -\\ntion opportunities for patients.\\nwrItten asthMa actIon plans\\nExacerbations are a common feature in asthma, putting the \\npatient at immediate risk for distress, hospitalization, and \\neven death. Acute exacerbations represent a significant con -\\ntribution to health-care costs.24 Exacerbations may occur \\nover days or weeks and, as such, patients frequently have \\nan opportunity to recognize their deterioration and escalate \\ntheir treatment to reduce both the severity of the exacerbation \\nand the recovery time. WAAPs are used to facilitate asthma \\nmanagement, particularly exacerbation management.1,31\\nWAAPs are developed by a medical practitioner or an \\naccredited nurse practitioner to provide patients with written \\ninstructions, either in the form of text31 or as pictorial informa -\\ntion,32 about their maintenance treatment and instructions for \\nthe escalation of treatment during both moderate and severe \\nasthma exacerbations. WAAPs allow people with asthma \\nto detect the early signs and symptoms of exacerbations in \\naddition to providing instructions about how to manage these \\nexacerbations.1 They are an essential component in the effec -\\ntive self-management of asthma,3 and are a key recommenda -\\ntion of international clinical practice asthma guidelines.12,33\\nWhen written action plans are coupled with self-man -\\nagement education there is irrefutable evidence to support \\ntheir effect on reducing asthma morbidity.3 Unfortunately, \\nthe uptake of WAAPs in practice remains poor.34 A popula -\\ntion survey in South Australia demonstrated that the propor -\\ntion of people who stated that they had a WAAP was 42% \\nin 1995, which fell to 20.8% in 2003.34 The reasons for the \\nlow-level uptake of WAAPs by health-care professionals are \\nlikely to be multifactorial; it may reflect the poor training \\nof doctors and other health professionals in creating and delivering negotiated action plans in partnership with people \\nwith asthma,35 suggesting a need for additional training in \\nself-management plans among health professionals. It may \\nalso be related to the time required for medical practitioners \\nto develop and effectively convey the plan to the patient. \\nThis can be overcome by developing asthma management \\nprograms in partnership with asthma educators, specialist \\nnurses, and other allied health-care professionals. Finally, \\nthe poor uptake could be related to the attitudes of clini -\\ncians and patients regarding the importance of such plans. In \\na recent study published by the present authors, the impor -\\ntance of the clinical problems experienced by older people \\nwith asthma and COPD was rated by both patients and their \\nphysicians. The problems related to self-management, includ -\\ning WAAPs,18 received the lowest rating of importance from \\npatients and doctors. This suggests a need to improve clini -\\ncians’ and patients’ knowledge of the efficacy and benefits of \\nwritten action plans.\\nMany different written action plan templates are avail -\\nable to aid both clinicians and patients in completing these \\nagreed treatment plans. Examples may be found at the fol -\\nlowing websites: http://www.nationalasthma.org.au/health-\\nprofessionals/tools-for-primary-care/asthma-action-plans/\\nasthma-action-plan-library (accessed 11/08/12), http://www.\\naaaai.org/Aaaai/media/MediaLibrary/PDF%20Documents/\\nLibraries/NEW-WEBSITE-LOGO-asthma-action-plan_\\nHI.pdf (accessed 11/08/12), and http://asthma.ca/adults/con -\\ntrol/pdf/AsthmaActionPlan_ENG.pdf (accessed 11/08/12).\\nGibson and Powell31 undertook a study to review the evi -\\ndence supporting WAAPs and they recommended that the \\nkey components of WAAPs include detail describing:\\n• When to increase treatment (action point)\\n• How to increase treatment\\n• For how long\\n• When to seek medical help\\nAn example of a WAAP incorporating these components \\nfor the “Lucy” case study is presented in Figure 13.3. In addi -\\ntion to the written component, engagement with the patient is \\nalso essential to ensure that he or she understands the plan, \\nagrees to the treatment recommendations, and has the capac -\\nity to implement all elements of the plan.\\nadherence\\nAdherence to medical advice is a well-known problem \\nin people with asthma,36 and as health professionals, we \\nneed to recognize and expect nonadherence. The reality \\nthat patients do not always follow the prescribed treat -\\nment advice has been evident for thousands of years.

While these terms are frequently used \\ninterchangeably, they have different meanings that must be \\nrecognized.\\nThe now largely outmoded term compliance refers to the \\nextent to which the patient’s behavior matches the prescrib -\\ner’s advice.36 Compliance is associated with negative conno -\\ntations as it infers that a paternal relationship exists between \\nthe patient and the prescriber in which the role of the pre -\\nscriber is to issue treatment and the role of the patient is to \\nfollow orders.36,38The preferred term ‘adherence’ refers to the extent to which \\na patient’s behavior with respect to their medication, diet or \\nlifestyle is consistent or matches the recommendations of the \\nprescriber.36,38\\nIn contrast with the term compliance, adherence is \\nintended to be nonjudgmental rather than attributing blame \\nto the patient, prescriber, or treatment.38,39 Moreover, adher -\\nence refers to both the underuse and overuse of medications \\nand therapies.38 However, in asthma the most frequent form \\nof nonadherence is the underuse of treatment.12\\nThe term concordance is a more complex notion that \\nrelates to the relationship between the patient and the pre -\\nscriber, which is based on equality and respect and considers Case Study : Lucy’s Wr itten As thma Ac tion Plan\\nWhen We ll\\nSeretide 250/25 mcg ______________   D ose: T wo puﬀs via your spacer morning and nigh t\\nVentolin* 100 mcg  ________________    D ose: T wo puﬀs as needed\\nTake Ventolin t wo puﬀ s 10 minute s before e xerci se\\nWhen Not W ell\\n•If your p eak ﬂow reading do es not reach 80 % of your b est value, whic h is 320 L/m following your\\nmedication for a 24 hour p eriod.\\nor\\n•If you are waking at night due to your a sthma or ha ve symptoms when you wake in the morning .\\nor\\n•If you re quire your V entolin more fre quently than usual and are not getting the same eﬀ ect.\\nor\\n•You are getting a cold.\\n/T_hen\\n•Incre ase your V entolin: T ake two extra puﬀs a s needed. \\n•Start prednisone 37.5 mg a da y for 14 d ays.\\n•See your do ctor if you are no b etter in 2–3 d ays of incre ased  treatmen t.\\nFor a Se vere At tack\\n•If your p eak ﬂow do es not reach 50 % of b est value, which is 200 L/m.\\nor\\n•If you ha ve a se vere shor tness of breath and can only s peak in shor t sentences .\\nor\\n•If you are ha ving a se vere attack of a sthma and are frightene d.\\nor\\n•If you need to take your V entolin more than 4 hourly and do not gain an eﬀ ect.\\n/T_hen\\n•Take Ventolin four puﬀs in your spacer : rep eat if you do not improve.\\n•Take 50 mg of pre dnisone.\\n•Seek me dical attention imme diately by calling an ambulance on 000.\\n•Continue to use your V entolin in your spacer four puﬀs e very 4 minutes until help arrive s.\\nSignature_______________________________ Date__________________\\n∗Change d from terbutaline due to p oor technique and inhaler p oly de vice pharmac y. \\nFIGURE 13.3  (See color insert) An example of a written asthma action plan.

In a meta-analysis of 569 studies, adherence to therapy \\nin respiratory diseases ranked poorly, with a mean adherence \\nrate of 68.8%, which was fifteenth out of seventeen different \\ndiseases.40 A prospective study of asthma found that 24% of \\nsevere exacerbations were attributable to nonadherence.41\\nThere are two distinct patterns of behavior associated \\nwith nonadherence, which are referred to as intentional and \\nunintentional nonadherence.36,38,42 Understanding the behav -\\nior pattern of nonadherence in individuals will guide their \\neducation and help develop adherence-aiding strategies.\\nIntentional nonadherence occurs when patients make \\npurposeful decisions to take and perform treatments in a \\nway other than that prescribed. This often refers to the self-\\nadjustment or titration of treatment according to the patient’s \\nsymptoms or beliefs, or the cessation of treatment earlier \\nthan prescribed.36 Intentional nonadherence usually results \\nwhen the patient weighs the risks against the benefits of tak -\\ning medication and makes a decision based on his or her rea -\\nsoning.38 While intentional nonadherence may result from \\na balance of reasoning, the decision could result from poor \\nknowledge about the treatment, or an erroneous understand -\\ning regarding the nature or consequence of the problem, the \\nprescribed therapy, and the potential benefit of treatment. \\nTherefore, this form of nonadherence can often be addressed \\nthrough strategies that improve patients’ knowledge and \\ninfluence their health beliefs and concerns.38\\nUnintentional nonadherence occurs when patients do not \\nadhere to treatment advice due to reasons out of their con -\\ntrol.36 These are often related to cognitive impairments, lan -\\nguage barriers, and physical disabilities. In the case of an \\nolder person with asthma, this could relate to impaired vision \\nor musculoskeletal problems affecting his or her ability to \\nuse inhaled medications. Further unintentional nonadher -\\nence could also result from ineffective communication or \\ninaccurate recollection of the prescribed treatment prescrip -\\ntion.36 Studies of how well patients retain health information \\nsuggest that less than 50% of the information conveyed by \\nthe physician is recalled immediately after an office visit.40\\nRecognizing nonadherence, establishing the reasons for \\nnonadherence, and working with patients to improve their \\nadherence are essential elements of asthma education.\\nASTHMA EDUCATION IN \\nDIFFERENT POPULATIONS\\nAsthma self-management education has been tested in many \\ndifferent patient groups, including adults, children and ado -\\nlescents, elderly people, pregnant women, and culturally and linguistically diverse populations. Evidence supports asthma \\nself-management education in these populations and recog -\\nnizes that the education should be tailored to the specific \\nneeds of the population.12\\nadults\\nMany RCTs of asthma education have been conducted in \\nadults with asthma and the results of these trials have been \\nsummarized in Cochrane systematic reviews.3,10 One review \\nexamined limited education that included the provision of \\ninformation only. The review included 12 RCTs, and the \\nresults indicated that the provision of information alone was \\neffective in terms of improving knowledge but it did not \\nreduce asthma morbidity, hospital admissions, or unsched -\\nuled doctors’ visits for asthma. Furthermore, these stud -\\nies showed that the provision of information alone did not \\nimprove lung function or reduce medication use. From this \\nanalysis, it can be concluded that limited education involv -\\ning the transfer of information alone improves knowledge but \\nnot asthma health outcomes.10 A second systematic review \\nevaluated 36 RCTs comparing self-management education \\nwith usual medical care. This analysis demonstrated that \\nself-management education is effective in reducing hospital -\\nizations, emergency department and unscheduled physician \\noffice visits, as well as reducing days off work or school, \\nreducing nocturnal asthma, and improving patients’ quality \\nof life. The estimated number needed to treat (NNT) with \\nasthma self-management education in order to prevent 1 \\nasthma hospitalization is 20 and to prevent one emergency \\ndepartment visit the NNT is 8.11 The authors conclude that \\nasthma self-management education that includes the provi -\\nsion of information, self-monitoring by either PEF or symp -\\ntoms, regular medical review, and a WAAP improves the \\nhealth outcomes for adults with asthma.3\\nolder people\\nOlder people with asthma are an important population as the \\nmorbidity and mortality from asthma in this population is \\nhigh.43 The optimal self-management education for older peo -\\nple with asthma is still unclear. In the majority of the studies \\nincluded in the previously described systematic review,3 the \\nparticipants were a mean age of less than 52 years and older \\npeople were excluded in some of the trials.3 While asthma \\ndeaths have fallen in younger populations over the last few \\ndecades, Australia, for example, has witnessed a rise in mor -\\ntality in older adults.44 While advances in pharmacotherapy \\nand self-management education policy initiatives have led to \\npositive outcomes in younger people with asthma, the same \\nhas not been seen in older people, suggesting that the results \\nof these RCTs cannot be extrapolated or applied to older pop -\\nulations who remain at risk.20\\nWhile less data exist related to self-management tech -\\nniques in older people, a small number of recent tri -\\nals have examined interventions in this population. Patel \\net\\xa0al. showed that a telephone interview intervention could ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 153}),\n"," Document(page_content='136 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nimprove outcomes in older people with asthma. This inter -\\nvention improved the use of ICS use, decreased emergency \\ndepartment attendance, and increased the uptake of WAAPs \\nin older participants with asthma compared with a control \\ngroup.45\\nHuang et al. also conducted a RCT in older people with \\nmoderate to severe asthma involving telephone interventions. \\nThis trial had three arms: usual care, individualized edu -\\ncation with weekly telephone consults, and the former plus \\npeak flow monitoring. Written information was provided in \\nlarge fonts and used pictures with few words. Participants in \\nthe two intervention arms demonstrated significant improve -\\nments in their asthma knowledge and skills, self-care behav -\\niors and self-efficacy, and prebronchodilator FEV1 compared \\nwith a control group.46 In another RCT, Goeman et al. evalu -\\nated the effectiveness of a multifaceted educational interven -\\ntion for GPs aimed at improving the outcomes of older people \\nwith asthma. In this study, GPs received an educational inter -\\nvention that was designed to improve the care of older people \\nwith asthma. This educational intervention was associated \\nwith improved content and style in communication, but it \\ndid not improve patient outcomes. It should be noted that the \\nbaseline characteristics of the patient population in this study \\ndid indicate good baseline asthma control, which may have \\nlimited the room for improvement.47\\nThese studies suggest that older people with asthma can \\nbe instructed in an effective self-management program and \\nachieve improvements in self-management efficacy,46 qual -\\nity of life,48 and lung function.46 The benefits of asthma self-\\nmanagement education come from integrated programs with \\nactive involvement by the participant.\\npregnant  woMen\\nIrrespective of the level of asthma severity, exacerbations of \\nasthma in pregnant women are common. Achieving good \\ncontrol in this population is vital, as uncontrolled asthma \\nduring pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and \\nfetal outcomes.49 Asthma self-management education in this \\npopulation has been shown to improve asthma knowledge \\nand skills. Murphy et al.50 conducted a study in which preg -\\nnant women were recruited from the antenatal clinic of a ter -\\ntiary hospital. The women were interviewed by an asthma \\neducator at 20 and 33 weeks gestation. Their asthma knowl -\\nedge and skills were poor at the baseline visit but improved \\nsignificantly following education by the asthma educator, \\nsuggesting that asthma self-management education should be \\nintegrated into standard antenatal care.50\\nAn important aspect of asthma education for pregnant \\nwomen is to ensure that they understand the importance \\nof good asthma control in order to avoid poor maternal \\nand fetal outcomes. The safety of asthma treatment dur -\\ning pregnancy must also be stressed, as pregnant women \\nmay have concerns about using their treatment and a mis -\\nconstrued understanding of the risk of taking medications \\nduring pregnancy may lead to poor adherence and adverse \\noutcomes.chIldren\\nThere is good evidence of the benefits of self-management \\neducation for children with asthma.8 A number of systematic \\nreviews have evaluated the value of asthma self-management \\neducation in pediatric and adolescent populations.2,6,8,9 While \\nthe setting and the type of intervention vary, the reviews are sup -\\nportive of educational intervention for children with asthma. In \\nthe most comprehensive review by Wolf et al., the effects of self-\\nmanagement education in children were evaluated. Thirty-two \\nRCTs were included, and the results of the analysis indicated \\nthat self-management education of children was associated \\nwith improvements in airflow obstruction and self-efficacy. \\nFurthermore, education was also associated with a reduction in \\nemergency department presentations and reduced absenteeism \\nfrom school.6 Asthma self-management education is recognized \\nas standard practice in children and adolescents with asthma.11,12\\nSUMMARY\\nAsthma self-management education is an effective and inte -\\ngral part of asthma management in both adults and chil -\\ndren. It can be successfully delivered in a variety of settings. \\nThe key components of asthma self-management education \\ninvolve the transfer of information to improve knowledge, \\nskills training, self-monitoring, the prescription of WAAPs, \\nand regular medical review. These components of asthma \\neducation are best delivered in a model of person-centered \\ncare where the needs of the individual patient are understood \\nand effective clinician–patient partnerships are developed.\\nREFERENCES\\n 1.

A chest x-ray and alpha-1-\\nantitrypsin were negative. The patient stated that she had \\nbeen receiving the following medications: fluticasone 110 μg \\ntwo inhalations bid; theophylline 400 mg bid; and albuterol \\ntwo inhalations Q 4 h prn. Her spirometry revealed a forced \\nvital capacity (FVC) of 87%, a forced expiratory volume in \\n1 sec (FEV1) of 62%, and a forced expiratory flow (FEF25–75) \\nof 37% predicted. The patient is currently employed in an \\noffice setting with no exposure to irritant fumes or mold. \\nThe possible factors that precipitated her asthma flare were \\ncheering her daughter at a softball game and playing in a \\nsoftball game in which she did more running than usual. \\nAn adherence evaluation revealed a theophylline level of \\n<2.0 μg/dL and one refill of fluticasone 110 (after her recent \\nadmission) from a local pharmacy in the previous 6 months. \\nShe completed an asthma adherence survey, which identified \\nconcerns about the cost of medicine; corticosteroids side effects; the need for daily preventative inhaled corticosteroid \\n(ICS) treatment; spouse disagreement about medication use; \\nand forgetting to take the medication. An asthma information \\nassessment identified poor comprehension of the action, side \\neffects, and rationale for the daily use of inhaled steroids; no \\nprior use of a peak flow meter; and no written asthma action \\nplan. The physician had recommended discontinuing Theo-\\n24 and QVAR and starting mometasone/fomoterol 200/5 two \\ninhalations bid to improve her asthma control and decrease \\nthe number of insurance medication payments.\\nThe patient received an asthma education program from \\na nurse practitioner (NP) to evaluate the aforementioned \\nproblems/concerns with care. At the outset, the NP asked the \\npatient what area she would like to discuss and the response \\nwas the need for daily asthma treatment. The NP responded \\nthat she would address that issue but explained that she \\nwould need to review information with the patient about \\nasthma and the use of a peak flow meter, which would help \\nanswer the patient’s primary concern. The NP suggested \\nusing the peak flow meter as a way to determine the patient’s \\nneed for daily ICSs.

Unfortunately, many clinicians do not focus on step 3 \\nand do not achieve the desired outcomes of symptom reduc -\\ntion and improved quality of life that are gained by adherence \\nto treatment. This chapter will examine the different reasons \\nwhy individuals fail to follow their clinicians’ instructions \\nand/or recommendations and various interventions that have \\nbeen shown to be effective to improve patient adherence. \\nAdherence to asthma medication will focus on ICS therapy \\nsince it is the most widely used therapy and recommended by \\nthe Expert Panel Report-3, except for mild asthma.\\nKEY CONCEPTS REGARDING ADHERENCE \\nTO ASTHMA THERAPIES\\n• All asthma patients should be evaluated for adher -\\nence at the time of consultation with an asthma \\nspecialist.\\n• Providers should not rely solely on patient report for \\nadherence history.\\n• Adherence is simultaneously influenced by several \\nfactors: characteristics of the disease; concomitant \\ndisorders (e.g., depression and anxiety); treatment \\ntype; socioeconomics; health-care system access; \\nand personal. Each must be considered, preferably \\nat the initial evaluation.\\n• Patient-tailored interventions are recommended \\nsince no one intervention is effective for all.\\n• When patients are identified as nonadherent, they \\nshould be supported and not blamed.\\n• When patients state that they have been nonadher -\\nent, believe them.\\n• Patient-centered communication skills will enhance \\npatient adherence. Assessing the readiness of a \\npatient to accept a medical recommendation is \\nessential.\\n• Physician extenders (NPs, physician’s assistant, \\nand nurses) can work with physicians to promote \\nadherence.\\n• Disease management companies should work with \\nphysicians to optimize care.\\nDEFINITION\\nThe term compliance  has been used to define “the extent \\nto which patients follow physician instructions prescrip -\\ntions and proscriptions.” It implies that treatment decision \\nmaking is entirely the physician’s responsibility and that \\nthe patient must obey or acquiesce.1 Adherence is defined \\nby the World Health Organization as “the extent to which \\na person’s behavior, such as: taking medication, following \\na diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with Adherenc eAdherence managemen t\\nSymptomatic patient\\nDrug A\\nClinician evaluates monitors for adherenc e\\nNonadherenc e\\nAdherenc e\\nevaluation\\nReason(s)\\nfor poor\\nadherenc e\\nSpeciﬁc\\ninter ventions\\nOptimal communication\\ntechnique\\nMonitor for adherence at\\nfollow- up visitDrug B\\nFurther\\nmedical\\nevaluatio n\\nLaborato ry/\\nimag ing/\\nconsultation\\nFIGURE 14.1  Adherence management is appropriate for any \\nchronic disease that requires continuous pharmacological ther -\\napy. Once an individual is identified as nonadherent, an evalua -\\ntion is performed to identify the cause(s); the specific strategy(s) \\nto be implemented; and the appropriate communication technique. \\n(From Weinstein, A.G., Ann.

It requires patients’ agreement to \\nthe recommendations, that patients should be active partners \\nwith health professionals in their own care, and that good \\ncommunication between patients and health professionals is \\na must for an effective clinical practice.2 The WHO definition \\nalso expands the definition of regimen beyond medication. It \\nis important to note that many organizations use the terms \\nadherence  and compliance  interchangeably. Adherence \\nto asthma therapy is essential since it is a chronic disease, \\nrequiring daily medication administration and long-term \\nsupervision by a health-care provider.\\nTO WHAT DEGREE ARE PATIENTS ADHERENT \\nWITH ASTHMA TREATMENT REGIMENS?\\nNonadherence with prescriptions can be classified as pri -\\nmary (failure to get the initial prescription refilled) and sec -\\nondary (underuse of therapy or premature discontinuation \\nof treatment). Primary nonadherence may range from 7% to \\n44%. An Australian study in a primary care setting found \\nprimary nonadherence with asthma medication to be 30%.3 \\nSecondary nonadherence in a U.S. asthma clinic, determined \\nby prescription refill, was 21% for theophylline and 41% for \\nICSs over 12 months.4 The examples of secondary nonadher -\\nence only determine that the medication was received by the \\npatient, but do not provide information regarding its actual \\nuse. The rates of secondary ICS adherence in both children \\nand adults are approximately 50%.5 On examining an insur -\\nance database, Williams et al. determined that approximately \\n50% of adults did not refill ICSs.6 Bender et al. examined \\nrefills of fluticasone/salmeterol over 12 months in over 5500 \\npatients.7 On average, patients filled enough medication to \\ncover 22.2% of days and more than one-half of the patients \\nfilled a 30-day prescription only once over the 1-year period.7 \\nUsing electronic adherence monitors, Onyirimba et al. found \\nthat adherence to ICSs decreased by 50% in 1 week and \\ndropped as low as 20% after 12 weeks.8 Krishnan also found \\na 50% decrease in ICS usage postdischarge from a hospi -\\ntal ICU.9 Jonasson et al. reported on adherence to inhaled \\nbudesonide administered with a breath-driven asthma \\ninhaler in 163 Swedish children.10 Adherence was 70% after \\n6 months and dropped to 60% after 1 year.\\nsIgnIfIcance  of nonadherence  and clInIcal outco Mes\\nNonadherence is related to adverse outcomes. In a review \\nof an epidemiological database, Suissa found that subjects \\ntreated regularly with ICSs for at least 16 days and as long as \\n6 months were 40% less likely to be readmitted for asthma.11 \\nIn another study, Suissa compared the deaths of a known \\nasthma population with a control group of individuals who \\ndied from asthma.12 The rate of death from asthma during the \\nfirst 3 months after the discontinuation of ICSs was higher \\nthan the rate among patients who continued to use the drugs. They concluded that the regular use of low-dose ICSs is asso -\\nciated with a decreased risk of death from asthma. Milgrom \\nexamined the adherence of 24 children aged 8–13 years with \\nmoderate to severe asthma in an outpatient setting.13 They \\nreceived ICSs with an electronic monitor over 3 months. The \\nchildren with low adherence (median 11%) required oral ste -\\nroid bursts while the adherent group (median 64%) did not \\nrequire oral steroids. These findings support the concept that \\nadherence enhances outcomes.\\nWilliams et al. found that less adherent adult patients \\ntreated in a health maintenance organization (HMO) were \\nmore likely to be seen in an emergency department (ED), \\nhospitalized, and receive more oral corticosteroids during \\nthe study period.6 Similarly, Krishnan found that patients \\ndischarged from an intensive care unit who were subse -\\nquently nonadherent with both ICSs and oral corticosteroids \\nhad reduced asthma control as measured by the Asthma \\nControl Test (ACT).9 Murphy et al. examined the prescription \\nrefill data for ICSs of 115 adult asthma patients in a clinic. \\nSuboptimal adherence ( <80%) was found in 65% of patients \\nprescribed ICSs. Patients with suboptimal ICS adherence had \\nreduced FEV1 and higher sputum eosinophil counts.14\\nMethods  to assess adherence\\nThere are a variety of methods to assess a patient’s adherence, \\nwhich are summarized in Table 14.1. Several methods are \\nconsidered here. Self-reporting, asking patients about their \\nmedication use, or keeping a diary are not accurate measures. \\nPatients may not want to disappoint a provider and therefore \\nmay overestimate their medication use.15 As a result, cli -\\nnicians tend to overestimate patient adherence.15 Studies \\ncomparing patient diary with electronic adherence devices \\ndemonstrate the weakness of patient reporting.13 Direct mea -\\nsures, such as blood and saliva measures of theophylline, an \\nTABLE 14.1\\nAssessing Adherence\\nIndirect Methods Direct Methods\\nQuestion the patient Observation\\nAsk patient to complete \\nquestionnaireMeasure levels of medicine (e.g., blood/\\nurine)\\nEvaluate patient diaries for \\ncompletenessMeasure biological marker attached to the \\nmedicine\\nAssess adherence based on \\nresponse to treatmentConduct unannounced spot checks of \\npatients at home/clinic\\nConduct pill counts Measure clinic attendance\\nUse electronic monitors for \\nphysiological markers \\n(e.g., pulmonary function)\\nDetermine from pharmacy \\nwhether prescriptions \\nwere filled\\nSource:  Weinstein, A.G., Ann.

Another disadvan -\\ntage is that the direct measure provides data for one point \\nin time and does not necessarily reflect overall adherence. \\nSome individuals may take a monitored medicine imme -\\ndiately prior to a visit in anticipation of a direct measure. \\nElectronic monitors for metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) have \\nbecome more prevalent in research and practice. Electronic \\nmonitors are able to identify the pattern of medication use for \\nmore than a month, giving the physician the opportunity to \\nreview these results with the patient in relation to symptoms \\nand lung function measures at home. Cochrane observed sub -\\njects who were given an electronic adherence monitor with \\ntheir MDI but were unaware that they were being tracked. \\nThe medication use records of some subjects identified mul -\\ntiple actuations immediately before their clinic appointment, \\nwhich was described as “dumping.”18 The disadvantage of the \\nelectronic monitor approach is its cost. The Doser CT is less \\nexpensive but it only records 30–45 days of data and it does \\nnot generate an electronic record for the clinician regarding \\nthe date and time of use.19 The Smart Inhaler technology is \\nmore expensive but it provides documentation of the patient’s \\nadherence record and it can be applied to a greater variety of \\nthe MDIs (aerosol and dry powder) currently in use. It also \\nprovides audible feedback as reminders and includes wireless \\ncapability to permit remote monitoring.20 These assays and \\ndevices permit clinicians to determine whether symptoms \\nare secondary to treatment failure versus failure to admin -\\nister treatment.\\nPatient questionnaires have been used to assess adherence \\nfor multiple diseases by identifying patient barriers to medi -\\ncation use. Recent questionnaires have been used to assess \\nasthma adherence. Patients self-identify concerns, including \\nthe need for medication, the effectiveness of treatment, and \\nthe cost. McHorney et al.21 developed a three-question sur -\\nvey, the Adherence Estimator, which identifies a patient’s (a) \\nperceived need for medications; (b) perceived concerns for \\nmedications; and (c) perceived affordability of medications, \\nand they related these items to prescription refill data and \\npatient self-report of medication use. The authors felt that \\nthere were some research design problems with this instru -\\nment, specifically that there was a small cohort of asthma \\nsubjects; patients received a mixture of ICSs and leukotri -\\nene modifiers; and there were inaccuracies with patient self-\\nreport of adherence. They suggested that future research with \\na larger sample of asthma patients treated exclusively with \\nICSs would be required before relying on the Adherence \\nEstimator. Weinstein et al. have developed a web-based \\nquestionnaire with 90 items to examine the causes of patient \\nnonadherence.22 The questionnaire was derived from an inpa -\\ntient rehabilitation program for severe asthmatic children. This instrument was subsequently completed by 160 adult \\nasthma patients with all levels of illness severity treated \\nwith ICSs.23 Three factors were identified in this analysis: a \\nsymptom severity factor, a quality of life disruption factor, \\nand an adherence factor. To build on these studies, Schatz \\net\\xa0al.24 enrolled 440 adult asthma patients receiving ICSs and \\nfollowed them for 1 year. They identified five questions: I \\nfollow my medication plan; I do not need preventative treat -\\nment; I forget at least one dose per day; my ICS causes side \\neffects; and I cannot afford my medication. All five questions \\nwere related to asthma control, and the specific barrier ques -\\ntions were related to subsequent adherence or asthma-related \\nhealth-care utilization.\\nPharmacy prescription refill databases have proved valu -\\nable in assessing adherence. Some local pharmacies may be \\nhelpful in giving individual patient prescription refill data. \\nAlthough refill information does not answer the question of \\nactual medication use, it does give data as to whether the \\nmedicine was obtained by the patient. One learns how “per -\\nsistent” the patient is about continuing the prescription over \\ntime, as well as computing “adherence”, the average daily \\nmedication dispensed from the inhaler.8 In the past, HMOs \\nhave had pharmacy databases to assist their clinicians in \\ndetermining if treatment failure may be related to nonad -\\nherence. More clinicians are getting access to these data; \\nadditionally, more local pharmacies are now more willing to \\nprovide refill data.\\nclInIcal Method  to deter MIne adherence\\nOne way to estimate adherence with the patient in the clinic \\nis to ask a question that suggests that most patients do not \\nfollow directions fully. The question is “I wanted to find \\nout how you are doing with the medication regimen we had \\ndiscussed during the last visit. Most patients follow the plan \\n50% of the time. So if they were to take their ICS twice a day \\nfor 1 week (14 times), that would be seven times. How often \\nare you using the ICS?”\\nBy normalizing nonadherence, it offers the patient the \\nopportunity to honestly reply to the question. One must not \\nscold the patient if he or she is nonadherent, but start a dia -\\nlogue on why the patient is having difficulties and determine \\na potential solution that is developed between the patient \\nand the clinician. Choo et al. demonstrated the validity of \\nself-reported nonadherence by comparing patient report, \\npill count, electronic monitoring device, and automated \\npharmacy records. Nonadherence reported by patients can \\nserve as a qualitative indicator and a predictor of reduced \\nadherence.\\ntypes of nonadherence\\nPatients may be categorized by type of behavior and nonad -\\nherence.2 Erratic  patients have difficulty following treatment \\nbecause of the complexity of the treatment or the chaos of \\ntheir lives. They tend to be forgetful, to be too busy with \\nchanging schedules, and frequently run out of medication.

Unwitting  patients \\nmisunderstand the dosing regimen or forget instructions. \\nThey fail to understand the rationale for therapy and do not \\ndistinguish acute from preventative therapies. There may be \\nlanguage barriers or health literacy issues or they may never \\nhave been properly informed by the physician. Intelligent  \\npatients frequently believe that they know more about the \\nappropriate treatment than the provider does. They may say \\nthat they do not need treatment or it is ineffective; they are \\nconcerned about drug dependence, side effects, or addiction; \\nor they have a different cultural belief from the provider.\\nFACTORS OR BARRIERS RELATED \\nTO NONADHERENCE\\nBarriers can be categorized as related to the characteristics of \\nthe disease, the therapy required, the individual patient, the \\nclinician, the practice and health system, or general societal \\nconditions.2 A patient’s barriers may change over time and \\na review of these barriers should be made at each visit. In \\nthe following sections, we discuss the most common barriers \\naffecting asthma management.\\ntherapy -related  factors\\nRegimen factors that may affect adherence include: dura -\\ntion, frequency , complexity , cost, efficacy , and  real or per -\\nceived concerns about side effects . The correct use of MDIs \\nis key, and an incorrect technique may be considered a form \\nof poor adherence. Patients must also differentiate when to \\nsupplement daily ICS use with prn use of rescue medication. \\nIndividuals may not use ICS inhalers because they do not \\nperceive the immediate bronchodilation effect experienced \\nwith beta2-agonists.\\npatIent-related  factors\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, “patient-\\nrelated factors” represent the resources, knowledge, beliefs, \\nperceptions, and expectations of the patient (Videos 14.1 \\nand 14.2).2 Poverty\\xa0may lead to decreased access to medica -\\ntion and health-care providers. Individuals in poverty may \\nhave lower adherence since they have a greater incidence of \\ndepression and stresses that can influence their understand -\\ning of instructions, beliefs, and expectations about treat -\\nment. Age may also be a factor affecting adherence. Older \\nindividuals may forget to take their medicine. Adolescents \\nmay be reluctant to follow medication recommendations because of body image, peer pressure, or autonomy issues \\n(Videos\\xa014.2 through 14.4). The comprehension of asthma \\ncare instructions may be a barrier secondary to poor lit -\\neracy or poor instruction from the\\xa0provider. \\nHealth beliefs are associated with adherence. Individuals \\nwho do not believe that the treatment is effective will not \\nfollow through with the recommendations.26 Distrust of the \\nhealth-care provider leads to less adherence.27 In asthma, low \\nliteracy has been associated with improper use of MDIs.28 \\nOne aspect of literacy may be particularly important: the \\nability to understand and use numerical concepts. Poor \\nnumerical scores have been shown to be related to ED visits \\nand hospitalizations.29 This suggests that the comprehension \\nof numerical concepts can affect outcomes.\\nPatient beliefs about ICSs directly affect their adherence \\nand outcomes. Patients who are concerned about corticoste -\\nroid use may underdose or discontinue long-term use in an \\neffort to be “corticosteroid sparing.”2 A survey of over 600 \\nadult asthma patients was conducted to find out patients’ per -\\nception of the role of ICSs in the treatment of asthma and the \\npotential side effects of asthma. For example, 40% believed \\nthat ICSs were bronchodilators and only 25% were aware \\nthat ICSs reduced inflammation (Videos 14.5 and 14.6).30 \\nThis would suggest that physicians should identify these con -\\ncerns before prescribing ICSs.\\nprovIder-related  factors\\nPhysician communication skills are appreciated by patients \\nand can influence their adherence and outcomes.31 A \\nVIDEO  14.1  Health belief model.http://goo.gl/LTxgCD\\nVIDEO  14.2  Adolescent nonadherence, physician with commu -\\nnication skills: follow-up visit.http://goo.gl/E6Drlz\\nVIDEO  14.3  Introduction.http://goo.gl/eSZ6N4\\nVIDEO  14.4  Adolescent nonadherence, physician with commu -\\nnication skills: initial visit.http://goo.gl/wxnId', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 161}),\n"," Document(page_content='144 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nsignificant body of research supports the concept that provid -\\ners who are friendly and empathetic have the ability to earn \\nthe trust of patients, can relate to the patient at his or her \\nlevel of comprehension, and have the sensitivity to assess and \\novercome patient barriers that will enhance adherence and \\noutcomes (Videos 14.7 through 14.9).32 \\ndIsease-related  factors\\nA primary role of asthma management is to achieve adher -\\nence. Unfortunately, the following characteristics of asthma \\nare associated with poor adherence: the disease is chronic \\nrequiring continuous medication administration, there may \\nbe periods when patients are asymptomatic, and a portion of patients has difficulty appreciating bronchoconstriction \\nrequiring bronchodilator therapy.2\\npract Ice and syste M-related  factors\\nStudies have shown that the organization of the clinic affects \\nadherence to asthma treatment. Fewer patients seen per hour, \\nappointment length, evening hours, multilingual staff, con -\\nsistency of care, ease of making appointments, ease and \\neffectiveness of telephone communication, and use of the \\ntelephone for reminders and follow-ups all promote adher -\\nence.33 At a system level, physicians who have more access to \\npharmacy refill data are more likely to identify patient adher -\\nence. Increasing co-payments for visits and medication are \\none of the causes of nonadherence. By reducing co-payments \\nfor ICSs, one can increase adherence by 5.88%.34\\nINTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE ADHERENCE\\nInterventions should focus on the individual barriers identi -\\nfied by the patient. The approach to overcome these barriers \\ncan focus on the regimen, the patient, and the providers of \\ncare, and can be tailored to the individual patient.2\\nregIMen Intervent Ions\\nAttempts to decrease the complexity of the regimen to once \\ndaily and combining medications into one MDI to reduce the \\nnumber of medicines to be taken have been reported to be \\nhelpful in increasing adherence.35 Patients frequently report \\nthat forgetting is a common cause of nonadherence. One \\nshould carefully assess if forgetting is the “real reason” for \\nmissing medication doses. A patient may use “forgetting” as \\na reason when the individual may have one or more concerns \\nabout the medication prescribed. Incorrect inhaler use is a \\ncommon reason for treatment failure when the patient has \\nbeen “adherent” using a faulty technique. The techniques of \\ninhaling aerosol and dry powder are significantly different. It \\nis essential to review MDI and dry powder inhaler (DPI) use \\nand correct the technique when needed.\\npatIent Intervent Ions\\nGibson et al. in the Cochrane Airways Group reviewed adher -\\nence articles related to asthma interventions.36 Most of the \\nstudies focused on self-management programs. Successful \\nprograms involved self-monitoring of peak expiratory flow \\nrates and symptoms as well as regular medical review and \\nwritten action plans. Studies of adult self-management pro -\\ngrams demonstrated improved health outcomes such as \\na reduction in nocturnal asthma, hospitalizations, physi -\\ncian visits, and missed days at school and work. Superior \\noutcomes were achieved for patients with written asthma \\naction plans who had the ability to adjust their medication. \\nKotses et al. developed an adult self-management program \\nconducted over 7 weeks in which the investigators were \\nnot only able to reduce symptoms and improve control but \\nthey were also able to demonstrate cost effectiveness.37,38 \\nVIDEO 14.5  Steroid phobia, physician with communication \\nskills: initial visit.http://goo.gl/xUYYL\\nVIDEO 14.6  Steroid phobia, physician with communication \\nskills: follow-up visit.http://goo.gl/HKpTCY\\nVIDEO 14.7  Reflective listening.http://goo.gl/LvWtFq\\nVIDEO 14.8  Open-ended questions.http://goo.gl/CmiG3h\\nVIDEO 14.9  Empathy.http://goo.gl/WX2nJi', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 162}),\n"," Document(page_content='145 Adherence and Outcomes\\nOver the short term, self-management training led to fewer \\nasthma symptoms and physician visits and an improvement \\nin asthma management skills and cognitive abilities. Over \\nthe long term, self-management training was related to a \\nlower frequency of asthma attacks, reduced medication use, \\nan improvement in cognitive measures, and an increased use \\nof self-management skills. A cost–benefit analysis indicated \\nthat the program was beneficial, reducing the cost of asthma \\nto each patient by $475.29. The benefits came primarily from \\nreductions in hospital admissions (reduced from $18,488 to \\n$1,538) and income lost as a result of asthma (reduced from \\n$11,593 to $4,589). Thus, the program more than paid for \\nitself.\\nIn another Cochrane review of adherence to multiple \\nchronic diseases, Haynes reported that the most effective \\ninterventions for patients included providing reinforcement \\nfor patients’ efforts to change their health-related behav -\\niors, giving feedback on progress, tailoring the education \\nintervention to the specific needs of the patient, teaching \\nself-management skills, and providing the patient with edu -\\ncational resources.39 McDonald et al. evaluated adult patient-\\nfocused adherence interventions with varying medical \\nchronic diseases.40 Although they recognized that there have \\nbeen significant gains in strategies to improve adherence, \\nmost strategies were too costly, complex, labor-intensive, and \\nof variable effectiveness. They encouraged more innovative \\nstrategies to be developed.\\nProviding patients with feedback about medication use \\nhas been shown to be helpful in increasing adherence to \\nasthma therapies. Onyirimba et al., using electronic monitors \\nto follow adult inner-city women’s use of ICSs, found that \\nthose who were given feedback about their medication use \\nhad higher (78%) adherence during the 10-week outpatient \\nstudy than those in the control group who received no feed -\\nback.8 Weinstein et al. employed theophylline monitoring in \\nthe outpatient phase of an uncontrolled trial of 59 children \\nwith severe asthma who were initially treated in a 10-day \\nrehabilitation protocol.41 Prior to rehabilitation, the median \\nnumber of hospital days was 7, the number of emergency care \\nvisits was 4, and the asthma-related costs were $10,420. Using \\npsychoeducational strategies to improve self-management \\nbehaviors, to assess and remove barriers to adherence, and \\ntheophylline monitoring at each outpatient visit, they were \\nable to achieve reductions in morbidity. Hospitalizations and \\nemergency care visits were zero for all 4 years of follow-up \\nand the cost of care at the fourth-year follow-up was $1940. \\nFurthermore, the median theophylline dose was 7.9 μg/mL.\\nInformation technologies are being developed to utilize \\ninteractive Internet and mobile device platforms to improve \\nasthma knowledge and/or asthma outcomes. Mosnaim and \\ncolleagues conducted an 8-week study in which four low-\\nincome black adolescents aged 12–18 years received 10–15 \\nMP3 tracks with coping messages recorded by their peers \\nas well as twice-daily telephone messages to use their ICS.42 \\nThe researchers found that treatment adherence improved \\nfrom less than 40% to more than 70%, and that asthma con -\\ntrol scores (ACT) improved from 19 to more than 20.42 While this technological research is in its early stages, with small \\nstudies and pilot projects, its findings suggest further study \\nwith randomized trials.\\nRecently, patient-centered communication strategies have \\nbeen introduced to help patients be more consistent with their \\nmedication regimen. Patient-centered approaches are associ -\\nated with better patient retention, adherence, and treatment \\noutcomes, without increased time and cost (Video 14.10).31 \\nMotivational interviewing (MI) is a patient-centered coun -\\nseling approach that can be briefly integrated into patient \\nencounters and is specifically designed to enhance motiva -\\ntion to change among patients not ready to change.32 Existing \\nasthma management approaches (e.g., education and self-\\nmanagement) increase the resistance among patients not \\nready or willing to follow medical recommendations. MI \\nhelps patients resolve their ambivalence about behavior \\nchange and builds their intrinsic motivation before providing \\neducation (Video 14.11). Although MI overlaps with patient-\\ncentered communication, it additionally includes some con -\\ncrete motivational strategies that can be briefly and easily \\nimplemented in medical settings (e.g., setting an agenda, \\nreflective listening (Video 14.7), assessing motivation and \\nconfidence for change (Video 14.12), helping the patient \\nweigh the costs and benefits of change (Video 14.4), and \\nproviding medical advice and health feedback (Video 14.8)). \\nWilson et al.31 used a patient-centered counseling approach, \\nshared-decision making (SDM), to determine its effective -\\nness in increasing adherence and asthma control in 612 \\nadults with asthma.

These findings support the conclusion that negotiating \\npatients’ treatment decisions significantly improves adher -\\nence to asthma pharmacotherapy and clinical outcomes.\\nprovIder Intervent Ions\\nProviders’ acquisition of communication skills is related \\nto adherence.2 Studies have examined how to improve \\nthe communication skills of physicians caring for asthma \\npatients. Clark et al.43 have provided training in communica -\\ntion skills as well as asthma management to primary care \\nphysicians and demonstrated increased anti-inflammatory \\nprescriptions, decreased nonemergency visits, and increased \\npatient satisfaction persisting over 2 years. Cabana,44 apply -\\ning a similar communications asthma education program \\nfor primary care physicians, was effective in improving \\nparent-reported provider communication skills, the number \\nof days affected by asthma symptoms, and asthma health-\\ncare use. Patients with more frequent asthma symptoms and \\nhigher health-care utilization at baseline were more likely to \\nbenefit from their physician’s participation in the program. \\nStudies suggest that having a family member or companion \\naccompany the patient may increase physician and patient \\nquestion-asking times during the visit.45 The Accreditation \\nCouncil for Graduate Medical Education has recognized \\ncommunication skills as a core area of training for residents \\nand fellows in the United States. Skill development includes \\ncounseling patients as well as learning to communicate with \\nhealth-care teams.\\nhealth-care syste M Intervent Ions\\nIn 2008, approximately 22 million Americans were deter -\\nmined to have asthma, 6 million under 18 years of age.46 \\nThe annual cost of asthma care in 2007 was an estimated \\n$19.7 billion, with 456,000 hospitalizations and 1.5 million \\nED visits.47 The cost of nonadherence has been estimated \\nto be $290 billion in 2009, leading to unavoidable medi -\\ncal expenses.48 The 2003 World Health Report emphasizes \\nthe need to think beyond clinicians as the sole intervener to \\npromote adherence to a large population.2 Clinicians can no \\nlonger afford the time to provide personal interventions. In \\na response to the increasing cost of care, the United States \\nhas turned to disease management companies to improve \\npatient outcomes. Disease management , population care , \\nand care management  are similar terms applied to organi -\\nzations with pragmatically indistinguishable “means” in the \\nsystematic pursuit of the same “end”—improved health out -\\ncomes for a population of patients.49 The Asheville Project, \\na frequently cited asthma disease management program, \\nwas successful in reducing morbidity due to asthma as well \\nas congestive heart failure, diabetes, and hypertension.50 A \\ncohort of 207 adult asthma patients with duration of symp -\\ntoms for greater than 5 years received one-on-one asthma education with a pharmacist, who was also a certified asthma \\neducator. They met for one to two sessions. Subsequently, \\nthe patients also met with a pharmacist case manager every \\n3 months. They discussed medication use, symptoms and \\ntriggers, inhaler technique, review of peak flow, and update \\nof asthma action plans. The patients’ spirometry was also \\nmeasured. Adherence was not a main outcome measure but \\nwas assessed by patient self-report. Adherence results were \\ndetermined as spending on medication for the cohort and \\nasthma-related medical claims. The study demonstrated a \\nsignificant reduction in ED visits and hospitalizations. More \\npatients had a less severe National Asthma Education and \\nPrevention Program (NAEPP) asthma severity classifica -\\ntion and a higher spirometry from baseline. Although these \\nimprovements are significant, there is no way to determine \\nhow adherence interventions caused these gains. Because \\nthese patients received medication from the pharmacy in \\nAsheville, an objective measure of adherence could have \\nbeen made pre- and postintervention. By diagnosing adher -\\nence status, clinicians could have made appropriate interven -\\ntions for nonadherent individuals to improve outcomes.\\nTwo disease management outcome studies that focus \\non adherence, one in diabetes and the other involving both \\ndiabetes and cardiovascular disease, are instructive on how \\nadherence measures and interventions can improve the health \\nof a population. Thiebaud et al. prospectively evaluated the \\neffect of telephonic care management within a diabetes man -\\nagement program on adherence to treatment with multiple \\nmedications (hypoglycemic agents, angiotensin converting \\nenzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and \\nstatins) and recommended laboratory tests in a Medicaid \\npopulation.51 The entire intervention population was the \\nfocus of the intervention. The comprehensive telephonic care \\nmanagement model used was delivered by nurse care manag -\\ners who were responsible for tailoring treatment plans to each \\npatient. The care managers influenced adherence in at least \\nfour ways. They encouraged patients to follow through on the \\nprovider’s orders and helped patients to problem-solve adher -\\nence issues. They contacted the provider’s office directly \\nwith information that might result in a new medication or \\ntest order. They sent laboratory kits directly to the patients \\nto ensure that the results were available. The care manag -\\ners also had an indirect influence on adherence to guidelines \\nby educating and empowering patients to partner with their \\nproviders. Care-managed patients increased their scripts for \\nhypoglycemic use by 1.5 scripts ( P < .001) and insulin use \\nby 0.9 script ( P < .001) relative to controls. Care-managed \\npatients with no tests at baseline, experienced a significant \\nincrease in the number of A1C, lipid, and microalbuminuria \\ntests and retinal examinations performed.\\nThe second study by Lawrence et al. focused on a nonad -\\nherent population of patients with diabetes and cardiovascular \\ndisease.52 The objectives of this study were to (1) assess the \\neffectiveness of telephonic intervention in influencing the re-\\ninitiation of medication therapy and (2) evaluate the rate and \\ntiming of medication re-initiation.

The \\ntraining also addressed common barriers to adherence and \\navailable resources, including side effect management, mail \\norder benefits, drug assistance programs, medication orga -\\nnizers, and reminder systems. The intervention group had a \\nsignificantly higher rate of medication re-initiation (59.3%) \\nthan the control group (42.1%; P < .05). Time to re-initiation \\nwas significantly shorter in the intervention group than in \\nthe control group (59.5 [ ±69.0] days vs. 107.4 [ ±109] days; \\nP < .05). This initiative demonstrated that a targeted disease \\nmanagement intervention promoting patient behavior change \\nincreased the number of patients who re-initiated therapy \\nafter a period of nonadherence and decreased the time from \\nnonadherence to adherence. In both studies, nonphysicians \\nwere the agents of change using behavioral techniques and \\nadherence to treatment as the guideline.\\nBecause of its low cost and its ability to reach large popula -\\ntions, disease management and population health studies are \\nutilizing interactive voice recognition (IVR). IVR has been \\nused to collect adherence and other health data.53 The system \\nuses voice-processing technology to link individuals with a \\ncomputer database. Prerecorded voice files generally prompt \\nthe caller to press telephone buttons to answer questions or \\nrequest information. The IVR system can then retrieve the \\nappropriate health or resource information by accessing the \\nhost computer’s database and provide it to the patient.\\nA recent study from a HMO evaluated IVR in a poorly \\ncontrolled adult asthma population ( n = 50), all of whom \\nhad been prescribed an ICS.54 Calls were completed in less \\nthan 5 min and included content that was designed to inquire \\nabout asthma symptoms, deliver core educational messages, \\nencourage refilling of ICS prescriptions, and increase com -\\nmunication with providers. Adherence was tracked during \\n10 weeks using objective measures that included either elec -\\ntronic monitors or the calculation of canister weight. Subjects \\ncompleted both quality of life and asthma control surveys. \\nAdherence was 32% higher in the IVR group but there was \\nno difference in quality of life or asthma control.\\nWeinstein and colleagues have designed an asthma adher -\\nence disease management model that was developed while \\ncaring for children with severe asthma.55 It consists of four \\nsequential steps when evaluating symptomatic patients: (1) \\nobjective measure of medication use, (2) increase medica -\\ntion if adherent and identify patient barriers if nonadherent, \\n(3) select appropriate interventions for specific barriers, and \\n(4) use appropriate patient-centered communication tech -\\nniques (Figure 14.1). The same investigators have developed \\na web-based asthma adherence clinical decision support sys -\\ntem to promote adherence to asthma treatments.56 Patients \\nidentify barriers to treatment and receive written and video \\nresponses to each barrier. Providers review the barriers and \\nare given specific recommendations for these patients as well \\nas patient-centered counseling techniques to achieve optimal \\nadherence (Table 14.2). This system is being tested telephoni -\\ncally by clinicians trained in the MI technique who provide \\ninterventions to subjects with remote electronic adherence \\nmonitors and pulmonary function devices.57SUMMARY\\nThe case report presented demonstrates how the adherence \\ninformation presented in the chapter should be used clinically. \\nThe patient reports that she is following the treatment plan, \\nbut both biological assay and pharmacy data reveal otherwise. \\nThe principal barriers and health beliefs identified include \\ncost of medications, concern about medication side effects, \\nand questions about whether treatment is really necessary. \\nThe secondary barriers identified include disagreement with \\nspouse about treatment and forgetting to take treatment. The \\nAsthma Information Test revealed that the patient questions \\nthe need for an ICS and does not understand the rationale for \\ntreatment. The physician increases the strength of the asthma \\ntreatment thereby decreasing the total number of medications \\n(complexity of care) and the number of co-payments.\\nThe NP uses patient-centered communication skills by \\nasking the patient what she would like to learn from the \\nasthma education class. She addresses the patient’s con -\\ncern by developing a strategy to test her health belief about \\nthe need for asthma medication and determine whether she \\nneeds a daily anti-inflammatory treatment. A strategy to \\nhelp the patient answer this question is developed. Electronic \\nadherence monitoring gives clinicians information to review \\nwith patients and come to an agreement regarding the need \\nfor medication and its short-term and long-term efficacy.\\nREFERENCES\\n 1.

A 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of \\nasthma presented for lung function testing. He \\nreported shortness of breath and the lack of effect \\nof his therapy, and he particularly mentioned that \\nhe had no symptomatic relief after inhaling sal -\\nbutamol via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler \\n(pMDI). He said he had been given the inhaler for \\nthe first time 2 weeks earlier at an internist’s clinic \\nand he had received only a brief oral instruction to \\n“spray the medicine to the throat.” As a result, he \\nhad faithfully administered the drugs by aiming and \\nfiring the aerosol toward his anterior neck around \\nthe thyroid cartilage twice a day for 2 weeks.\\n 2. A 45-year-old female asthma patient reported that \\nher beta-agonist pMDI inhaler was ineffective. She \\nhad increased the dose of her beta-agonist to 20 \\npuffs a day without any obvious benefit. She insisted \\nthat she knew how to use the inhaler correctly and \\nhad been following the verbal instructions given \\nby her general physician some months earlier. \\nWhen she was asked to demonstrate her inhaler \\ntechnique, she fired the aerosol twice with the dust \\ncap on, then quickly removed the cap, placed the \\nmouthpiece between her lips, and inhaled.\\ncoMMent\\nThese two unusual cases should remind medical personnel \\nnot to rely on quick verbal instructions to patients on inhaler \\ntechnique; rather, they should first demonstrate the correct \\nuse of an inhaler and then observe the patient’s technique. Furthermore, one should not assume that patients with a \\nlong history of using MDIs are able to use inhalers correctly. \\nThe absence of any effect, therapeutic or adverse, of a beta-\\nagonist MDI, especially in patients receiving higher doses, \\nshould alert physicians to the possibility of misuse due to \\ninadequate instructions or demonstration.\\nINTRODUCTION AND CASE STUDIES\\nThe incidence of asthma continues to rise worldwide, dou -\\nbling over the last 10 years1–3; consequently, asthma is placing \\na huge economic burden on health-care resources.4 Asthma \\nmanagement guidelines are now widely available in virtually \\nevery country. Their aim is to achieve control of the disease \\nwith the lowest possible dose of the medication prescribed.1 \\nAsthma guidelines advocate a stepwise approach to pharma -\\ncological treatment: increase the amount and frequency of \\nmedication as asthma worsens (“step up”), and decrease the \\namount and frequency of medication when asthma is under \\ncontrol (“step down”). Once the control of asthma has been \\nachieved and maintained for at least 3 months, a gradual \\nreduction of the maintenance therapy is recommended to \\nidentify the minimum therapy required to maintain control.1\\nUnfortunately, the current level of asthma control falls \\nfar short of the published goals for long-term asthma man -\\nagement,2 with many patients reporting daytime and night -\\ntime symptoms at least once a week, continuing to require \\nunscheduled GP visits and hospitalizations.2 One of the rea -\\nsons why asthma remains poorly controlled is that patients \\nare deriving incomplete benefit from their inhaled medica -\\ntion, primarily because they are unable to use their inhalers \\ncorrectly.5 Although inhaler misuse for pMDIs is commonly 15Inhaler Devices\\nFederico Lavorini, Mark L.

Thus, the choice of the right \\ninhaler for the patient is just as important as choosing the \\nmost effective medication.\\nIn this chapter, we will focus on the handheld inhalers (i.e., \\npMDI, DPI, BA pMDI, and SMI), together with the current \\nunderstanding of the correct inhalation techniques for each \\ndevice. We will also provide a general description of nebu -\\nlizers, which are frequently used to deliver asthma medica -\\ntions.8 However, since most of the current nebulizer designs \\nare bulky and inconvenient, and drug administration is pro -\\nlonged, they are better categorized as second-line devices for \\nmost asthma patients.

They are still the \\nmost widely prescribed inhalers for the treatment of asthma \\nand chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.8 The pMDI is \\na portable multidose device that utilizes a propellant under \\npressure to generate a metered dose of an aerosol through \\nan atomization nozzle (Figure 15.1). Until recently, pMDIs \\nused chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) as propellants to deliver \\ndrugs; however, in accordance with the Montreal Protocol of \\n1987, CFC propellants have, in most cases, been replaced by \\nhydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellants that do not have ozone-\\ndepleting properties.9 The key components of the CFC-\\ndriven pMDIs (i.e., canister, metering valve, actuator, and \\npropellant) have been retained in the HFA-driven pMDIs, but \\nsome of the elements required redesigning. Two approaches \\nwere used in the formulation of HFA-driven pMDIs. The first approach was to show its equivalence with the CFC-driven \\npMDI, which was necessary for regulatory approval; this was \\nused for salbutamol pMDIs and some of the corticosteroid \\npMDIs. Some HFA formulations were matched to their CFC \\ncounterparts on a microgram for microgram basis; therefore, \\nno dosage modification was needed when switching from a \\nCFC to a HFA formulation. The second approach involved \\nextensive changes, particularly for corticosteroid inhalers \\ncontaining beclomethasone dipropionate, and resulted in \\nthe development of solution aerosols with extra-fine particle \\nsize distributions and high lung deposition.10,11 The exact \\ndose equivalence of extra-fine HFA beclomethasone dipro -\\npionate and CFC beclomethasone dipropionate has not been \\nestablished, but data from most trials have indicated a 2:1 \\ndose ratio in favor of the HFA-driven pMDI.10,11 Patients \\non regular long-term treatment with a CFC pMDI could be \\nsafely switched to a HFA pMDI without any deterioration in \\ntheir pulmonary function, loss of disease control, increased \\nfrequency of hospital admissions, or other adverse effects.9 \\nHowever, when physicians prescribe HFA formulations \\nin place of the CFC versions for the first time, they should \\nValve\\nstem oriﬁc eValve\\nstem groove\\n(a) (b) (c)Spra y oriﬁcePressing the stem\\ndisconne cts the metering chamb erDischarge of the dose\\nfrom the metering chamb erMetering of\\na single doseActuator\\nnozzleMetering\\nvalveActuator\\nsealsContainer\\nActive dr ug\\nProp ellants\\nCosolven tsComp onen ts Formulation\\nFIGURE 15.1  (See color insert)  Schematic representation of the components of a pressurized metered-dose inhaler.

Two of the major differences between the CFC and \\nHFA pMDIs are that the plume released from many HFA-\\ndriven pMDIs has a slower velocity and it is warmer.6 These \\nchanges partially overcome the cold Freon effect5 that has \\ncaused some patients to suddenly stop while in the process of \\ninhaling their CFC pMDIs. Another difference is that many \\nHFA-driven pMDIs contain a small amount of ethanol. This \\naffects the taste, as well as further increasing the temperature \\nand decreasing the velocity of the aerosol.\\nDespite the numerous advantages of pMDIs, most patients \\ncannot use these inhalers correctly, even after repeated \\ninstruction (see Table 15.1).5 This is because pMDIs require \\ngood coordination between the patient’s inspiration and the \\ntiming of the device actuation to ensure the correct inhala -\\ntion and deposition of the drug into the lungs. When using \\npMDIs, the correct inhalation technique involves firing the \\npMDI while breathing in deeply and slowly, continuing \\nto inhale after firing, and then following inhalation with a \\nbreath-holding pause to allow particles to sediment on the \\nairways.12 The patient should also be instructed that, when \\nused for the first time, and after several days of not using, \\nthe pMDI should be primed by actuating it before inhala -\\ntion. Interestingly, patients frequently fail to continuously \\ninhale slowly after activation of the inhaler and exhale fully \\nbefore inhalation.5,13 In addition, patients often get the timing \\nwrong by activating the inhaler before inhalation, at the end \\nof inhalation, or by initiating inhaler actuation while breath-\\nholding.5,13 Crompton et al.7,13,14 showed that the propor -\\ntion of patients capable of using their pMDI correctly after \\nreading the package insert fell from 46% in 1982 to 21% in \\n2000, while only just over one-half of patients (52%) used a \\npMDI correctly even after receiving instruction. In a large \\n(n = 4078) study, 71% of the patients were found to have dif -\\nficulty using pMDIs, and almost one-half of them had poor \\ncoordination.15 More importantly, an incorrect inhalation \\ntechnique has been associated with poor asthma control.13 \\nThe incorrect use of pMDIs is not confined to patients; both \\nnurses and physicians also use pMDIs incorrectly.5\\nEven with the correct inhalation technique, pMDIs are \\ninefficient since no more than 20% for CFC pMDIs5 or 40% \\nfor HFA pMDIs producing extra-fine particles10,11 of the \\nemitted dose reaches the lungs, with a high proportion of the \\ndrug being deposited in the mouth and oropharynx, which \\ncan cause local as well as systemic side effects due to rapid \\nabsorption.5,6pMdI accessory  devIces: spacers  \\nand\\xa0valved  holdIng chaMbers\\nSpacer devices are attachments to the pMDI mouthpiece with \\nvolumes ranging from 50 to 800 mL (Figure 15.2). Many have \\na one-way valve that prevents the patient blowing the dose \\naway after firing.16 Spacers assist the patient to inhale without \\nnecessarily having to coordinate this with actuation of the \\ndevice.16 By acting as an aerosol reservoir, these devices slow \\nthe aerosol velocity and increase the transit time and distance \\nbetween the pMDI actuator and the patient’s mouth, allow -\\ning the particle size to decrease, with a consequent increased \\ndeposition of the aerosol particles in the lungs.16 Moreover, \\nbecause spacers trap large particles comprising up to 80% of \\nthe aerosol dose, only a small fraction of the dose is deposited \\nin the oropharynx, thereby reducing the side effects, such as \\nthroat irritation, dysphonia, and oral candidiasis, associated \\nwith medications delivered by the pMDI alone.16 There are \\nthree basic spacers designs: the open tube, the holding cham -\\nber, and the reverse flow design, in which the pMDI, placed \\nclose to the mouth, is fired in the direction away from the \\npatient. A valved holding chamber fitted with an appropriate \\nface mask is used to give pMDI drugs to neonates, young \\nchildren, and elderly patients. The two key factors for opti -\\nmum aerosol delivery are a tight but comfortable face mask \\nfit and a reduced face mask dead space.16 Because children \\nhave low tidal volumes and inspiratory flow rates, comfort -\\nable breathing through a face mask requires low-resistance \\ninspiratory or expiratory valves. Of note, some spacers \\nincorporate a whistle that makes a sound if inspiration is too \\nfast; this feedback enables patients to improve drug delivery \\nthrough optimizing their inhalation technique. There is evi -\\ndence that spacers may improve the clinical effect of inhaled \\nmedications especially in patients who are unable to use a \\npMDI properly.16 Indeed, spacers may increase the response \\nto short-acting beta-adrenergic bronchodilators, even in \\npatients with a correct inhalation technique.17–20 While spac -\\ners are good drug-delivery devices, they suffer from the \\nobvious disadvantage of making the entire delivery system \\nless portable and compact than a pMDI alone. The size \\nand the appearance of some spacers may detract from the \\nappeal of the pMDI to patients, especially among the pediat -\\nric population, and negatively affect patients’ compliance.16 \\nFurthermore, spacers may contribute to the inconsistent \\ndelivery of medication due to electrostatic charge, resulting \\nin a buildup of drug deposits on the spacer wall.16 Aerosols \\n(a) (b) (c)\\nFIGURE 15.2  (See color insert)  Examples of an open tube spacer (a: the Jet), a holding chamber (b: the AeroChamber Plus), and a reverse-\\nflow spacer (c: the InspirEase).', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 172}),\n"," Document(page_content='155 Inhaler Devices\\nremain suspended for longer periods within holding cham -\\nbers that are manufactured from nonelectrostatic materials \\ncompared with other materials. Thus, an inhalation might be \\ndelayed for 2–5 sec without substantial loss of the drug to the \\nwalls of metal or nonstatic spacers.16 The electrostatic charge \\nin plastic spacers can be substantially reduced by washing \\nthe spacer with a low concentration of dishwashing liquid \\nand allowing it to drip dry rather than towel drying it. There \\nis no consensus on how often a spacer should be cleaned, but \\nrecommendations range in general from once a week to once \\na month, and patients should be directed to the manufactur -\\ners’ instructions.6 The proportion of the drug dose that the \\npatient inhales may vary greatly with different spacers, and \\nthe data about a spacer derived from studies with one drug \\nand pMDI may not apply to other drugs.16\\nBREATH-ACTUATED pMDIs\\nBA pMDIs, such as the Autohaler and Easibreathe, are alter -\\nnatives to standard pMDIs that have been developed to over -\\ncome the problem of poor coordination of pMDI actuation \\nand inhalation.21 BA pMDIs have a flow-triggered system \\ndriven by a spring that releases the dose during inhalation, \\nso that firing and inhaling are automatically coordinated.21 \\nThese inhalation devices can achieve good lung deposition \\nand clinical efficacy in patients unable to use a pMDI cor -\\nrectly because of coordination difficulties.22 Errors when \\nusing a BA pMDI are less frequent than when using a stan -\\ndard pMDI.7 An increased use of BA pMDIs might improve \\nasthma control and reduce the overall cost of asthma therapy \\ncompared with conventional pMDIs.23 On the negative side, \\nBA pMDIs do not solve the cold Freon effect and would be unsuitable for a patient who has this kind of difficulty using \\na pMDI. In addition, in order to trigger an actuation, these \\ndevices require a relatively higher inspiratory flow than \\npMDIs. Furthermore, oropharyngeal deposition with BA \\npMDIs is as high as that observed with CFC pMDIs.\\nDRY POWDER INHALERS\\nDPIs were first introduced in 1970, the earliest being single-\\ndose devices containing the powder formulation in a gelatine \\ncapsule, which the patient loaded into the device prior to use. \\nSince the late 1980s, multidose DPIs have been available, pro -\\nviding the same degree of convenience as a pMDI.24 These \\ndevices have been further modified for the treatment of asthma \\nand other conditions by delivering a range of drugs that are \\nusually given by injection, such as peptides, proteins, and vac -\\ncines. The use of DPIs is expected to increase following the \\nphasing out of CFC production along with the increased avail -\\nability of dry powder inhalers and the development of novel \\npowder devices.25 DPI doses can be premetered in the form of \\nsingle capsules or foil blisters or as multi-single unit dose disks \\n(Figure 15.3); alternatively, device metering of bulk powder \\ncan be achieved through the use of reservoir devices.24,25\\nGenerally, DPIs have many advantages over pMDIs. DPIs \\nare actuated and driven by the patient’s inspiratory flow; con -\\nsequently, DPIs do not require propellants to generate the aero -\\nsol, removing the need to coordinate inhaler actuation with \\ninhalation.26 However, a forceful and deep inhalation through \\nthe DPI is needed to deaggregate the powder formulation into \\nrespirable-sized particles as efficiently as possible and, conse -\\nquently, to ensure that the drug is delivered to the lungs.26,27 \\nAlthough most patients are capable of generating enough flow \\nNonreusable\\npowder inhalersPowder inhalers\\n(activat ed by breathing)\\nReusable\\npowder inhalers\\nMultiple-dose\\nsystemsSingle-dose\\nsystemsSingle-dose\\nsystems\\nDiskus\\n60 SD 200 SD 200 SDUsable fo r:50 SD 3 month s1  year\\nSD = single doseTurbuhaler Easyhaler Aerolizer Rotadisk NovolizerMultiple-dose\\nsystems\\nFIGURE 15.3  (See color insert)  A variety of dry powder inhalers.

In addition, the \\ninhalation maneuver has to be repeated until the capsule is \\nempty, which may give rise to underdosing and high-dose \\nvariability. Other DPIs are multiple unit dose devices, such \\nas the Diskhaler, or multidose devices, such as the Diskus \\nand the Turbuhaler. These devices do not have any trigger -\\ning mechanism, which makes optimal drug delivery entirely \\ndependent on an individual patient’s inspiratory maneuver. \\nBecause of variations in the design and performance of \\nDPIs, patients might not use all DPIs equally well; therefore, \\ndifferent types of DPIs might not be readily interchange -\\nable, despite dispensing the same drug.27 Studies have also \\nshown that the dose emission is reduced when some DPIs are \\nexposed to extremely low and high temperatures and humid -\\nity25,26; therefore, DPIs should be stored in a cool dry place.\\nA recent systematic literature review revealed that up to \\n90% of patients did not use their DPI correctly.29 Common \\nerrors made by patients included lack of exhalation before \\ninhalation, incorrect positioning and loading of the inhaler, \\nfailure to inhale forcefully and deeply through the device, and \\npatients’ failure to breath-hold after inhalation.29 All these \\nerrors may lead to insufficient drug delivery, which adversely \\ninfluences drug efficacy and may contribute to inadequate dis -\\nease control.29 It is not surprising that such a high proportion of \\npatients were unable to use DPIs correctly as the devices have \\nmany inherent design limitations. The Diskhaler, for example, \\nis a multiple unit dose device as it contains a series of foil blis -\\nters on a disk. It is complicated to use, requiring eight steps to effect one correct inhalation; approximately 70% of patients \\nare unable to use it correctly.29 The disks have to be changed \\nfrequently and the device has to be cleaned before refilling. In \\naddition, it provides no feedback to the patient of a success -\\nful inhalation, except a sweet taste in the mouth, which may \\nsimply be indicative of oral drug deposition. The Turbuhaler, \\na multidose reservoir device, is the most frequently prescribed \\nDPI as it produces a good deposition of the drug in the lungs \\nprovided that a sufficient (about 60 L/min) inspiratory flow has \\nbeen achieved by the patient. However, approximately 80% \\nof patients are unable to use it correctly29; common mistakes \\nmade by patients using this inhaler are failure to rotate the base \\nfully in both directions, and failure to keep the device upright \\nuntil loaded. In addition, due to its high intrinsic resistance, \\npatients who have a reduced inspiratory flow may encoun -\\nter problems using this device. The Diskus (or Accuhaler) is \\nanother example of a multidose device that uses a foil blister \\nstrip. Up to 50% of patients use this DPI incorrectly. Common \\nerrors include failure or difficulty in loading the device before \\ninhalation, and exhaling into the device.29 The Diskus has a \\nlow intrinsic resistance but, like the Turbuhaler, it does not \\nhave any triggering mechanism, which makes optimal drug \\ndelivery entirely dependent on an individual patient’s forceful \\ninspiratory maneuver.29 Additionally, as with other DPI devices \\nemploying drug blisters, incomplete emptying of the metered \\ndose may occur, which could reduce the amount of drug deliv -\\nered to the lungs and hence reduce its clinical efficacy.29\\nsoft MIst Inhalers\\nThe development of SMIs has opened up new opportunities for \\ninhaled drug delivery. These inhalation devices use liquid for -\\nmulations similar to those in nebulizers, but they are generally \\nmultidose devices that have the potential to compete with pMDIs \\nand DPIs in the portable inhaler market. Currently, the only SMI \\nmarketed in some European countries is the Respimat inhaler. \\nThis device does not require propellants since it is powered by \\nthe energy of a compressed spring inside the inhaler. Individual \\ndoses are delivered via a precisely engineered nozzle system \\nas a slow-moving aerosol cloud (hence the term soft mist ).30 \\nScintigraphic studies have shown that lung deposition is higher \\n(up to 50%) than that from a CFC-based pMDI.30 Although \\nthe Respimat has been used relatively little in clinical practice \\nto date, clinical trials seem to confirm that drugs delivered by \\nthe Respimat are effective in correspondingly smaller doses in \\npatients with obstructive airway disease.31 The Respimat is a \\n“press and breathe” device, and the correct inhalation technique \\nclosely resembles that used with a pMDI. However, although \\ncoordination between firing and inhaling is required, the low \\nspray velocity and the long duration of the aerosol cloud (typi -\\ncally 1–1.5 sec) could enable patients to coordinate firing and \\ninhaling more easily than with a pMDI.30\\nnebul Izers\\nVarious types of nebulizers are available, and several stud -\\nies have indicated that their performance varies between ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 174}),\n"," Document(page_content='157 Inhaler Devices\\nmanufacturers and also between nebulizers from the same \\nmanufacturer.32–34 There are two basic types of nebulizers: \\nthe pneumatic or jet nebulizer, and the ultrasonic nebulizer \\n(Figure 15.4).32–34\\nThe jet nebulizer generates aerosol particles as a result of \\nthe impact between a liquid and a jet of high-velocity gas (usu -\\nally air or oxygen) in the nebulizer chamber. In a jet nebulizer, \\nthe driving gas passes through a very narrow opening from a \\nhigh-pressure system. This driving gas passes at high velocity \\nover the end of a narrow liquid feed tube or concentric feed -\\ning system creating a negative pressure. As a result of this fall \\nin pressure, the liquid is sucked up by the Bernoulli effect \\nand is broken into small droplets. The majority of the liquid \\nmass produced during this process is in the form of large (15–\\n500 μm) nonrespirable droplets; coarse droplets impact on the \\nbaffles of the nebulizer while smaller droplets may be inhaled \\nor may land on the internal walls of the nebulizer, return -\\ning to the reservoir for renebulization.32–34 The impaction of \\nthe large particles generates small, respirable particles, and \\ntherefore the baffle design has a critical effect on the droplet \\nsize. Concentric liquid feeds minimize blockage by residual \\ndrug buildup with repeated nebulization. A flat pick-up plate \\nmay allow some nebulizers to be tilted during treatment while \\nmaintaining the liquid flow from the reservoir. There are four \\ndifferent designs of jet nebulizers: a jet nebulizer with a res -\\nervoir tube, a jet nebulizer with a collection bag, a breath-\\nenhanced jet nebulizer, and a BA jet nebulizer.32–34 Both the \\nbreath-enhanced and the BA jet nebulizers are modifications \\nof the “conventional” jet nebulizers specifically designed to \\nimprove their efficiency by increasing the amount of aerosol \\ndelivered to the patient with less wastage of the aerosol dur -\\ning exhalation. Different types of jet nebulizers have differ -\\nent output characteristics that are determined by the design \\nof the air jet and the capillary tube orifices, their geometric \\nrelationship with each other, and the internal baffles; for a \\ngiven design, the major determinant of the output is the driv -\\ning pressure of gas (air or oxygen). The jet nebulizer with a \\nreservoir tube provides continuous aerosolization during the \\nentire breathing cycle, causing the release and wastage of the \\naerosol into the air during exhalation and anytime when the patient is not breathing. Consequently, no more than 20% of \\nthe emitted aerosol is inhaled.32–34 The jet nebulizer with a \\ncollection bag generates the aerosol by continuously filling \\na collection bag that acts as a reservoir. The patient inhales \\nthe aerosol from the reservoir through a one-way inspiratory \\nvalve and exhales to the environment through an exhalation \\nport between the one-way inspiratory valve and the mouth -\\npiece. The breath-enhanced jet nebulizer (e.g., the PARI LC \\nPlus) uses two one-way valves to prevent the loss of the aero -\\nsol to the environment; when the patient inhales, the inspira -\\ntory valve opens and the aerosol vents through the nebulizer; \\nthe exhaled aerosol passes through an expiratory valve in the \\nmouthpiece. BA jet nebulizers are designed to increase the \\naerosol delivery to the patient by means of a BA valve that \\ntriggers aerosol generation only during inspiration. Both the \\nbreath-enhanced and BA nebulizers increase the amount of \\ninspired aerosol with a shorter nebulization time than “con -\\nventional” jet nebulizers.32\\nUltrasonic nebulizers use a rapidly vibrating ( >1 MHz) \\npiezoelectric crystal to produce aerosol particles.32–34 High-\\nfrequency ultrasonic waves induce vibrations from the crys -\\ntal, which are transmitted to the surface of the drug solution \\nwhere droplets break free from the crest of these waves and \\nare released as an aerosol. The size of the droplets produced \\nby an ultrasonic nebulizer is related to the frequency of the \\noscillation.32–34 Although ultrasonic nebulizers can nebulize \\nsolutions more quickly than jet nebulizers, they are not suit -\\nable for suspensions and the piezoelectric crystal may heat \\nthe drug to be aerosolized. Vibrating mesh nebulizers are a \\nrelatively new form of ultrasonic nebulizer.6 These nebuliz -\\ners use electricity to create an aerosol by actively vibrating \\nan aperture plate to pump liquid through funnel-shaped aper -\\ntures or using an ultrasonic horn to push liquid through an \\naperture plate.6 Vibrating mesh nebulizers have a number of \\nadvantages over the classic ultrasonic nebulizer systems: they \\nare efficient, quiet, and generally portable. However, they are \\nalso significantly more expensive than other types of nebu -\\nlizers, and require a significant amount of maintenance and \\ncleaning after each use to prevent a buildup of deposits and a \\nblockage of the apertures.6\\nBaﬄeVenturi\\nLiquid in\\nreservoir\\nCompresse d gas\\nsource (a) (b)Capillar y tub ePatien t\\ninterface\\nAmbien t\\nairAmbien t\\nair\\nDrug\\nsolution\\nPower\\ntransmitte rMistPatien t\\ninterface\\nAcoustic w aves\\nPiezo electric\\ncrystal\\nFIGURE 15.4  Schematic illustrations of the components of a jet nebulizer (a) and an ultrasonic nebulizer (b).

However, nebu -\\nlizers have some distinct disadvantages. Patients must load \\nthe device with the medication solution for each treatment, \\nand bacterial contamination of the reservoir can cause respi -\\nratory infections,6,32–34 making regular cleaning important. \\nAlso, nebulizer treatments take longer than pMDIs and DPIs \\nto administer (10–15 min for a jet nebulizer, 5 min for an \\nultrasonic or mesh nebulizer). Although they are relatively \\nportable, a typical jet nebulizer must be plugged into a wall \\noutlet or a power adaptor, and thus cannot be used easily in \\ntransit. Newer nebulizer designs have enhanced patients’ \\nconvenience. Ultrasonic and vibrating mesh nebulizers are \\nquieter and more efficient at generating an aerosol6 and short -\\nening treatment times. In addition, they do not require a com -\\npressor, making them lighter in weight, battery powered, and \\neasier to use on the go.\\nCHOICE OF AN INHALER DEVICE \\nFOR ASTHMA THERAPY\\nMore than 100 inhaled device–drug combinations are cur -\\nrently available for the treatment of asthma patients.35 The \\nnumber is likely to increase with the development of generic \\ninhaled drugs delivered by relatively low-cost pMDIs and \\nDPIs. Consequently, the level of confusion experienced by \\nclinicians, nurses, and pharmacists when trying to choose the \\nmost appropriate device for each patient is increased. Thus, \\nphysicians’ experience is among the most important fac -\\ntors that influence decision making in the choice of inhaler \\nin asthma therapy. In fact, inhalers are often prescribed on \\nan empirical basis rather than an evidence-based approach. \\nFollowing their own experience, doctors are much more \\nlikely to prescribe the same old inhaler that they have always \\nprescribed rather than new, improved inhaler devices.\\nAsthma management guidelines provide guidance for pre -\\nscribing inhalers to children; however, this is not the case \\nfor adult patients. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) \\nguidelines1 recommend pMDIs with a spacer and a face mask \\nfor children younger than 4 years (or pMDIs with a spacer \\nand a mouthpiece for those aged 4–6 years) and, in addi -\\ntion to pMDIs alone, DPIs or BA pMDIs for children older \\nthan 6 years. However, for adults, the same guidelines state \\nthat inhalers should be portable and simple to use, should \\nnot require an external power source, require minimal coop -\\neration and coordination, and have minimal maintenance \\nrequirements.1 The British Thoracic Society guidelines36 also \\ninclude the patient’s preference and ability to use the device \\ncorrectly. However, the advice relating to patient preference \\nis not supported by scientific evidence that patients will cor -\\nrectly use their preferred inhaler.\\nThe criteria to be considered when choosing an inhaler \\ndevice differ depending on the audience being addressed.37 From the viewpoint of the respiratory therapist, consis -\\ntent and safe dosing, sufficient drug deposition, and clini -\\ncal effect guide the inhaler choice. The patient’s ability to \\ninhale through the device, the intrinsic airflow resistance \\nof the device, and the degree of dependence of the drug \\nrelease on inspiratory airflow variability are all important \\ndeterminants when considering the constancy of dosing.37 \\nFrom the point of view of the clinician, clinical efficacy \\nand safety should take precedence when choosing an \\ninhaler.37 However, in the real world, clinical efficacy must \\nbe balanced against cost effectiveness, and inhalers with an \\ninsufficient performance may be prescribed simply because \\nthey are cheap. Patients’ preferences and acceptance of the \\ninhaler should also be considered when deciding on a spe -\\ncific inhaler, since these will have major implications for \\ncompliance.\\nSeveral general principles of inhaler selection and use have \\nbeen reviewed in detail by a joint committee of the American \\nCollege of Chest Physicians and the American College of \\nAsthma, Allergy and Immunology.38 These guidelines con -\\nclude that pMDIs are convenient for delivering a wide variety \\nof drugs to a broad spectrum of patients. For patients who \\nhave trouble coordinating inhalation with inhaler actuation, \\nthe use of spacers may obviate this difficulty, though most \\nof these devices are cumbersome to store and transport.38 \\nThe use of a spacer, however, is mandatory for infants and \\nyoung children. DPIs are usually easier for patients to handle \\nthan pMDIs and a growing number of drug types are avail -\\nable in several DPI formats.38 The key issue for dry powder \\ninhalation is the minimum inspiratory flow rate below which \\ndeagglomeration is inefficient, resulting in a reduced drug \\ndelivered dose. The most ill patients and the very young may \\nnot be candidates for a DPI. A nebulizer could be used as an \\nadequate alternative to a pMDI with a spacer by almost any \\npatient in a variety of clinical settings from the home to the \\nintensive care unit. However, nebulizers are more expensive, \\ncumbersome, and relatively time consuming to use compared \\nwith handheld inhalers. These attributes should limit the \\nuse of nebulizers whose effect can be matched by handheld \\ndevices in almost all clinical settings.\\nRecently, Chapman and coworkers39 proposed an algo -\\nrithm approach to inhaler selection that considers the \\npatient’s ability to generate an inspiratory flow rate >30 L/\\nmin, to coordinate inhaler actuation and inspiration, and to \\nprepare and actuate the device (Table 15.2).\\nWhen choosing an inhaler for children, it is essential that \\nthe individual child receives the appropriate instructions \\nand training necessary for the management of the disease.40 \\nFurthermore, the child should be prescribed the correct \\nmedication tailored to the severity of their disease and, most \\nimportantly, the prescribed inhaler should suit the individual \\nneeds and preference of the child.40 Contrary to general opin -\\nion, using an inhaler may be difficult for children40; many \\nchildren with asthma use their inhaler incorrectly, which \\nmay result in unreliable drug delivery, even after instruc -\\ntion and training for correct inhalation. In addition, previous \\ninhalation instruction may be forgotten; therefore, training ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 176}),\n"," Document(page_content='159 Inhaler Devices\\nshould be repeated regularly to maintain the correct inhala -\\ntion technique in children with asthma.40\\nADMIT RECOMMENDATIONS\\nMany physicians in Europe are fully aware of the difficulties \\nthat patients have using prescribed inhaler devices correctly \\nand the negative impact that this may have on asthma control. \\nADMIT,35 a consortium of European respiratory physicians \\nwith a common interest in promoting the excellent delivery \\nof inhaled drugs, was formed with the goal to examine ways \\nof improving the treatment of asthma and chronic obstruc -\\ntive pulmonary disease in Europe, with specific reference to \\ninhalers. ADMIT has made a number of recommendations \\nrelated to the delivery instructions for a correct inhalation \\ntechnique for each inhaler device. These evidence-based rec -\\nommendations are summarized in Table 15.3.\\nADMIT35 has also proposed a practical algorithm in order \\nto improve the instruction given to patients regarding the \\noptimal use of their inhalers (Figure\\xa015.5). At each consulta -\\ntion, the physician should establish the patient’s current level \\nof symptoms and control, ideally using a composite measure \\nsuch as the GINA control assessment or the Asthma Control \\nTest,1 and if the patient’s asthma is well controlled for at least \\n3 months, therapy should be stepped down gradually accord -\\ning to the treatment guidelines. Conversely, if the patient \\nanswers “no” to any of these checklist questions, then com -\\npliance and aggravating (trigger) factors should be assessed. \\nMost importantly, the patient’s inhalation technique should \\nbe assessed. If the patient is unable to use a particular inhaler \\ncorrectly despite repeated attempts, a change in inhaler \\ndevice should be considered. In the cases where ongoing, \\nuncontrolled asthma persists in the face of a correct inhaler \\ntechnique, then asthma therapy should be stepped up accord -\\ning to the treatment guidelines and another appointment \\nscheduled in order to recheck the symptoms.CONCLUSIONS\\nThe prevalence of asthma continues to rise throughout the \\nworld, particularly among children. Despite the publication of \\nboth national and international guidelines and the widespread \\navailability of effective pharmacological therapy, asthma is \\nfrequently uncontrolled, and still causes death. There are a \\nnumber of reasons for this anomalous situation. First, the \\nguidelines are complex and too long for most physicians to \\nabsorb and implement. Second, patients frequently do not \\nadhere to their treatment regimen for a variety of reasons \\nincluding incorrect use of their inhaler and underestimation \\nof the severity of their disease. In addition, asthma severity \\nis often misclassified, leading to inappropriate or insufficient \\nprescribed therapy. Finally, although the guidelines agree on \\nthe most appropriate therapy to control asthma, the method \\nby which this therapy is delivered to the lungs often lacks suf -\\nficient detail.TABLE 15.2\\nSuitability of Inhaler Devices According to the Patient’s \\nInspiratory Flow Rate and Ability to Coordinate Inhaler \\nActuation and Inhalation\\nGood Hand–Lung Coordination Poor Hand–Lung Coordination\\nInspiratory \\nFlow >30 L/minInspiratory \\nFlow <30 L/minInspiratory \\nFlow >30 L/minInspiratory \\nFlow <30 L/min\\npMDI pMDI pMDI + spacer pMDI + spacer\\nBA pMDI Nebulizer BA pMDI Nebulizer\\nDPI SMI DPI SMI\\nNebulizer Nebulizer\\nSMI SMI\\nSource:  Modified from Chapman, K.R., V oshaar, T.H., Virchow, J.C., Eur. \\nRespir.

Those patients with severe airflow obstruction, children, and the \\nelderly would benefit from an inhaler device with a low airflow \\nresistance.\\n• Before prescribing a DPI, check that the patient can inhale deeply and \\nforcibly at the start of the inhalation maneuver because the airflow \\nprofile affects the particle size produced and hence drug deposition \\nand efficacy.\\n• Where possible, one patient should have one type of inhaler.\\n• Establish an official board to compile instructions for the correct \\ninhalation technique for each inhaler device currently on the market.\\n• Instructions for correct inhaler use should be made readily accessible \\non a dedicated website.\\n• Training in the correct inhalation technique is essential for patients and \\nhealth-care professionals.\\n• Inhalation techniques should be checked and reinforced at regular \\nintervals.\\n• Teaching correct inhalation techniques should be tailored to the \\npatient’s needs and preferences: group instruction in correct inhalation \\ntechniques appears to be more effective than personal one-to-one \\ninstruction and equally as effective as video instruction; younger \\npatients may benefit more from multimedia teaching methods; elderly \\npatients respond well to one-to-one tuition.\\nSource:  Modified from Crompton, G.K., Barnes, P.J., Broeders, M., et al., \\nRespir.

In the past 10–15 years, \\nseveral innovative developments have advanced the field of \\ninhaler design. There are many choices in all device cat -\\negories that incorporate features providing efficient aerosol \\ndelivery to treat obstructive airway diseases. The problems \\nwith drug delivery have been identified due to the inappropri -\\nate use of inhaler devices, particularly pMDIs where patients \\nneed to coordinate inhaler activation with inspiration. There \\nis clearly a need to develop inhaler devices that are easy to \\nuse and capable of delivering consistent doses of drugs to the \\nlungs, which may in turn improve patient compliance with \\ntreatment, leading to better asthma control.\\nThe continued and repeated education of both health-care \\nprofessionals and patients regarding the correct inhalation \\ntechnique is essential, with reassessment at regular inter -\\nvals. Substantial changes in educational efforts are clearly \\nrequired and should be particularly addressed toward the \\ngeneral practitioner and the asthma nurse who are usually \\ncharged with teaching patients how to use their inhaler cor -\\nrectly. Finally, it is important to remember that continually \\nchanging inhaler devices that deliver the same drug is not the \\nanswer, as patients lose confidence in both the device and the \\ndrug, and compliance with therapy drops. An inhaler should \\nonly be prescribed with the absolute certainty that the patient \\ncan use it correctly.\\nREFERENCES\\n 1. Global Initiative for Asthma.

Importantly, \\nthe patient perceives her condition as well controlled despite \\nfrequent symptoms and the need for daily reliever medica -\\ntion, which from a medical perspective are features of poorly \\ncontrolled asthma. Furthermore, the patient is not taking a \\nregular preventer medication, she has suffered from a recent exacerbation, has low lung function, and is a smoker, all of \\nwhich lead to an increased likelihood of future exacerbations. \\nThis future risk is another important component of the assess -\\nment of the patient’s asthma control. Finally, there are other \\nissues that will also need to be addressed as part of the assess -\\nment of her asthma control, including her increasing weight \\nand her sedentary lifestyle. Obese patients with asthma may \\nexperience suboptimal control of their symptoms despite \\nimprovements in their spirometry and airway inflammation.\\nWHAT IS ASTHMA AND ASTHMA \\nCONTROL? REVIEWING THE DEFINITION\\ndefInItIon of asthMa\\nAsthma is defined as a chronic inflammatory disorder associated \\nwith physiological abnormalities in the airways, namely, variable \\nairflow limitation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR).1 The \\nphysiological perturbations in the airways are associated with the \\nvariable symptoms of breathlessness, chest tightness, wheeze, or \\ncough. At times, these symptoms may be mild or even absent. \\nOn the other hand, symptoms may worsen acutely or subacutely \\nleading to an asthmatic flare-up or exacerbation.\\nwhat Is asthMa control ?\\nAsthma control is defined as the extent to which the effects \\nof the disease are reduced or removed by treatment.2 Asthma \\nthat is well controlled is characterized by infrequent day -\\ntime symptoms, no activity limitation, no nocturnal symp -\\ntoms, and normal lung function (Table 16.1). It is important \\nTABLE 16.1\\nLevels of Asthma Control in Adults and Children over 5 Years\\nA.

Since the disease is inherently variable over \\ntime, an assessment of asthma control should address both \\nthe current state of a person’s asthma as well as accounting \\nfor the risk of problems in the future. Hence, the terms cur-\\nrent control  and future risk  have been advocated.2,3\\nThe concept of future risk is intended to highlight the \\npotential limitations of focusing solely on current symp -\\ntoms, which would fail to address the known factors that \\naffect the clinical course of this disease over time. Future \\nrisk refers to the risk of adverse outcomes in the future, \\nincluding exacerbations, the risk of accelerated lung function \\ndecline, or even the risk of side effects from medications. \\nPoorly controlled asthma is a known risk factor for future \\nexacerbations. In particular, nighttime symptoms and more \\nfrequent short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) use are strongly \\nassociated with an increased risk for a future exacerbation.4 \\nHowever, other risk factors for adverse outcomes, indepen -\\ndent of the patient’s level of current control, have also been \\nidentified. Asthma exacerbations can be triggered by a num -\\nber of factors, including allergens, pollution, and infections. \\nViral infections account for most asthma exacerbations in \\nadults,5 which is reflected by a peak in the hospitalization \\nrate every winter.6 Furthermore, a recent exacerbation is a \\nrisk factor for future exacerbations, highlighting the com -\\nplex interaction of future events and their relationship to air -\\nway function in the past. The relationship between current \\ncontrol and future exacerbations is another reason why an \\nassessment of asthma control should be conducted at every \\nclinical encounter.\\nThe current emphasis on asthma control in clinical \\nmanagement differs from the earlier emphasis on asthma \\nseverity. Asthma severity was previously defined in terms \\nof its clinical features before  any treatment; this was thought \\nto reflect the intrinsic qualities of the disease.2 However, \\nthis definition was impractical once patients started regular \\ntreatment.\\nWHY IS AN ASSESSMENT OF ASTHMA \\nCONTROL IMPORTANT?\\nto understand  the IMpact of asthMa on the patIent\\nThe assessment of asthma control should identify the fre -\\nquency and/or intensity of asthma-related symptoms. \\nThrough this process, the clinician is able to appreciate the \\neffect of asthma on the individual patient and how it may be \\nimpacting on his or her quality of life.\\nto predIct the rIsK of future  adverse  outco Mes\\nAs mentioned previously, poor asthma control is a risk factor \\nfor future exacerbations.

On the other hand, patients with well-con -\\ntrolled asthma should have their ICS treatment down-titrated. \\nHence, the assessment of asthma control is integral to the \\nmanagement decisions made during follow-up.\\nto facIlItate patIent–doctor  coMMunIcatIon \\nabout  asthMa Manage Ment\\nDuring the process of assessing asthma control, the clinician \\nis able to identify issues that may be contributing to subopti -\\nmal control. Categorizing the patient’s level of asthma con -\\ntrol may be used as a means of educating the patient about \\nthe disease and establishing treatment aims. A comprehen -\\nsive assessment of asthma control addressing symptom fre -\\nquency, lung function, and risk factors allows the clinician to \\ntailor treatment type and dose to the individual patient.\\nHOW CAN WE MEASURE ASTHMA CONTROL?\\nSince the publication of the first asthma guidelines, the goals \\nof treatment have been described in terms of controlling symp -\\ntoms; reliever use; and avoiding activity limitation, exacerba -\\ntions, and side effects. The concepts of asthma control have \\nthus been accepted by consensus for many years, although \\nthere is no gold standard for measuring asthma control.\\nThe measurement of current control should include an \\nassessment of symptoms as well as some measure of lung \\nfunction. Inevitably, there is a subjective component to \\nasthma control and it can be regarded as a patient-centered \\noutcome in asthma. Although asthma symptoms relate to \\nlung function abnormalities, these correlations are weak. \\nThis is partly due to the lack of specificity of asthma \\nsymptoms. However, it is unlikely that a single physiologi -\\ncal parameter will adequately reflect asthma control in its \\nentirety. Ultimately, a multimodal assessment is advocated, \\none that measures some aspect of airway function as well \\nas the measurement of more subjective parameters such as \\npatient-reported symptoms.\\nWhen a discrepancy is found between symptoms and \\nobjective lung function, this should prompt the consideration \\nof alternative or additional diagnoses; for example, in patients \\nwith frequent symptoms but normal lung function, the symp -\\ntoms may be found to be due to a comorbidity such as vocal \\ncord dysfunction (VCD) or obesity; and in patients with few \\nsymptoms but abnormal lung function, chronic obstructive \\npulmonary disease (COPD) may coexist, or they may have \\na poor perception of airway obstruction.

In general, three \\ncategories of asthma control have been used in the guide -\\nlines (Table 16.1). However, the degree of asthma control \\nshould be viewed as a continuum along a spectrum. Different \\nguidelines have used different terminology to categorize the \\ndegree of control. Commonly used terms are controlled , \\npartly controlled , and poorly controlled , as recommended by \\nthe Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Some have used the \\nterms totally controlled , well controlled , and uncontrolled , \\nwhereas others prefer terms such as optimal  and subopti -\\nmal control . The GINA controlled/partly controlled catego -\\nries together correspond to a score of <1.0 on the five-item \\nAsthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).7 A numeric score, \\nhowever, may be more responsive to a change in the level of \\ncontrol over time.7\\nsyMptoMs\\nIt is recognized that the assessment of asthma control in pri -\\nmary care is predominantly based on asthma symptoms. To \\nhelp facilitate this, a checklist of the relevant symptoms may \\nbe useful (Table 16.2). The frequency of asthma symptoms \\ncan be assessed over the preceding week or month, but the \\nsame time period should be used in follow-up for compari -\\nson. The triggers for patient symptoms, such as allergens, \\npollution, exercise, and respiratory tract infections, should \\nalso be ascertained.\\nAsthma symptoms can be difficult to distinguish from \\nother respiratory causes. The British Guideline on the Management of Asthma8 provides a useful summary of \\nthe features that make the diagnosis of asthma more or less \\nlikely. It should also be emphasized that not all respiratory \\nsymptoms reported by a patient with asthma are due to \\nasthma itself (see the section “Who Benefits from Regular \\nAssessment?”). Hence, an overreliance on symptoms for \\nthe assessment of asthma control could potentially lead to \\novertreatment. On the other hand, symptoms may be under -\\nreported by those with a sedentary lifestyle since exercise-\\ninduced bronchoconstriction leading to symptoms occurs \\nless frequently in these individuals. Finally, symptom per -\\nception is heterogeneous and is affected by airway inflamma -\\ntion and ICS treatment.9\\nSymptoms can be recorded either prospectively in patient \\ndiaries or retrospectively by patient recall. The latter is most \\ncommonly employed in clinical practice. Symptoms are \\noften recorded along a severity scale. On the other hand, doc -\\numenting specific numeric variables such as the “number of \\ndays per week with symptoms” or “number of stairs that may \\nbe climbed without stopping” is often useful for comparison \\nat follow-up visits.\\nThe variability of the disease is important when assess -\\ning symptoms at any time point. Such an assessment must \\naccount for the change in symptoms from week to week. \\nHence, an assessment of control over shorter time periods \\nmay overestimate the degree of asthma control. For example, \\npatients with daily symptoms and poorly controlled asthma \\nat recruitment into a 3-month study who received as-needed \\nSABA alone had a well-controlled asthma week on average \\nevery 4 weeks during the study.10\\nnIght waKIng due to asthMa\\nAsthma symptoms tend to follow a diurnal pattern.

On the other hand, SABA use is still \\nadvocated for the short-term relief of bronchospasm, and \\nit may be lifesaving in acute severe asthma. Making such \\na distinction can be difficult for both the patient and the \\nclinician.\\nThe clues that suggest the inappropriate overuse of SABA \\ninclude normal lung function during symptoms or despite \\nfrequent symptoms, the lack of an acute bronchodilator \\nimprovement on spirometry, and a decrease in the duration \\nof the perceived effectiveness of SABA. The use of peak \\nflow monitoring may help some subjects distinguish symp -\\ntoms that are not related to asthma. The corollary, however, \\ndoes not hold since peak flow readings can be reduced due to \\nseveral factors including poor effort, inadequate inspiration, \\nor upper airway pathology. The frequency of the symptoms \\nand the need for reliever medication are also influenced by \\nthe concurrent use of LABA.\\nactIvIty lIMItatIon\\nAn appreciation of the impact of asthma on daily activity \\nis also important when assessing asthma control. Patients \\nwith asthma should be encouraged to engage in all aspects \\nof physical activity.

The ACQ is sensitive to within-patient changes \\nand correlates well with other patient-related health mea -\\nsures, such as the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire. \\nThe symptom-only five-item ACQ (ACQ-5) correlates very \\nclosely to the full-length ACQ and has been commonly used \\nin patients taking regular ICS/LABA, since prebroncho -\\ndilator FEV1 is not usually available.15,16 While this could \\nbe viewed as evidence that both versions are measuring the \\nsame construct, it is more likely a consequence of math -\\nematical averaging since FEV1 contributes proportionally \\nless to the overall ACQ score than the five symptom items.17 \\nA\\xa0change in the ACQ score of 0.5 is considered clinically \\nimportant.16\\nThe Asthma Control Test (ACT) is another commonly \\nused questionnaire for the assessment of asthma control. \\nThe ACT is administered by the patient and is composed \\nof five items; four relate to the clinical features of asthma \\nand the fifth is a global self-assessment of asthma control.14 \\nIn contrast to the ACQ, the ACT measures symptoms over \\nthe preceding 4 weeks and does not include a physiological \\nmeasurement, with the authors retaining this as an indepen -\\ndent component of the asthma control assessment. The ACT \\nhas also been validated in research and in clinical practice. \\nA change in the ACT score of 3 is considered clinically \\nimportant.18\\nThe Royal College of Physicians (RCP) has published \\na brief three-question screening tool to assess asthma \\ncontrol (RCP “3 questions”) in people over the age of 16 \\n(Table\\xa016.2).8 The questions can be applied to either the last \\nweek or the last month (but, again, the same time period \\nshould be consistently used so that comparisons can be made \\nover time and between patients). This tool is feasible for use \\nin primary care and can identify patients who need more \\nthorough assessment of their symptoms.19\\nOne pragmatic approach in the assessment of asthma \\ncontrol is to measure the ACQ-5 or ACT, as a measure of \\nsymptom control, and separately consider FEV1 as a mea -\\nsure that provides independent information relevant to \\nasthma control.\\npatIent-perce Ived asthMa control\\nClinical surveys often report that patients underestimate \\ntheir level of poor control.20 However, a patient’s under -\\nstanding of the term asthma control  may be at odds with \\nthe medical meaning of the term. Patients might con -\\nsider their disease well controlled if their symptoms are \\nrapidly relieved (or controlled) by a SABA. This discrep -\\nancy between the patients’ perception and the clinicians’ \\napproach suggests that education efforts need to continue \\nto improve patient outcome. An important limitation in the \\ncare of someone with asthma is the low attendance rate for follow-up. It is possible that patients might return for clini -\\ncal review more consistently if there was an expectation \\non the part of the patients that their lung function would \\nbe routinely measured in addition to receiving a clinical \\nexamination and an assessment of their symptom control. \\nIn doing so, the numeric feedback from measuring one’s \\nlung function, something akin to measuring the blood \\npressure, serves as an incentive for the patient to return for \\nreview again.\\nSIMPLE LUNG FUNCTION TESTING\\nMeasuring lung function is essential for the diagnosis as well \\nas the ongoing monitoring of asthma.\\nlIMItatIons of peaK flow Meters\\nPeak flow devices are commonly used in primary care but \\nthey have significant limitations. The devices are not cali -\\nbrated and readings may differ on different devices. A single \\npeak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement is neither sensitive \\nnor specific for a diagnosis of asthma.\\nThe serial measurement of PEF readings over time may \\nindicate a significant diurnal variability and this may be \\nsufficient to confirm a diagnosis of asthma in patients with \\ntypical asthma symptoms.1 Similarly, in a patient with a \\nconfirmed diagnosis of asthma, serial peak flow recordings \\nperformed on the same device by the same patient may pro -\\nvide very useful information about the trend over time. For \\nexample, a peak flow trend may provide a clue about occu -\\npational or recreational exposures. On the other hand, the \\npresence of increased diurnal variability would be consis -\\ntent with suboptimal control.21 Furthermore, a downward \\ntrend in the peak flow readings may herald the onset of an \\nexacerbation.\\nThe most common method of calculating  within-day  vari-\\nability (diurnal variability) is amplitude percent mean (day’s \\nhighest minus lowest/mean), averaged over 7 days; the upper \\nlimit of normal with twice-daily PEF readings is 8%. A com -\\nmon method of calculating between-day  PEF variability is \\nthe lowest PEF (or lowest morning PEF) over 1 or 2 weeks, \\ndivided by the highest PEF.2 There is a moderate relationship \\nbetween diurnal variability and AHR.\\nspIroMetry should  be Measured  when \\nassess Ing asthMa control\\nSpirometry is a reliable and standardized test of airway func -\\ntion. It measures flow and volume and predominantly reflects \\nthe physiology of the larger, more central airways.

In general \\nterms, a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio indicates airway obstruc -\\ntion and the FEV1 declines with the worsening severity of the \\ndisease. The presence of significant reversibility ( >200 mL \\nimprovement and >12% improvement in either FEV1 or \\nFVC) on spirometry in a patient established on ICS might be \\nan indication of suboptimal treatment. FEV1 improves within \\n2 months of treatment with ICS, whereas AHR continues \\nto improve beyond 1 year of continuous anti-inflammatory \\ntreatment.24\\nA single spirometry measurement correlates only weakly \\nwith patient symptoms,25 but low lung function has been con -\\nsistently found to be an independent predictor of the risk of \\nexacerbations,26 and discordance between spirometry and \\nsymptoms may prompt the consideration of alternative or \\nadditional diagnoses that are contributing to the symptoms. \\nHence, the combination of a spirometry measurement and \\nthe patient’s symptom profile provides a more comprehen -\\nsive assessment of the disease status. Respiratory symptoms \\nmay also persist despite normal spirometry and in these cases \\nreferral for further lung function tests and specialist input \\nwould be indicated.\\nIn a patient with asthma, spirometry should be performed \\nto confirm the diagnosis, and then, if possible, it should \\nbe repeated 3–6 months after the commencement of regu -\\nlar treatment to document the patient’s best lung function. \\nSubsequently, spirometry should ideally be repeated once a \\nyear so that an accelerated lung function decline can be iden -\\ntified, or if worsening asthma symptoms fail to respond to a \\nstep-up in treatment.\\nWHO BENEFITS FROM REGULAR ASSESSMENT?\\nEveryone with asthma should be reviewed regularly. At the \\nfirst clinical encounter, the diagnosis should be confirmed. \\nIf there is doubt about the diagnosis, the patient should be \\nreferred for a second opinion and further testing to ascertain \\nthe nature of the lung abnormality. Such an approach should \\nreduce the risk of misdiagnosis, incorrect treatment, and \\nan incorrect label of “severe” or “refractory” disease if the \\nsymptoms are not due to asthma itself. At each subsequent \\nvisit, an assessment of asthma control allows the clinician to \\nreview the treatment prescribed and adjust the dose of medi -\\ncation as appropriate. In this way, over- and undertreatment \\ncan be avoided.\\nIt is suggested that asthma control be assessed at \\nleast annually and ideally twice per year, in all patients \\nwith asthma. Asthma control should also be reviewed \\n1–3 months after any change in treatment (step-up or step-down) or if worsening symptoms develop at any time. \\nPatients with severe and difficult-to-treat asthma should \\nbe reviewed every 2–3 months. Spirometry should at least \\nbe measured at diagnosis and then annually in clinically \\nstable patients.\\nASTHMA CONTROL IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS\\nSome patients are more likely to have suboptimally con -\\ntrolled asthma and may benefit from a more frequent or \\nintense review.\\nrhInos InusItIs\\nAsthma and rhinitis often coexist.

An obese patient with asthma is \\nexposed to the additive effects of an altered respiratory sys -\\ntem physiology associated with obesity as well as an altered \\nairway physiology associated with asthma.31 Specifically \\nthere is some evidence that an expiratory flow limitation is \\nmore likely to develop during tidal breathing in the presence \\nof bronchoconstriction, and this may be associated with per -\\nsistent asthma symptoms despite ICS treatment.32 Treatment \\nstrategies such as exercise and weight reduction should be \\nadvocated since studies also suggest that these have a benefi -\\ncial effect on asthma control.\\nobstruct Ive sleep apnea\\nOSA has also been associated with poor asthma con -\\ntrol independent of obesity,33 and there is some evidence \\nthat asthma control improves with sleep apnea treatment.

The symp -\\ntoms typically respond poorly to beta-agonists and patients \\noften utilize more medical resources with repeated atten -\\ndances for clinical review. Although the diagnosis of VCD \\nmay be difficult between acute episodes, normal spirom -\\netry with a suggestive history should alert the clinician to \\nthis possibility. In such circumstances, ICS dose escalation \\nshould be avoided. Instead, an assessment of the upper air -\\nway in a dedicated voice clinic with an ear, nose, and throat \\n(ENT) surgeon and a speech pathologist can be helpful.36\\nsMoKIng\\nSmoking is, unfortunately, common among asthmatics. It is \\nan important comorbidity that should be assessed in every \\npatient with asthma. Smoking is associated with worse \\nasthma control, more severe symptoms, and increased SABA \\nuse.37 The detrimental effects of smoking on lung func -\\ntion are well known.38 However, patients with asthma who \\nsmoke are also particularly susceptible to accelerated lung \\nfunction decline.39 Furthermore, smoking is associated with \\na reduction in the effectiveness of inhaled and oral cortico -\\nsteroids40 and patients with asthma who smoke may require \\nan increased ICS dose for a similar benefit compared with \\nnonsmoking patients. Hence, smoking can adversely affect \\nthe current control and future risk of the disease.REFERRAL FOR SPECIALIST INVESTIGATIONS\\nThe majority of patients with asthma have mild to moder -\\nate disease and can be managed in primary care.

Specifically, patients should \\nbe referred if they experience recurrent exacerbations, sig -\\nnificant limitation of activity due to asthma, frequent symp -\\ntoms despite normal lung function, or frequent symptoms \\ndespite treatment with ICS/LABA after confirming that their \\ninhaler technique and adherence are adequate. Patients with \\nmore severe or difficult-to-treat asthma may benefit from \\nmore detailed lung function testing to optimally assess their \\nasthma control and guide treatment strategies.\\nchest x-ray\\nA chest roentgenogram (CXR) is not usually needed as part \\nof the assessment of asthma except in the context of acute \\nsevere asthma when a pneumothorax or pneumonia may \\nneed to be excluded.\\nhIgh-resolut Ion coMputed  toMography  chest scans\\nHigh-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans of the \\nchest provide better resolution of the large and medium air -\\nways as well as the lung parenchyma compared with a CXR. \\nHowever, the potential benefit in clinical practice must be \\nweighed against the radiation risk that is associated with such \\na scan. Patients that may warrant imaging as part of their \\nassessment include patients with chronic sputum production \\nto exclude bronchiectasis associated with allergic broncho -\\npulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) or common variable immu -\\nnodeficiency; patients with fever, malaise, or  haemoptysis to \\nexclude tumors; patients who also smoke to exclude emphy -\\nsema; and patients with recurrent exacerbations to exclude an \\nabnormal airway anatomy. In all cases, the CT scan should \\nideally be performed several weeks after the resolution of an \\nacute infection.\\nbronch Ial provocat Ion testIng\\nDocumenting the presence of AHR may be important when \\nconfirming the diagnosis of asthma in a new patient. Once \\nregular treatment is underway, the absence of AHR does not \\nexclude asthma, but it may permit more confidence in step -\\nping down treatment even if some nonspecific symptoms \\npersist. AHR is a physiological abnormality characteristic \\nof asthma that can be measured in a laboratory using direct \\nor indirect bronchial provocation tests. It is often measured \\nas the dose or concentration of an inhaled spasmogen that \\ncauses a predefined fall in FEV1 (usually 15% or 20%). The \\ndegree of AHR is variable over time and the abnormality is \\nusually responsive to ICS treatment.24 The sensitivity and \\nspecificity of the provocation tests depend on the population \\nbeing studied (general population screening vs. selecting ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 188}),\n"," Document(page_content='171 Assessment of Asthma Control in Adults\\nthose with respiratory symptoms). Thus, the test results must \\nbe interpreted in the clinical context. Nevertheless, AHR has \\nprognostic significance in asthma and correlates with long-\\nterm morbidity.41\\nbreath  testIng for exhaled  nItrIc oxIde\\nMeasuring exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) may be useful as \\na nonspecific marker of corticosteroid-responsive airway \\ninflammation. There are several commercially available \\nhandheld devices but their performance characteristics dif -\\nfer. Hence, repeat measures are most useful when they are \\nperformed on the same device.42\\nIn some patients, the FeNO level is elevated at diagno -\\nsis, reduces with ICS treatment, and correlates with clinical \\nasthma control over time.43,44 During monitoring, a signifi -\\ncant rise in the FeNO level might indicate an increased risk \\nof loss of control. An FeNO measurement is useful in patients \\nwhere the contribution of eosinophilic airway inflammation \\nto poor asthma control is unclear due to other comorbidities \\nand it is useful to identify the likelihood of a response to ICS \\ntreatment.45\\nsputu M Induct Ion for Infla MMatory  cell count\\nPatients with difficult-to-treat or severe asthma may be \\nreferred for a sputum cell count analysis as part of a range of \\nsecond-line investigations. The availability of sputum sam -\\npling remains limited to certain tertiary and research cen -\\nters. The knowledge of a patient’s inflammatory profile can \\nhelp tailor his or her treatment since eosinophilic asthma is \\ntypically more responsive to ICS treatment compared with \\nneutrophilic asthma.46 An ICS treatment algorithm guided \\nby the presence of sputum eosinophilia was associated with \\nreduced exacerbations. Interestingly, in the same study, \\nthe symptoms and quality of life measures did not signifi -\\ncantly differ from treatment with a usual care algorithm. \\nHence, reducing eosinophilic airway inflammation may be \\nof greater importance for the reduction of future risk than \\nthe assessment of current control, especially in patients in \\nwhom the symptoms are discordant with the degree of air -\\nway inflammation.\\ncoMplex lung funct Ion testIng\\nThe small airways are clinically relevant for assessing \\ncurrent symptoms and predicting future asthma con -\\ntrol. The degree of ventilation inhomogeneity, a sensi -\\ntive marker of small airway dysfunction, correlates with \\nsymptom control measured using the ACQ-5 and it is a \\nstronger determinant of current symptoms than spirom -\\netry or FeNO.47 Furthermore, abnormal ventilation in the \\ndistal intra-acinar airways predicts an increased likeli -\\nhood for loss of control following ICS down-titration in \\notherwise well-controlled patients.48 Other, less sensitive measures of small airway dysfunction, such as the degree \\nof air trapping49 and the propensity for airway closure,50 \\nhave also been associated with the severity of asthma, \\nthe risk of exacerbations, and poor asthma control. These \\ndetailed lung function tests allow us to better understand \\nthe behavior of the airway in asthma. They are easy to \\nperform and are used in certain clinical situations, such as \\npediatrics cystic fibrosis, as a monitoring tool. However, \\nmost of these tests are currently confined to research and \\ntertiary care centers.\\nOTHER FACTORS MAY CONTRIBUTE \\nTO POOR ASTHMA CONTROL\\nAn assessment of asthma control in clinical practice is \\nnot complete without also assessing the patient’s inhaler \\ndevice technique, adherence with controller medication, \\nand ownership and understanding of a written asthma \\naction plan.\\nSUMMARY\\nAsthma is a common condition that continues to cause sig -\\nnificant morbidity in the community, but the burden of the \\ndisease is often hidden as patients perceive asthma symp -\\ntoms as “normal” and do not mention them unless prompted. \\nAn assessment of asthma control should address both cur -\\nrent control and future risk. Current asthma control should \\nbe assessed at every consultation using several modalities if \\npossible. In primary care, an assessment of the symptoms as \\nwell as a spirometry is advocated. Poor asthma control and \\nprevious exacerbations are among the risk factors for a future \\nexacerbation. Comorbidities should be addressed to optimize \\nasthma control. A suggested checklist for the assessment of \\nasthma control is shown in Table 16.4. Novel measures of \\nlung function may prove to be more useful for the assessment \\nof asthma control but they remain largely as research tools. \\nPatients with a poor response to standard inhaled treatment \\nshould be referred for further lung function testing and spe -\\ncialist advice.\\nTABLE 16.4\\nQuick Checklist for Assessing Asthma \\nControl\\nA Adherence\\nB Bronchodilator use (reliever use >2 per \\nweek)\\nC Control of symptoms (subjective \\nassessment by patient) \\nD Disability (limitation of activity)\\nE Exacerbations recently\\nF FEV1', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 189}),\n"," Document(page_content='172 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nREFERENCES\\n 1.

\\nPRESCHOOL- AND SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN\\nThe principles of asthma management in preschool- and \\nschool-age children have evolved substantially over the past \\ntwo decades to the current approach that is guided by the \\ngoals of the attainment and maintenance of asthma con -\\ntrol (see Chapter 16). In contrast to asthma severity, which \\ndefines the intrinsic intensity of asthma as assessed with -\\nout the use of a controller therapy, asthma control reflects \\nthe degree to which the signs and symptoms of asthma are \\nminimized. Thus, successful asthma management achieves \\nmultiple goals, including (1) the minimization of day-to-\\nday asthma-related symptomatology (i.e., a reduction in the \\ncurrent impairment domain of asthma); (2) the reduction or \\nelimination of asthma exacerbations; (3) the minimization of \\ntreatment-related side effects; and (4) ideally, the prevention \\nof impaired lung growth and progressive decline in lung func -\\ntion (i.e., a reduction in the future risk domain of asthma).\\nPreschool-age children often exhibit asthma that is more \\nexacerbation prone than impairment dominant, while school-\\nage children begin to demonstrate elements of both impair -\\nment and risk. The recognition of these different phenotypes \\nand patterns of asthma expression has directed the research \\nexamining different treatment strategies in these two age \\ngroups, with exacerbation prevention and disease modifica -\\ntion being the major focuses in preschool-age children while \\nexacerbation prevention has been coupled with impairment \\nreduction and interventions to prevent declines in lung func -\\ntion among school-age children.\\nHETEROGENEITY OF EARLY CHILDHOOD \\nWHEEZING AND ASTHMA\\nRecurrent wheezing in the preschool-age group is a highly \\nheterogeneous disorder, with multiple disease phenotypes \\nbased on the age of onset, age and likelihood of remission, \\nconcomitant risk factors (especially atopy), and trigger -\\ning factors (such as viral infections). These multiple differ -\\nent phenotypic expressions of early childhood asthma are \\nlikely due to different underlying immunopathophysiologi -\\ncal mechanisms, which may confer differential responses to \\ntherapeutic strategies. The heterogeneity of early childhood \\nwheezing and asthma complicates the interpretation of much \\nof the early research done in this population, as most of the \\nearly studies enrolled very heterogeneous populations of sub -\\njects rather than specific wheezing phenotypes. Fortunately, \\nseveral recent studies have begun to focus on more well-\\ndefined and homogeneous populations, providing evidence \\nto guide decision making in this challenging age group.\\nSTEPWISE APPROACH TO ASTHMA CARE\\nOver the past decade, several asthma guidelines have been \\ndeveloped that provide carefully developed treatment recom -\\nmendations for children with asthma, including the National \\nAsthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP),1 the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA),2 and the European \\nRespiratory Society (ERS) task force.3 All of these guide -\\nlines have proposed algorithms for the pharmacological \\nmanagement of asthma using stepwise approaches, with the \\nsteps of care being aligned with the levels of both the asthma \\nseverity and control. While the guidelines differ in terms of \\nthe number of steps of care and the order of preferences of \\ntreatments within each step,4 there is a consensus that the \\nachievement of asthma control is the major goal of therapy \\nand that an individualized approach for each child is neces -\\nsary based on the level of control achieved.\\nMANAGEMENT OF INTERMITTENT \\nDISEASE (STEP 1 CARE)\\nAccording to the NAEPP guidelines, children with inter -\\nmittent asthma under the age of 12 should receive Step 1 \\ncare (Figure 17.1), which includes as-needed use of a short-\\nacting beta-agonist (SABA). The phenotype of intermittent \\nasthma is most apparent in the preschool population, where \\nit has been referred to using various terminology, including \\nsevere intermittent asthma  and episodic viral wheeze . This \\nphenotype exemplifies an exacerbation-dominant disease \\nwith minimal to no intercurrent symptomatology. However, \\ngiven the substantial morbidity experienced during these epi -\\nsodes, therapeutic strategies aiming to prevent or attenuate \\nepisode severity, ranging from daily preventative therapy to \\nepisodic therapy, have been studied.

Daily treatment with low-dose ICS (fluticasone \\npropionate 88 mcg twice daily) for 2 years in children aged \\n2–3 years with a recurrent wheeze, the absence of evidence \\nof ongoing asthma impairment, and risk factors for the per -\\nsistence of asthma (positive modified Asthma Predictive \\nIndex) resulted in significantly fewer oral corticosteroid \\ncourses and more episode-free days than did a placebo over \\nthe 2-year period.8 A meta-analysis of 29 studies of infants \\nand preschool-age children with recurrent wheeze or asthma \\ndemonstrated a reduction of approximately 40% in the risk of \\nexacerbations associated with daily ICS therapy as well as an \\nimproved symptom burden and lung function.9 Daily therapy \\nwith montelukast produced a significant reduction in asthma \\nexacerbations relative to a placebo among 2- to 5-year-old \\nchildren with intermittent asthma, but it did not impact the \\nfrequency of oral corticosteroid use.10 A recent study com -\\npared the efficacy of daily low-dose ICS (budesonide 0.5 mg \\ndaily) with the episodic use of high-dose ICS (budesonide \\n1 mg twice daily started at the early signs of a respiratory \\nillness) among 12- to 53-month-old children with recurrent \\nwheeze, positive modified Asthma Predictive Indices, and \\nan exacerbation in the previous year, and demonstrated no \\ndifference between the two treatment strategies in terms of \\noral corticosteroid use, episode severity, indicators of daily \\nasthma impairment, or linear growth.11 Currently, there are \\nno studies directly comparing daily ICS and daily leukot -\\nriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) therapy in intermittent \\nasthma in preschool-age children to determine the relative \\nefficacies of these approaches.\\nMANAGEMENT OF PERSISTENT \\nASTHMA (STEP 2 CARE)\\ndaIly Ics t herapy\\nThere is consensus among guidelines that children with per -\\nsistent asthma should receive daily controller therapy in an \\neffort to reduce the elements of asthma impairment and risk. \\nNearly all guidelines endorse low-dose ICS therapy as the \\npreferred controller for the management of mild persistent \\nasthma (Step 2), based on a multitude of trials in preschool \\nand school-age populations that demonstrate improvements \\nin nearly all facets of asthma impairment and risk. Daily \\nICS therapy has consistently been shown to reduce days \\nand nights with asthma symptoms, exacerbations requiring \\noral corticosteroids, health-care utilization, urgent care vis -\\nits, hospitalizations, as well as physiological measures such \\nas bronchial hyperresponsiveness and exhaled nitric oxide \\nlevels. While many studies have shown an improvement in lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec [FEV1]) \\nover relatively short time intervals (12 weeks), the Childhood \\nAsthma Management Program (CAMP) demonstrated that \\namong children aged 5–12 years with mild to moderate \\nasthma, and despite significant improvements in multiple \\nclinical measures of asthma control, there was no significant \\ndifference in lung function after 4.3 years of low-dose ICS \\ntherapy (budesonide 200 mcg twice daily) relative to a pla -\\ncebo,12 nor was there a difference in lung function 4.8 years \\nafter stopping daily ICS therapy.13\\nICS therapy is generally well tolerated by the majority \\nof pediatric patients. However, the potential side effects of \\nICS therapy, which are generally dose dependent, include \\nalterations in skeletal growth, bone density, hypothalamic-\\npituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, and local side effects \\nincluding oral candidiasis and hoarseness. The clearly estab -\\nlished clinical benefits provided by daily ICS therapy must \\nbe weighed against the potential risks associated with this \\napproach in preschool-age children. The effect of ICS ther -\\napy on linear growth may be dependent on multiple factors, \\nincluding age, weight, ICS dosing, the specific ICS prod -\\nuct, and the delivery system. Multiple studies in school-age \\nchildren have consistently demonstrated a clinically mod -\\nest but statistically significant effect on linear growth (typi -\\ncally ~1.1 cm over the first year of therapy) with budesonide \\nand beclomethasone, while studies in preschool-age chil -\\ndren have been less consistent, demonstrating either similar \\ngrowth effects8,14 or no statistically significant effects of ICS \\ntherapy15–17 on growth velocity. Long-term follow-up reveals \\nthat the growth-suppressive effects of ICS therapy on chil -\\ndren are generally small on average, and appear to improve \\nover time in most children, but there remain subgroups of \\nchildren who experience greater than expected reductions in \\nlinear growth. The regular monitoring of growth in children \\nreceiving ICS therapy remains appropriate, with titration of \\nthe ICS dosing to the minimally effective dose.\\ndaIly ltra t herapy\\nAmong preschool-age children with persistent asthma, mon -\\ntelukast given daily over 12 weeks significantly reduces \\nasthma symptom frequency, rescue albuterol use, oral cor -\\nticosteroid use, peripheral blood eosinophil levels, bronchial \\nhyperreactivity, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels.18–20 \\nSimilarly, among school-age children, montelukast therapy \\nreduced asthma symptoms and rescue albuterol use while \\nimproving pulmonary function, quality of life, and periph -\\neral blood eosinophil counts over an 8-week period in chil -\\ndren aged 6–14 years with moderate asthma compared with \\na placebo,21 as well as inhibiting exercise-induced broncho -\\nconstriction in school-aged children with mild to moderate \\nasthma.22\\nMontelukast therapy has demonstrated an excellent over -\\nall safety profile in pediatric patients, with upper respiratory \\ntract infection, worsening asthma, pharyngitis, and fever as \\nthe most commonly reported side effects.23 Neuropsychiatric \\nevents have been reported infrequently in patients of all ages ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 198}),\n"," Document(page_content='181 Management of Pediatric Asthma\\ntaking montelukast, with preschool and school-age children \\nnot appearing to be more susceptible to such effects than \\nolder individuals.24\\nThe NAEPP/Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR3) guidelines \\nrecommend ICS as the preferred controller at Step 2, with \\nmontelukast identified as an alternative based on several com -\\nparative trials and supported by a meta-analysis demonstrat -\\ning greater efficacy for ICS therapy in general compared with \\nLTRA therapy in terms of markers of asthma control, includ -\\ning symptom reduction, exacerbation prevention, and lung \\nfunction improvement.25–30 However, not all patients achieve \\nsuperior asthma control with ICS relative to LTRA, with \\nrecent research confirming that patient characteristics may \\nidentify patients who may experience a differential response \\nto ICS and LTRA. A crossover trial found that children with \\nlower levels of lung function or high levels of markers of \\nallergic inflammation (exhaled nitric oxide levels or greater \\nairway hyperresponsiveness) were more likely to experience \\ngreater improvements in lung function (FEV1) and other indi -\\ncators of asthma control with ICS therapy than with LTRA \\ntherapy,25,26 suggesting that ICS may be preferred over LTRA \\nin children with these features. However, children less than \\n10 years of age and those with urinary leukotriene C4 levels \\n>100 pg/mg were more likely to experience at least a 7.5% \\nimprovement in FEV1 while receiving montelukast over an \\n8-week period, but did not experience comparable improve -\\nments while receiving ICS, further emphasizing the signifi -\\ncant heterogeneity in response to asthma therapies. Based on \\ntheir overall efficacy relative to ICS, LTRA may be consid -\\nered as an alternative to ICS as a monotherapy at Step\\xa02, if for \\nsome reason ICS therapy is not desirable.\\nAPPROACHES FOR CHILDREN NOT \\nWELL CONTROLLED WITH STEP 2 \\n(AND ABOVE) THERAPY\\nAmong children with persistent asthma, most will achieve \\nasthma control with Step 2 therapy. When children fail to \\nachieve asthma control with either daily low-dose ICS or \\nLTRA therapy, considerations should include: (1) heteroge -\\nneity of the drug response (and thus a trial of an alternate \\nagent in Step 2); (2) suboptimal adherence to the medical reg -\\nimen; (3) improper drug administration techniques (e.g., an \\nineffective or incorrect inhalation technique); (4) comorbid \\nconditions (e.g., rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and \\nobesity); (5) ongoing trigger exposure (e.g., aeroallergens, \\nenvironmental tobacco smoke, and viral infections); and (6) \\npsychosocial factors (e.g., maternal and/or child stress and/\\nor depression). If the consideration and modification of these \\nfactors do not produce asthma control, a step-up to Step 3 is \\nindicated.\\nstep 3 c are and above\\nFor children aged 0–4 years, the NAEPP/EPR3 guidelines \\nrecommend escalating therapy to medium-dose ICS therapy \\nin patients not controlled with low-dose ICS therapy (Step 3), rather than instituting the combination therapy that is rec -\\nommended in school-age children, in an effort to maximize \\nthe likelihood that an effective dose of ICS will be deliv -\\nered to the lower airways before consideration of adjunctive \\n(i.e., combination) therapy.1 If the use of medium-dose ICS \\ntherapy does not achieve well-controlled asthma in children \\naged 0–4 years, the NAEPP/EPR3 guidelines suggest the \\nfollowing options for Step 4 care: the initiation of a combina -\\ntion controller therapy with a medium-dose ICS along with \\neither a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) or montelukast. \\nThere are limited data in this age group to firmly support \\nthese recommendations, and thus these recommendations are \\nlargely based on extrapolation from studies in older children \\nand adults. One recent randomized trial demonstrated an \\nimprovement in lung function but not a reduction in asthma \\nsymptoms or rescue medication use among 4- to 7-year-old \\nchildren with multiple-trigger wheeze treated with ICS plus \\na LABA relative to ICS treatment alone, although partici -\\npants who received ICS within the previous 6 months were \\nexcluded from this trial and thus it is not clear if these par -\\nticipants would have demonstrated inadequate control while \\nreceiving ICS alone to warrant consideration of the addition \\nof the LABA salmeterol.31 Clearly, additional, adequately \\ndesigned and powered, prospective, controlled trials of \\nICS + LABA therapy must be conducted in this age group in \\norder to determine the appropriate role for LABA therapy in \\nthis age group.\\nIn school-age children (5–11 years) not adequately con -\\ntrolled with low-dose ICS therapy, the NAEPP/EPR3 guide -\\nlines recommend the following as treatment options at \\nStep\\xa03: (1) low-dose ICS + LABA, (2) low-dose ICS + LTRA, \\n(3) low-dose ICS + theophylline, or (4) medium-dose ICS, \\nalthough relatively limited data for these approaches are \\navailable in this age group.\\nThe role of the addition of LABA to ICS therapy in school-\\nage children has been clarified over the past decade. An early \\ntrial demonstrated no difference in clinical or physiological \\noutcomes among children who received medium-dose ICS \\ncompared with those treated with low-dose ICS + LABA,32 \\nand a more recent noninferiority study demonstrated no dif -\\nferences in lung function, exacerbations, or adverse events \\nbetween children treated with low-dose ICS + LABA and \\nthose treated with medium-dose ICS.33 Two recent Cochrane \\nreviews concluded that the effect of the addition of LABA \\ntherapy to ICS, when compared with either the same dose of \\nICS alone or a higher dose of ICS alone, is not certain and \\nmay be associated with an increased risk of oral corticoste -\\nroid-treated exacerbations and hospitalizations.34,35 Similarly, \\na recent meta-analysis concluded that there is insufficient evi -\\ndence to determine if the addition of LTRA to ICS improves \\nasthma outcomes.30 However, since the publication of these \\nCochrane reviews and the meta-analysis, a prospective \\ntrial examined three step-up options among children aged \\n6–18 years with asthma inadequately controlled with low-\\ndose ICS.36 The addition of LABA to low-dose ICS was the \\napproach most likely to produce the best response in terms of \\na composite outcome, which included asthma exacerbations, ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 199}),\n"," Document(page_content='182 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nepisode-free days, and lung function. However, either of \\nthe other two therapies studied, the addition of an LTRA to \\nlow-dose ICS or an increase to medium-dose ICS, was the \\ntherapy most likely to produce the best response among sub -\\nstantial proportions of participants. These findings suggest \\nthat these three treatment strategies are indeed effective as \\nstep-up strategies among children with asthma inadequately \\ncontrolled with low-dose ICS, since nearly all children \\nrespond best to one of these strategies. African American \\nchildren were least likely to show the best response to the \\naddition of LTRA, and children without eczema were most \\nlikely to have the best response to LABA. Unfortunately, \\nother predictors for which therapy is best for a given indi -\\nvidual could not be clearly delineated. Thus, if a patient is \\ninadequately controlled with a given Step\\xa03 regimen, these \\ndata suggest changing to a different Step 3 approach before \\nmoving to Step 4.\\nThe benefits associated with LABA therapy must be bal -\\nanced against the potential risks of this class of therapeu -\\ntics. Largely based on trials in adolescents and adults, there \\nappears to be an increased risk of asthma-related death \\namong patients who are treated with a LABA relative to \\nthose not treated with a LABA, although the largest stud -\\nies demonstrating this effect did not mandate concomitant \\nICS use and provided LABA in a separate inhaler device, \\nmaking it unclear whether concurrent ICS use mitigates the \\nincreased risk associated with LABA. As noted earlier, while \\nthe evidence for the efficacy of LABA therapy in school-age \\nchildren appears generally supportive of this approach, sev -\\neral studies failed to demonstrate a significant improvement \\nwith ICS + LABA therapy. A recent study from the U.S. \\nFood and Drug Administration concluded that the use of a \\nLABA-containing therapy was associated with an increased \\nlikelihood of asthma-related death, hospitalization, and intu -\\nbation among children, and that additional data are required \\nto determine the risks of LABA in conjunction with ICS \\ntherapy.37 Based on these findings, step-down therapy should \\nbe routinely considered, although no prospective clinical trial \\ndata are available to guide how to accomplish step-down in \\nchildren in the safest and most effective manner.\\nteMporary  step-up In antIcIpatIon \\nof exposure  to predIctable  trIggers\\nAsthma exacerbations consistently increase in prevalence in \\nSeptember, presumably due to a combination of the return to \\nschool and the emergence of fall allergens and viral infec -\\ntions. Given the predictability of this increase, the augmen -\\ntation of therapy with montelukast in anticipation of this \\nincrease in risk has been evaluated. While one trial study -\\ning the addition of montelukast or a placebo to the usual \\nasthma therapy from September 1 to October 15 among 2- to \\n14-year-olds demonstrated significant reductions in days with \\nworse asthma symptoms (53% fewer) and unscheduled physi -\\ncian visits (78% fewer),38 a second trial was unable to identify \\na clinically relevant effect of the addition of montelukast to standard therapy just prior to return to school in school-age \\nchildren.39 Thus, it is unclear if such a temporary step-up \\nprovides consistent protection from the falltime increase in \\nasthma exacerbations.\\nIMMunotherapy\\nThe NAEPP/ERP3 guidelines suggest that allergen immu -\\nnotherapy be considered for patients with persistent asthma \\nfor whom there is a clear relationship between symptoms and \\nexposure to the allergens to which the patients are sensitive.1 \\nA recent meta-analysis and an evidence-based review both \\nconcluded that specific immunotherapy is effective in the \\nmanagement of selected patients with allergic asthma,40,41 \\nparticularly those with a sensitization to a single allergen. \\nIn contrast, a large placebo-controlled trial evaluating the \\nefficacy of multiallergen immunotherapy for 2 years in asth -\\nmatic children did not demonstrate a benefit among children \\nreceiving appropriate medical treatment for asthma.42 A \\nrecent trial demonstrated that immunotherapy in monosensi -\\ntized children with seasonal allergic rhinitis without asthma \\nmay prevent the subsequent development of asthma,43 sug-\\ngesting that immunotherapy may allow for asthma preven -\\ntion in children with sensitization to inhalant allergens.\\nMANAGEMENT OF SEVERE \\nASTHMA IN CHILDREN\\nThe evaluation and management of children who appear to \\nhave asthma that does not respond as expected to the step -\\nwise approach to asthma care involve several considerations, \\nas described in the section Approaches for Children Not \\nWell Controlled with Step 2 (and Above) Therapy, prior to \\na further escalation of stepwise care. However, should these \\nadditional strategies fail to bring asthma under control, any \\nfurther escalation of care becomes challenging due to the \\nrelative paucity of data to guide decision making.\\nFor children aged 0–4 years with severe asthma (i.e., \\nthose requiring Step 5 or 6 care), the NAEPP/EPR3 guide -\\nlines recommend, based on extrapolation from limited data \\nin older children, the use of high-dose ICS therapy in combi -\\nnation with either a LABA or LTRA, and the addition of oral \\ncorticosteroids in the most extreme cases.1\\nSimilarly, for children aged 5–11 years with severe \\nasthma, the NAEPP/EPR3 guidelines recommend, based \\nlargely on extrapolation from data in older children, the use \\nof high-dose ICS therapy in combination with a LABA as the \\npreferred therapy at Step 5, with ICS + LTRA or ICS + the-\\nophylline as alternatives, and the addition of oral corticoste -\\nroids to ICS + LABA in those patients requiring Step 6 care.1\\noMalIzuMab\\nThe anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibody omal -\\nizumab is currently not included in the NAEPP/EPR3 guide -\\nlines Steps 5 and 6 for children under the age of 12 years,1 ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 200}),\n"," Document(page_content='183 Management of Pediatric Asthma\\nlargely due to the lack of U.S. Food and Drug Administration \\n(FDA) approval in this age group.

A large trial conducted in inner-city children and ado -\\nlescents with asthma demonstrated that omalizumab therapy \\nfor 60 weeks produced a significant reduction in days with \\nasthma symptoms and risk of exacerbation despite reductions \\nin ICS and LABA use.48 A recent small trial also demon -\\nstrated the ability of omalizumab to permit a reduction in \\noral corticosteroid dosing in children aged 5–16 years receiv -\\ning maintenance oral corticosteroids therapy.49 Omalizumab \\nis currently approved in the United States as an adjunctive \\ntherapy for children aged 12 years and older with moderate to \\nsevere persistent allergic asthma whose symptoms are inad -\\nequately controlled with ICS therapy.\\nMANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS\\nExacerbations are often the dominant manifestation of \\nasthma in young children (i.e., preschool-age), and while \\nexacerbations tend to become less frequent as children \\nmature through adolescence, they remain a major source \\nof morbidity. Viral infections, most notably human rhino -\\nviruses, are the dominant trigger for acute exacerbations in \\nchildhood, with allergen-triggered exacerbations occurring \\nless frequently.\\nAn exacerbation may be defined as either moderate or \\nsevere,50 with moderate exacerbations consisting of events that \\nare troublesome to the patient, do not represent the patient’s \\nusual day-to-day symptom variation, are not severe, but \\nrequire prompt modification of treatment. A severe exacerba -\\ntion is one that requires urgent action in order to prevent a seri -\\nous outcome, such as asthma-related hospitalization or death.\\nThe development of an exacerbation generally evolves \\nover a period of days, highlighting the importance of recog -\\nnizing the early changes in asthma status as antecedents to \\nexacerbations. In addition to increases in the typical asthma \\nsymptoms such as cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath, \\nother signs and symptoms often precede asthma exacerba -\\ntions, including the emergence of upper respiratory tract \\ninfectious symptoms, behavioral changes, and other nonspe -\\ncific symptoms.51,52 Thus, attention should be focused on the \\noccurrence of such factors as warning signs of an impending \\nworsening of asthma.\\nquIcK relIever MedIcatIons\\nBeta2-Adrenergic Agonists\\nRapid-acting inhaled beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists pro -\\nduce bronchodilation and serve as the preferred treatment for acute symptoms and exacerbations of asthma. Several differ -\\nent beta2-agonists are currently available, and have compa -\\nrable efficacy and safety properties.\\nAnticholinergic Agents\\nThe parasympathetic nervous system contributes to the con -\\ntrol of the airway tone. In general, the degree of bronchodila -\\ntion achieved with anticholinergic agents (such as atropine \\nand ipratropium bromide) is less than that produced by \\ninhaled beta2-agonists. The addition of ipratropium bromide \\nto inhaled beta2-agonists during moderate to severe acute \\nexacerbations of asthma in children presenting in the emer -\\ngency department decreases the rates of hospitalization53 and \\nthe duration of time in the emergency department,54 but there \\nis no evidence to support the use of ipratropium in hospital -\\nized patients.\\nSystemic Corticosteroids\\nSystemic corticosteroids may be considered as quick-reliever \\nmedications due to their efficacy in moderate to severe \\nacute exacerbations of asthma among school-age children. \\nSystemic corticosteroids accelerate the resolution of acute \\nexacerbations of asthma in school-age children, and an \\nemergency department administration of corticosteroids \\ndecreases asthma admission rates55 and shortens the duration \\nof hospitalization. In contrast, recent studies in preschool-age \\nchildren with recurrent wheezing do not consistently demon -\\nstrate a clinical improvement with systemic corticosteroids,56 \\nand thus their use in wheezing exacerbations in this age \\ngroup is currently uncertain.57 The dosing recommendations \\nfor acute asthma range from 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight per \\nday of prednisone, with no significant difference in the effi -\\ncacy of oral or parenteral corticosteroids in acute asthma,58 \\nunless the child is unable to tolerate oral medications due \\nto vomiting. The clinically relevant suppression of the HPA \\naxis does not typically occur following short “bursts” of sys -\\ntemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of asthma, and \\ntapering of the dose is not required with courses of less than \\n10–14 days’ duration.\\nMONITORING AND REASSESSMENT\\nThe effective management of children with asthma is an \\nongoing process, requiring frequent reassessments to deter -\\nmine the degree of asthma control achieved with a treatment \\nregimen. In addition to a general inquiry into parents’ and \\npatients’ perceptions of the patients’ asthma status, sev -\\neral validated tools allow for the longitudinal quantifica -\\ntion of asthma control, including the Test for Respiratory \\nand Asthma Control in Kids (TRACK),59 the Childhood \\nAsthma Control Test (C-ACT),60,61 and the Asthma Control \\nQuestionnaire (ACQ).62\\nThe serial examination of the pulmonary function via spi -\\nrometry is an integral component of asthma monitoring and \\ncan generally be performed well on children over 5 years of \\nage, and occasionally on 4-year-old children.

The FEV1 is the most commonly used and reproducible \\nmeasure of pulmonary function, whereas the FEF25–75 dem -\\nonstrates much more intrapatient variability. Standards are \\nwidely available for most spirometric measures and allow for \\ncorrection based on the patient’s age, gender, race, and height. \\nThe FEV1/FVC ratio is an indicator of airflow obstruction and \\nmay be more sensitive in identifying airflow abnormalities in \\nasthma than the FEV1 is, as most children with asthma have an \\nFEV1 within the normal range, even in the presence of severe \\ndisease (see Chapter\\xa06). An effective asthma therapy should \\nlead to an improvement in, and ideally a normalization of, the \\nFEV1 and the FEV1/FVC ratio.\\nAn assessment of the level of asthma symptom control, \\nasthma-related morbidity as reflected by activity limita -\\ntion, and school absences should be an integral component \\nof every asthma visit. The frequency of rescue albuterol use \\nand how frequently a canister of albuterol needs to be refilled \\ndue to use of the contents of a canister (200 actuations = 100 \\ndoses) are effective surrogate indicators of asthma control. \\nThe effect on the clinical course caused when the patient \\nmisses a dose (or several doses) of medications often pro -\\nvides a valuable insight into the disease activity.\\nstep-down therapy\\nIf asthma is well controlled for a period of at least 3 months, \\nconsideration should be given to a step-down in therapy.1 \\nCircumstances that may preclude a step-down even in the \\nsetting of well-controlled asthma include the impending \\nexposure to a known trigger, such as the return to school or \\nan upcoming allergen or viral season, which has historically \\nbeen associated with declines in asthma control. The gen -\\neral approach for step-down is to reduce therapy one step at \\na time, although very little clinical trial evidence provides \\nguidance as to the best strategy for this approach or how best \\nto identify the patients who are most likely to tolerate a step-\\ndown without a deterioration in their asthma control.\\nstep-down to as-needed  adMInIstrat Ion \\nof Ics In chIldren  wIth MIld asthMa\\nAttention has recently been directed to the use of ICS therapy \\non an as-needed basis, with ICS being administered when -\\never children have asthma symptoms that require SABA res -\\ncue therapy.

This study suggests that \\namong school-age children with mild asthma that is well \\ncontrolled on low-dose ICS, the use of ICS as a rescue medi -\\ncation with albuterol might be an effective step-down strat -\\negy as it is more effective than albuterol alone and avoids \\nthe ICS-related growth effects seen with daily ICS therapy. \\nSimilarly, in a trial involving 276 children aged 1–4 years \\nwith frequent wheeze, daily treatment with ICS (beclometha -\\nsone 400 mcg twice daily) was superior to as-needed SABA \\nalone in terms of symptom-free days, SABA use, noctur -\\nnal awakenings, and time to first oral corticosteroid use.64 \\nHowever, there was no statistically significant difference in \\nthe outcomes between the as-needed ICS + SABA group \\n(beclomethasone 800 mcg each time albuterol was used) and \\nthe daily ICS group.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThe evidence supporting treatment decision making in chil -\\ndren with asthma has expanded substantially over the past \\ndecade. The optimal management of asthma entails con -\\ntinual reassessment, focusing on the appropriate recogni -\\ntion and classification of the disease severity and the level \\nof control, which will result in the minimization of asthma-\\nrelated impairment and risk. Using an approach to stepwise \\ncare, attention should be paid to the need for a step-up in \\ncare in the setting of suboptimal control as well as the poten -\\ntial step-down in care when disease control is achieved and \\nmaintained.\\nREFERENCES\\n 1.

She has never had a severe asthma \\nexacerbation or been hospitalized. Her mother, Anna, had \\nconsistently administered her daughter’s daily inhaled cor -\\nticosteroid. Anna was vigilant about monitoring Jessica’s \\nsymptoms until a year ago when Jessica started high school.\\nJessica has now started her sophomore year and has just \\nmade the basketball team. She leaves for school very early \\nin the morning and often misses dinner due to basketball \\npractice. On the weekends, she spends time with her friends. \\nBecause Jessica has been a straight-A student, her mother \\nbelieves that she is responsibly balancing school with extra -\\ncurricular activities. She assumes that Jessica is also taking \\nher asthma medications and is symptom-free as she is able \\nto participate in sports and has not complained of symptoms.\\nOne day, Anna receives a call from Jessica’s basketball \\ncoach telling her that Jessica is in an ambulance en route \\nto the local emergency department. He reports that while at \\npractice, Jessica started coughing, became short of breath, \\nand could barely speak. He also notes that Jessica has been \\ncoughing during practice since she had a cold 2 weeks previously and has had wheezing and shortness of breath \\non occasion, but she rests and the symptoms abate. At the \\nemergency department, Jessica is evaluated and treated for \\nstatus asthmaticus. She is admitted to the pediatric intensive \\ncare unit for further management.\\nWhen her condition improves, after repeated questioning \\nby the medical team, she casually acknowledges that with \\nher long days and rigorous schedule, she often forgets to take \\nher controller medication. Since she was feeling well and \\nwas able to succeed at basketball, she did not think much \\nabout missing the doses. In retrospect, Jessica recalls that \\nshe had noticed some increased nighttime cough, as well as \\ncough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath during bas -\\nketball practice, but she did not link this to her asthma. She \\nalso reported that while she has never smoked cigarettes, \\nher new group of friends smoke after practice. Although \\nthe smoke caused her to cough, she was too embarrassed to \\nleave for fear of being teased and left out. During the time \\nwhen she realized she needed albuterol, she was too embar -\\nrassed to take it in the presence of her peers.\\nJessica’s condition improves and she is ready for dis -\\ncharge.

Both Jessica and her mother \\nare left with many questions on how to manage Jessica’s \\nasthma at this stage in her development.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThe successful, ongoing treatment of asthma in adolescents \\npresents numerous challenges because adolescence is a time \\nof profound change. It is marked by the development of new \\ncognitive skills, independent decision making, and increased \\npeer pressure. Delivering effective care to reduce asthma \\nmorbidity and mortality in adolescence, and improve the \\nquality of life and health of adolescents with asthma requires \\nclinicians to have knowledge of the state-of-the-art asthma \\ncare as well as an understanding of the role that cognitive \\nand psychosocial development plays in asthma management \\nin this age group. To that end, this chapter reviews the epide -\\nmiology and natural history of asthma related to adolescents, \\ndiscusses appropriate clinical management and examines \\nhow the developmental features of adolescence affect self-\\nmanagement and the treatment of asthma.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nAdolescence is defined as individuals aged 11–21 years \\nand is divided into three age groups: (1) early adolescents \\n(11–14 years), (2) middle adolescents (15–17 years), and (3) \\nlate adolescents (18–21 years).1 In this chapter, we will focus \\non the early and middle adolescent age groups because their \\ndevelopment is distinctly different from younger children \\nand from older adolescents, whose behavior more closely \\nresembles adults.\\nCompared with children aged 0–10 years, early and mid -\\ndle adolescents have a higher asthma prevalence,2 ranging \\nfrom 12% to 17%.3,4 They also experience more frequent5 and \\nmore severe6 exacerbations, and have higher asthma-related \\nmortality rates.2 In fact, among youth, asthma-related deaths \\noccur most frequently during the teenage years, and a his -\\ntory of prior, severe exacerbations is a significant risk factor \\nfor fatal asthma.7 During early to mid-adolescence, the child -\\nhood trend that boys have higher rates of asthma than girls \\nis reversed with female adolescents having higher asthma \\nrates.8\\nDespite this increased morbidity and mortality, adolescents \\nhave fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations \\nfor asthma compared with their younger counterparts2; they \\nalso have fewer ambulatory care visits each year and, as a \\nresult, they receive less ongoing care where their symptoms \\nand lung function can be monitored.9 This suggests that even \\nin the face of significant complications from asthma, includ -\\ning persistent symptoms and severe exacerbations, patients \\nin this age group may not seek or receive the care they need, \\nwhich may be because they underrecognize their symptoms \\nand their relationship to worsening asthma,10 or because they \\nunderestimate the severity of their disease.11,12NATURAL HISTORY OF ASTHMA \\nIN ADOLESCENCE\\nThe commonly held notion that asthma “remits in adoles -\\ncence” is based on anecdotal clinical experience rather than \\nthe evidence from longitudinal cohort studies of children \\nwith asthma. While there are few studies documenting the \\nnatural history of asthma from childhood through adoles -\\ncence,13–15 these studies show that children with asthma are \\nat increased risk for the persistence of respiratory symptoms \\ninto adulthood. Because the hormonal, behavioral, and phys -\\nical changes that occur during adolescence can affect the \\ncourse of asthma, it is important to delineate the risk factors \\nassociated with asthma symptoms that persist as children get \\nolder.\\nIn a longitudinal birth cohort of children enrolled in the \\nTucson Children’s Respiratory Study, investigators demon -\\nstrated that 60% of children with asthma, defined as the pres -\\nence of frequent or continuous wheezing, prior to puberty, \\ncontinued to experience wheezing episodes during early \\nadolescence, and this persistence of the symptoms was due \\nto several prepubertal risk factors, including an elevated \\nbody mass index; the early onset of puberty (characterized \\nby voice change in males and menarche in females); and a \\nphysician diagnosis of sinusitis prior to the onset of puberty, \\nand allergic sensitization to Alternaria .13 Other studies have \\nreported similar factors.14–16\\nIn a longitudinal, population-based cohort study of \\nchildren, who were studied at age 6–8 years and again at \\nage 14–16 years, Withers et al. showed that greater than \\n50% of children with wheeze and more than one-third with \\ncough at age 6–8 years continued to have these symptoms \\ninto their teenage years.15 They demonstrated that a his -\\ntory of atopy was independently associated with persis -\\ntent asthma symptoms. Additionally, maternal asthma was \\nassociated with wheeze that persisted into adolescence for \\nfemales, but not males. The authors proposed that females \\nmay inherit genes associated with wheeze, and these \\ngenes may be expressed in later adolescence. This theory \\ncould explain the increased rate of asthma among female \\nadolescents.\\nOther significant risk factors that Withers et al. identi -\\nfied to explain the persistence of respiratory symptoms into \\nadolescence were active and passive smoking, particularly \\namong males.15 Regular, active smoking was strongly associ -\\nated with persistent wheeze. The investigators suggest that \\nthe adverse effect of passive smoking in early life on the \\nsmall caliber airways of males and the continued exposure of \\nthe airways through active smoking result in persistent cough \\nand late-onset wheeze.15\\nLow socioeconomic class has also been found to be asso -\\nciated with the persistence of asthma symptoms into adoles -\\ncence.17 Also, a negative association has been found between \\nthe number of children in a household and wheeze that per -\\nsists into adolescence.18 The mechanism responsible for this \\nrelationship is thought to be an immunologically mediated \\nprotective effect of increased exposure to viral infections ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 206}),\n"," Document(page_content='189 Management of Adolescent Asthma\\nin early childhood, which may prevent the proliferation of \\nT-helper type 2 (Th2) cells.18\\nWhen determining if asthma is in remission in an ado -\\nlescent patient, the absence of asthma symptoms or the lack \\nof need for asthma medications may not be sufficient deter -\\nminants of the patient’s asthma status.7 During periods of \\nclinical remission characterized by no asthma symptoms and \\nno use of inhaled corticosteroids, bronchial hyperresponsive -\\nness was tested and subjects were found to have subclinical \\nbut significant airway obstruction and airway inflammation. \\nThis suggests that some individuals who seem to be free of \\nasthma symptoms in fact have persistent asthma.19 Therefore, \\ncomplete remission includes an absence of asthma symp -\\ntoms and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, not needing to use \\ninhaled corticosteroids, and normal lung function.GUIDELINES FOR THE TREATMENT \\nOF ADOLESCENT ASTHMA\\nThe most recent guidelines from the Expert Panel Report 3 \\n(EPR-3) in the United States20 and the International Global \\nInitiative for Asthma21 guidelines emphasize the need to \\nachieve control of asthma symptoms, thereby reducing \\nimpairment and risk for future morbidity—all goals that \\nare most pertinent to the adolescent patient.

A key approach to reducing asthma \\nsymptoms is to select a medication regimen corresponding to \\nthe highest level of asthma severity for the patient, and once \\ntheir asthma symptoms, lung function, and activity levels \\nare optimized, step down the therapy to the least amount of medicine required to maintain adequate asthma control and \\nto reduce medication side effects.

To accomplish these goals, it is recommended \\nthat the adolescent meet with the clinician without the \\nparents present at the beginning of the visit. This allows \\nadolescent patients to assume more control and take more \\nresponsibility for their asthma management. The parents \\nshould be brought in at the end of the visit to review the plan \\ntogether so that they can support the patient’s efforts. The \\nplan should encompass goals that personally benefit the ado -\\nlescent, such as looking and feeling better (self-image), fully \\nparticipating in physical activities and organized sports, and \\nreducing symptoms when around friends (peer acceptance). \\nThese types of rewards are important to adolescent patients, \\nand achieving asthma control provides positive feedback \\nthat reinforces their efforts.\\nADOLESCENTS WHO DO NOT \\nRESPOND TO THERAPY\\nAsthma is characterised by obstruction, hyperresponsive -\\nness, and inflammation of the airways that is at least par -\\ntially reversible. The symptoms may occur episodically. \\nAdditionally, alternative diagnoses should be excluded. \\nAlthough patients with asthma present in different ways, \\nmost share common clinical and historical features that \\nsupport the diagnosis. The use of lung function measure -\\nments, bronchial challenges, exercise challenges, and \\nallergy skin tests to support the diagnosis is helpful, and \\nin some cases it is necessary. Adolescent patients often \\ndescribe symptoms of chest tightness with colds, chest \\ncongestion, and bronchitis. The symptoms occur more \\noften at night and in the early morning hours, and improve \\nthroughout the day.11 However, because many adolescents \\neither deny their symptoms, or they underestimate or are \\nunaware of the severity of their symptoms, the respiratory \\nproblem may not be diagnosed or, if it is diagnosed, it may \\nbe undertreated.7\\nFor some adolescents, their history, clinical findings, \\nresponse to therapy, and ancillary test results are inconsis -\\ntent with a diagnosis of asthma. In these cases, alternative diagnoses should be considered, including cystic fibrosis, \\nprimary ciliary dyskinesia, immunodeficiency, and congeni -\\ntal heart disease.11 Special attention should be given to vocal \\ncord dysfunction (VCD) and habit-cough syndrome in this \\npopulation.\\nVCD is a condition characterized by paradoxical closure \\nof the vocal cords that can result in wheezing and shortness \\nof breath during the respiratory cycle,22 and can be mistaken \\nfor asthma or may coexist with it. It is more common in ado -\\nlescent females and has been seen in elite athletes.23,24 It is \\nsometimes associated with social stressors, such as anxiety \\nassociated with participating in high-performance or com -\\npetitive sports.24 Patients with VCD exhibit loud wheezing \\nover the trachea, they often have supraglottic retractions and \\ncomplain of chest tightness. Despite the wheezing, patients \\nwith VCD have a poor response to bronchodilators and their \\noxygen saturations are usually normal.11 Diagnostic stud -\\nies during an acute episode include: (1) spirometry, which \\nmay demonstrate a flat inspiratory loop of the flow volume \\ncurve; and (2) flexible laryngoscopy, which may demonstrate \\nadduction of the vocal cords during phonation. These find -\\nings are frequently absent when patients are asymptomatic.11 \\nThe treatment of VCD focuses on the relaxation of the vocal \\ncords, which can be taught by a speech pathologist or a psy -\\nchologist with training in behavior modification. The accu -\\nrate diagnosis and treatment of VCD can reduce morbidity, \\nprevent the inappropriate use of inhaled corticosteroids, and \\nimprove patients’ quality of life.23\\nAnother disorder that is commonly mistaken for asthma \\nin adolescents is habit-cough syndrome.25 A habit cough usu -\\nally begins during an upper respiratory illness, and persists \\nafter the acute illness has resolved. The cough in this syn -\\ndrome is distinctive in that it is generally loud, barky, repeti -\\ntive, abrasive, and attracts considerable attention. It is highly \\ndisruptive to both patients and families. The characteristic \\nfinding in habit-cough syndrome is the cessation of the cough \\nduring sleep as well as when patients believe that they are not \\nunder observation, which helps to differentiate habit-cough \\nsyndrome from other etiologies.11,25 Appropriate behavioral \\nintervention is the treatment of choice and includes sugges -\\ntion therapy,25 self-hypnosis,26 and using a tightly wrapped \\nbedsheet around the patient’s chest combined with sugges -\\ntion therapy.27 These treatments distract the patient from the \\ncough, and serve to reassure the patient that he or she can \\nbreak the coughing cycle.\\nGENDER DIFFERENCES IN ASTHMA \\nSELF-MANAGEMENT\\nGender differences have been observed in two groups of \\nurban, early adolescents, with males more likely to engage in \\nasthma prevention.28,29 Among Latino and African American \\nurban youth aged 11–14 years, males took more steps than \\nfemales to prevent having asthma symptoms, including \\nusing controller medications.28 A similar finding was dem -\\nonstrated in a sample of early adolescent African Americans ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 210}),\n"," Document(page_content='193 Management of Adolescent Asthma\\nfrom Detroit, of which males were more likely to take pre -\\nventative medications, and were more comfortable doing so \\nin the presence of their peers.29 As clinicians teach adoles -\\ncents about asthma management, it may be useful to consider \\nthese gender differences. While females are more likely to \\nemploy social skills that focus on communal goals, incor -\\nporating cooperation and relationship enhancement with \\ntheir peers,30 this does not necessarily translate into better \\nself-management.\\nADOLESCENT ASTHMA MANAGEMENT: \\nDEVELOPMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nThe developmental changes that define adolescence present \\nunique opportunities as well as challenges to asthma man -\\nagement. Clinicians should consider these developmental \\nchanges when guiding the adolescent through asthma self-\\nmanagement. In this section, we focus on cognitive devel -\\nopment, expansion of domain knowledge, peer relations, \\nautonomy, risk-taking behavior, identity development, as \\nwell as the process of transitioning responsibility from par -\\nents to patients.\\ncogn ItIve develop Ment\\nAbstract Thinking\\nOver time, adolescents develop formal operational think -\\ning, which encompasses the skills of abstract thinking, logi -\\ncal reasoning, and problem solving.31 Unlike children, who \\ncannot think beyond the observable, adolescents can think \\nabstractly, reflect upon their thoughts, and develop solutions \\naccordingly. The hallmarks of asthma are chronic airway \\ninflammation and bronchoconstriction. With more sophisti -\\ncated thinking, adolescents are able to understand inflamma -\\ntion, something that they cannot necessarily see or feel. They \\ncan also begin to link the sensation of chest tightness to the \\nconcept of airway constriction. Moreover, they can differenti -\\nate between rescue medications and daily anti-inflammatory \\nmedications, and understand the role of each. Although early \\nadolescents may not be ready to assume responsibility for \\ntaking daily medication,30 clinicians should begin to teach \\nthem about the pathophysiology of asthma and how broncho -\\ndilators and anti-inflammatory medications work.\\nIntegration of Past, Present, and Future\\nAdolescents develop the ability to integrate the past, the pres -\\nent, and the future,32 which enables them to reflect on cur -\\nrent and prior beliefs and memories. As a result, they can \\nunderstand the concept of chronicity as it relates to asthma, \\nrecognizing that asthma is a disorder that they may continue \\nto experience in the future. When placed in the context of \\nasthma treatment, this insight may help them to work with \\nclinicians to develop long-term goals for the prevention of \\nasthma symptoms. As adolescents experience the physical \\nlimitations caused by uncontrolled asthma, they may rec -\\nognize that the prevention of these limitations may lead to physical well-being and better performance now as well as \\nin the future. The perspective of asthma as a chronic dis -\\nease that may persist into the future but can be currently con -\\ntrolled may promote the avoidance of specific triggers.\\nDecision-Making Skills\\nA greater working memory capacity and the ability to \\nemploy more problem-solving strategies33 are keys to self-\\nmanagement in asthma. An improved working memory \\nmeans, in part, that adolescents can consider multiple fac -\\ntors simultaneously and act accordingly. Together, these \\ncognitive gains lead to more refined decision-making skills, \\nenabling them to assess and respond to symptoms and situ -\\nations that vary over time. Adolescents are able to under -\\nstand and use treatment plans that require stepping up or \\nstepping down medications in response to changes in symp -\\ntoms, peak flow, or exposure to specific triggers.34 Similarly, \\ndecision-making skills are necessary to help adolescents \\nnegotiate social situations that could impair their health. For \\nexample, when in the presence of peers who are smoking \\nor when faced with the pressure to smoke actively, adoles -\\ncents with asthma must weigh the social benefits of staying \\nin the situation knowing that the smoke will exacerbate their \\nasthma symptoms versus leaving their group of peers and \\nrisk separation from the group. Under these types of circum -\\nstances, it is important for clinicians to recognize that highly \\nstressful or emotionally charged situations may hinder good \\ndecision making in adolescents.1 This underscores the need \\nfor continuous monitoring by clinicians and the supportive \\nguidance of parents, particularly in the early stages of the \\nburgeoning independence of adolescents.\\nMetacognition\\nAn individual’s awareness of and control over the way that \\nhe or she processes information is referred to as metacog -\\nnition.1 One acquires a set of strategies and compares their \\nrelative efficacy across different situations. Metacognition \\nfacilitates self-regulation, which is the process by which one \\ncan observe, judge, and react to one’s actions.35 Asthma self-\\nregulation is crucial in achieving and maintaining adequate \\nasthma control.36 One of the most important skills in asthma \\nmanagement is recognizing changes in symptoms or peak \\nflow, and instituting early and appropriate therapy to reduce \\nasthma morbidity. Patients can reflect on their actions, deter -\\nmine if their perceptions were accurate, and if their response \\nproduced the desired effect.

Through \\nscience and health courses taken in school, adolescents \\nacquire domain-specific knowledge about the human body \\nand how it functions. When the pathophysiology and man -\\nagement of asthma are introduced, the adolescent with \\nknowledge of physiology and anatomy will be better able \\nto incorporate these concepts and apply that knowledge to \\nmanaging asthma.34\\npeer relat Ions\\nTeenagers spend increased time with their peers, and the \\nnature of these relationships changes such that peer groups \\nincrease in size and diversity, and friendships become more \\nintense.37 The awareness of oneself as a social being is a \\nprominent feature of adolescence, and has consequences \\nand effects on social behavior.38 Adolescents with asthma \\nare often concerned that having asthma will decrease their \\npeer acceptance. Socially stressful experiences, when not \\naddressed appropriately, can lead to poor decision mak -\\ning. Many adolescents believe that people are constantly \\nwatching them and that they are the center of attention \\nwhen this may not be so. This objectification of one -\\nself may be an impediment to asthma self-management. \\nAlthough adolescents may be cognizant of their symp -\\ntoms, they may be reluctant to take medication or avoid \\nasthma triggers for fear that their peers may witness or \\nquestion their behavior. As a result, even though the ado -\\nlescent has an asthma plan and knows how to respond to \\nsymptoms appropriately, the social milieu may still result \\nin medication nonadherence.\\nFour strategies that early adolescents use to cope with peer-\\nrelated stress in asthma management have been described: \\n(1) cognitive justifying—rationalizing the asthma manage -\\nment behavior to oneself regardless of a nonsupportive peer-\\nrelated environment; (2) explaining—describing asthma to \\npeers so that they understand why the adolescent needs to \\ncarry out asthma management behaviors; (3) outsourcing—\\nseeking social support to buffer or influence nonsupportive \\npeer-related environments, which involves having a close \\nfriend act or speak out on the adolescent’s behalf; and (4) \\nundisclosing—keeping asthma management behaviors pri -\\nvate or lying about the behaviors if they are not supported by \\npeers.39 These coping strategies are not mutually exclusive, \\nand adolescents use a mix of strategies to cope with their \\npeers.\\nClinicians can assist the adolescent by discussing the \\nissues of social stress and peer relations as they relate to \\nasthma management directly with the adolescent and his or \\nher parents, exploring how the treatment can be modified to fit \\nthe adolescent’s life, and guiding them through coping strate -\\ngies that will promote healthy asthma self-management. Peer \\nsupport is crucial if chronic illnesses such as asthma are to \\nbe managed successfully.Increased  autono My and separat Ion froM parents\\nAs adolescents develop autonomy and begin the process of \\nseparation from their parents, conflict may ensue. The pat -\\ntern of adolescent–parent conflict varies over time, with \\nearly adolescence marked by the most conflict, and late ado -\\nlescence by the least conflict.37 For adolescents with asthma, \\none potential source of conflict is autonomy with medical \\nmanagement. As they strive for autonomy and indepen -\\ndence, adolescents may begin to resent parental reminders \\nabout taking their asthma medications and consider it nag -\\nging, which leads to the avoidance of taking medication.40 \\nClinicians are encouraged to work with both adolescents \\nand their parents to assist in gradually transferring the \\nresponsibility of taking medication to the adolescent in a \\nway that is consistent with the teenager’s level of asthma \\nknowledge, maturation, and development. Since adolescents \\nspend increased time outside the home and parents may not \\nbe fully aware of their child’s symptoms, clinicians should \\nspend the first part of the visit with the adolescent, eliciting \\na history of symptoms, medication use, and trigger avoid -\\nance techniques before engaging in a joint discussion with \\nthe parents.\\nrIsK-taKIng In adolescents\\nRisk-taking behaviors, such as tobacco, alcohol, and drug \\nuse, increase during adolescence.10 Among adolescents with \\nasthma, the prevalence of smoking is equivalent to41 or even \\nhigher than those without asthma.42 Teenagers with asthma \\nwho actively smoke or who have passive smoke exposure \\nhave more asthma symptoms,43 are more likely to be admit -\\nted to hospital and require critical care interventions, such as \\nintubation for asthma exacerbations,44 and have suboptimal \\nlung growth and reduced lung function.45\\nIt is suggested that clinicians ask the adolescent about \\nhis or her smoking exposures and behaviors, and provide \\nappropriate counseling regarding the specific asthma-related \\ndangers associated with smoking. Moreover, they should rec -\\nommend antismoking interventions, or refer the patient to \\nan appropriate smoking cessation program. Additionally, it \\nis important to inquire about exposure to smoke not only in \\nthe home, but also in vehicles and in other places where the \\nadolescent may frequent. Reviewing the strategies to avoid \\nexposure is also recommended, including possible smoking \\ncessation programs for parents and other family members \\nwho may smoke.\\nIDENTITY DEVELOPMENT\\nIdentity formation is a lifelong process that peaks during \\nadolescence when teenagers are confronted with multiple \\nsocial and biological challenges. In order to cope with these \\nchallenges, adolescents must maintain a stable sense of self \\nacross different roles and responsibilities.46 Adolescents \\nwith chronic medical conditions, including asthma, bear \\nan additional burden in that they must incorporate an ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 212}),\n"," Document(page_content='195 Management of Adolescent Asthma\\nadditional challenge in their quest for identity formation—\\nthat of being a person with a chronic illness. Once adoles -\\ncents accept the illness as part of who they are, they may \\nunderstand that taking care of their disease is an integral \\ncomponent of taking care of themselves.34 In contrast, the \\ndevelopment of a sickly identity may contribute to low self-\\nesteem and poor self-image, and result in increased nonad -\\nherence and morbidity. The challenge for clinicians is to \\nhelp adolescent patients to create a self-concept of a strong \\nindividual who is empowered to confront and manage a \\nchronic illness.\\nIMPROVING ADHERENCE\\nAdherence can be defined as taking medications, monitoring \\ndisease progress, and incorporating lifestyle changes that are \\nconsistent with medical and health advice to achieve opti -\\nmum health outcomes.47 In adolescents with asthma, medica -\\ntion adherence, particularly inhaled corticosteroids, has been \\nestimated to be 50%.48 Studies on adherence in adolescents \\nhave consistently noted four specific barriers: (1) negative \\nperceptions about treatments and providers, (2) cognitive dif -\\nficulty in following medical instructions due to limited intel -\\nlectual abilities or forgetfulness, (3) social barriers due to \\npeer pressure, and (4) underestimation of asthma symptoms \\nand minimization of the consequences of nonadherence.49 \\nDespite this, clinicians can take steps to help adolescents \\nimprove their adherence.\\nGRADUAL TRANSITIONING OF \\nASTHMA CARE TO ADOLESCENTS\\nThe developmental changes previously described suggest that \\nearly adolescents are ready to begin assuming responsibility \\nfor their asthma care. However, the transfer from parents to \\nteenagers should be done gradually and monitored closely \\nby both clinicians and parents, as asthma management by \\nearly adolescents is often suboptimal.30 This highlights the \\nimportant role that clinicians play as teachers, coaches, and \\nsupporters of adolescent patients with asthma and their fami -\\nlies. They can facilitate this process of transition for families \\nby providing appropriate asthma education for adolescents \\nand by teaching parents how to monitor asthma care that will \\nensure the safety of the patient. A strong partnership among \\nall three parties—the adolescent patient, his or her parents, \\nand his or her clinician—will promote and support the teen -\\nager’s independence while ensuring that the level of responsi -\\nbility is tailored to the adolescent’s level of development and \\nasthma management skills.30\\nFORMING A THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE \\nWITH ADOLESCENT PATIENTS\\nEffective communication and a patient–clinician alliance are \\ncritical aspects of successful medical care. There is a posi -\\ntive relationship between a therapeutic alliance and treatment adherence. Research on the communication between physi -\\ncians and adolescents with chronic illness has demonstrated \\nthat a relationship viewed as equal between the patient and the \\nclinician is crucial to delivering effective care. Adolescents \\nexpressed that the use of age-appropriate language, an \\nemphasis on the individual rather than on the disease, and \\na patient-focused rather than a parent-focused discussion \\ncontributed to their overall feeling of being a respected \\npartner, rather than an ignored bystander in their care.50 \\nThe\\xa0establishment of a secure and trusting relationship is the \\nfoundation for open communication, which is essential when \\ndiscussing sensitive matters, such as risk-taking behavior and \\npeer relationships.\\nSUMMARY\\nThe management of asthma in adolescents is a complex \\nundertaking, which requires clinicians’ awareness of medi -\\ncal therapies and sophisticated diagnostic tests, as well as a \\ndeep understanding of the psychosocial changes that ado -\\nlescents experience. As knowledge of these intricate issues \\nincreases, clinicians can work with adolescent patients and \\ntheir families to help the adolescent live a healthy, active, and \\nsymptom-free life.\\nREFERENCES\\n 1.

A spi -\\nrometry revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) \\nof 1.23 L (45% predicted), a forced vital capacity (FVC) of \\n2.08 L (62% predicted), and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.59. She \\nreceived bronchodilator treatment with four puffs of alb -\\nuterol and her FEV1 improved to 1.52 (55% predicted), indi -\\ncating significant reversibility. The patient was assessed as \\nhaving severe asthma, allergic rhinitis, and conjunctivitis.\\nThe patient was treated with prednisone 40 mg orally \\nevery morning for 7 days; Advair 250/50 (fluticasone/sal -\\nmeterol) one puff twice daily; and fluticasone nasal spray \\ntwo sprays in each nostril once per day, and continuation \\nof loratadine.\\nOne week later, she returned to the clinic and had a \\nmarked decrease in her asthma symptoms. She denied any \\ncoughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest tightness. \\nShe was able to sleep through the night. Her physical exami -\\nnation was positive for a slight decrease in air movement \\nbilaterally on auscultation of the lungs, but was otherwise \\nunremarkable. A spirometry revealed an FEV1 of 2.26 L \\n(76% predicted), a FVC of 2.75 L (69% predicted), and an \\nFEV1/FVC ratio of 0.88. Her exhaled nitric oxide level was \\n29 ppb. The patient was treated with Advair 500/50 one puff \\ntwice daily, prednisone was discontinued, and the remain -\\nder of her medications remained the same.\\nThe patient was seen 6 weeks later, and at that time she \\nindicated that her breathing was better than it had been in \\nthe last 4 years. Her ACT was 25. She had only used her res -\\ncue inhaler once in the previous 6 weeks and she denied any \\ndaytime or nocturnal symptoms. Her physical examination \\nwas unremarkable with clear lung fields. Her spirometry \\nrevealed an FEV1 of 2.48 L (84% of predicted).\\nThis case illustrates several important points.\\n 1. The importance of spirometry in diagnosing and \\nassessing the severity of asthma. This patient \\nnever had a spirometry prior to her initial visit \\nto the clinic. If a spirometry had been obtained \\nwhen she was first prescribed albuterol, the diag -\\nnosis and the assessment of her asthma severity \\ncould have been made sooner, thereby preventing \\nthe marked impairment and risk factors that she \\npresented.\\n 2. The utility of the Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3) \\nasthma classification for judging asthma sever -\\nity and guiding therapy decisions, including the \\nassessment of impairment using standardized \\npatient questionnaires such as the ACT.\\n 3. The potential utility of exhaled nitric oxide in \\nassessing lung inflammation and responsiveness \\nto corticosteroids. This patient presented with a very high exhaled nitric oxide that was significantly \\nlower after just 1 week of treatment with oral and \\ninhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Typically, higher \\nexhaled nitric oxide levels occur with an eosino -\\nphilic asthma phenotype, which tends to respond \\nbetter to corticosteroids.\\n 4. The overuse of albuterol associated with uncon -\\ntrolled asthma. Patients using as much albuterol as \\nthis patient reported are at a higher risk for cata -\\nstrophic asthma events.\\n 5. The utility of oral corticosteroid and ICS to quickly \\nreduce the symptoms of asthma and improve spi -\\nrometry and lower lung inflammation as assessed \\nby exhaled nitric oxide.\\n 6. The utility of spirometry and ACT to monitor con -\\ntrol in patients.\\n 7. Appropriate treatment can considerably improve \\nthe quality of life for patients and reverse many of \\nthe impairments and risk factors.\\nOVERVIEW\\nAsthma is an inflammatory airway disease, with a compli -\\ncated pathophysiology and is multifactorial in etiology. The \\nonset of the disease can occur at any time during a person’s \\nlifetime, but it commonly occurs in childhood or early ado -\\nlescence. According to data from the United States Centers \\nfor Disease Control, the disease burden has been on the rise \\nfor the past 20 years. In the United Sates, asthma prevalence \\nincreased from 7.3% in 2001 to 8.4% in 2010, an increase of \\n25.7 million persons.1 Approximately 3800 deaths per year \\nare from asthma and asthma has been a contributing factor in \\nanother 7000 deaths per year. In adults, asthma is the fourth \\nleading cause of work absenteeism and results in almost $3 \\nbillion per year in lost productivity.

These symptoms tend to be episodic in nature with \\nnear complete remission between episodes in many cases. \\nAtypical presentations can occur in adults, including dyspnea \\non exertion. It is important to keep in mind the following \\ndifferential diagnoses, since these disorders can present with \\nsimilar signs and symptoms: chronic obstructive pulmonary \\ndisease (COPD; emphysema and chronic bronchitis); pul -\\nmonary embolism; mechanical obstruction of the upper or \\nlower airways (malignant and benign tumors); obstructive \\nsleep apnea (OSA); vocal cord dysfunction; tracheomalacia; ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 216}),\n"," Document(page_content='199 Management of Adult Asthma\\ncongestive heart failure; herpetic tracheobronchitis; hyper -\\nventilation with panic attacks; cough due to angiotensin \\nconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; and pulmonary infil -\\ntration with eosinophilia. In patients with difficult-to-control \\nasthma, comorbid conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux \\ndisease (GERD), rhinosinusitis, OSA, obesity, and allergic \\nbronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) should be recog -\\nnized early and adequately treated. The triggers for wors -\\nening asthma should be documented, and include allergens, \\nirritants (e.g., environmental and tobacco smoke), respiratory \\nviruses, and medications (beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors). \\nEach clinic visit should include an evaluation of asthma con -\\ntrol, self-management skills, adherence, and the success of \\npharmacotherapy. A questionnaire encompassing various \\nsymptoms, duration, frequency, and severity can be used.\\nA physical examination during routine visits might not \\nyield much, but it is useful in recognizing an exacerbation \\nand in identifying comorbid conditions. On nasopharyngeal \\nexamination, there could be increased induration and ery -\\nthema in the nasal turbinates and cobblestoning in the ret -\\nropharynx from a postnasal drip in patients with chronic \\nrhinosinusitis. On lung examination, patients can have wheez -\\ning, prolonged end-expiration, and decreased air movement. \\nPatients could also present with a normal lung examination. \\nA silent chest may actually indicate a severe exacerbation.\\nIn the initial evaluation of new onset of asthma symptoms \\nin adults, a chest x-ray should be done to rule out other etiolo -\\ngies of dyspnea. In asthma, the chest x-ray is usually within \\nnormal limits or occasionally shows hyperinflation and air \\ntrapping from mucus plugs. No further imaging studies are \\nrequired for evaluating asthma.\\nSpirometry is an integral part of assessing asthma severity \\nand control. Spirometry should be performed prior to initiat -\\ning treatment in order to establish the presence and sever -\\nity of baseline airway obstruction. The initial spirometry \\nshould also include measurements before and after inhala -\\ntion of a short-acting bronchodilator to assess reversibility. \\nSpirometry is generally recommended over measurements \\nby a peak flow meter. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) meters are \\nmore appropriate for monitoring than they are as diagnostic \\ntools; however, a home PEF diary may be helpful in diag -\\nnosing patients with a suggestive history of asthma when the \\nlung function is normal in the clinic. The ratio of FEV1/FVC \\nis typically less than 70%. The FEV1 is characteristically \\nlow in asthma. Reversibility is defined as a 12% improve -\\nment and an increase of 200 cc in FEV1 in comparison to \\nthe baseline. Spirometry should be done to determine airflow \\nobstruction and should be matched with the symptom profile. \\nMany patients do not perceive airway obstruction; therefore, \\nspirometry is especially useful in this population. There are \\nguidelines for the technique and the equipment to be used \\nwhile performing office spirometry.2,3 Patient age, gender, \\nheight, and ethnic background should be taken into account \\nwhen interpreting the results. In patients with a normal spi -\\nrometry, airway hyperresponsiveness can be assessed using \\nmethacholine or mannitol bronchoprovocation challenge \\ntesting. A positive bronchoprovocation test does not confirm the diagnosis of asthma. Normal subjects without asthma, \\npatients with rhinitis or COPD, and others may sometimes \\nhave a positive test. However, a negative test excludes the \\ndiagnosis of asthma, except in patients with a high pretest \\nprobability of asthma.\\nLaboratory testing is generally not helpful in the diag -\\nnosis or management of asthma. Total immunoglobulin E \\n(IgE) can be elevated or normal, but population studies indi -\\ncate a higher probability of airway hyperresponsiveness and \\nasthma with elevated IgE levels.4 Elevated blood eosinophil \\nlevels are not diagnostic for asthma but are predictive of bet -\\nter responses to ICS.5\\nAll patients with persistent asthma are recommended for \\nan evaluation of allergens as possible contributing factors, \\nespecially perennial allergens. This can be done through \\nskin or in vitro  testing. Allergies are significant triggers for \\nasthma in ≥80% of children and 50%–60% of adults.\\nExhaled nitric oxide can be helpful in certain instances. \\nRecent guidelines6 indicate that it can be used to assist in \\nassessing the etiology of respiratory symptoms; to help in \\nidentifying the eosinophilic asthma phenotype; to assess the \\npotential response or failure to respond to anti-inflammatory \\nagents, notably corticosteroids; to establish a baseline dur -\\ning clinical stability for subsequent monitoring of persistent \\nasthma; to guide changes in doses of anti-inflammatory \\nmedications: step-down dosing, step-up dosing, or discon -\\ntinuation of anti-inflammatory medications; to assist in the \\nevaluation of adherence to anti-inflammatory medications; \\nand to assess whether airway inflammation is contributing to \\npoor asthma control.\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ASTHMA\\nThe initial step in the management of asthma is to accu -\\nrately assess the patient and to classify the patient based \\non the severity of the symptoms.7 Classification is based on \\nan assessment of the impairment domain, which includes \\nthe duration, frequency, and severity of the symptoms and \\nlung function, and the risk domain, which includes the \\npresence and frequency of acute exacerbations (Figures \\n19.1 and 19.2).\\nSeverit y\\nUnderlying intensity\\nof dise ase pretreatmen t\\nImpairment Risk\\n• Frequenc y of symptoms\\n• Intensity of symptoms\\n• Me asures of lung f unction\\n• Functional limitations\\n• Impairment currently or   recently ex perienced• Likelih ood of fu ture\\n   exacerbations or impairment• Histor y of exacerbations\\n• Likelih ood of prog ressive\\n   lung f unction de cline\\nFIGURE 19.1  Asthma disease severity.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 217}),\n"," Document(page_content='200 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\ndefInItIons\\nSeverity is the intrinsic intensity of the disease process that \\nis measured before receiving long-term control therapy. \\nControl is the degree to which asthma’s manifestations are \\nminimized and the goals of therapy are met.\\nAs rapid-acting bronchodilating medications are used by \\npatients to control their symptoms, the domain of respon -\\nsiveness can be assessed by evaluating the frequency of res -\\ncue inhaler use, the duration of relief of symptoms, and the \\nextent of relief from symptoms. A deterioration of asthma \\ncontrol should be suspected if there is increased frequency \\nof use, incomplete relief of symptoms, and shorter duration \\nof symptom relief.8 An awareness of the symptoms and self-\\nmanagement of the disease are essential to decrease the num -\\nber of exacerbations, to increase exercise tolerance, and to \\nimprove quality of life.

They help diminish airway hyperresponsiveness \\nand decrease lung inflammation.9 Corticosteroids can be \\nadministered via different routes: inhaled, oral, intramuscu -\\nlar, or intravenous. There is an increased bioavailability of \\nICS, requiring lower doses and thus lowering the incidence \\nof adverse reactions with their usage. Local adverse effects \\ninclude oral candidiasis, dysphonia (seen in higher doses and \\nin vocal stress), reflex cough, and bronchospasm (from the \\nfaster rate of inhalation). Oral candidiasis and dysphonia can \\nbe controlled by washing the mouth after each use and by \\nusing a spacer. Severe and difficult-to-control asthma war -\\nrants the possibility of using oral corticosteroids for long-term \\nsymptom control. However, there are many other options \\nand the risk/benefit ratio of placing a patient on prolonged \\noral corticosteroids must be carefully weighed. Systemic \\nside effects, seen more commonly with the prolonged use of \\noral corticosteroids, include cushingoid features associated \\nwith adrenal gland suppression, hypertension, uncontrolled \\nblood sugars, cataracts, a fatty liver, and proximal muscle \\nweakness.7 Chronic usage can suppress immunity and may \\nincrease the risk of infection and cause the potential reactiva -\\ntion of tuberculosis.\\nCorticosteroid insensitivity or a variation in sensitivity is \\na result of various molecular mechanisms and the prepon -\\nderance varies in different patient phenotypes.

Omalizumab decreases the Fc ɛRI expres -\\nsion on basophils, mast cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and \\nairway submucosal cells. It is recommended as an adjunc -\\ntive therapy for patients with perennial allergies and those \\nwho have moderate to severe persistent asthma.

It is believed \\nto work by reducing the airway smooth muscle mass. While \\nthere has been no decrease in airway hyperresponsiveness \\nor an improvement in FEV1, there has been a significant \\nimprovement in patients’ quality of life. Most studies are \\ndone on patients with no more than three exacerbations per \\nyear and the very strict inclusion criteria mean that this inter -\\nvention might not be applicable to all patients.\\nEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT\\nThe evaluation of an acute exacerbation of asthma starts with \\na history. Recent multiple emergency room visits and current \\noral corticosteroids may indicate an exacerbation that has \\nbecome refractory to outpatient management, mandating a \\nhospital admission. A previous exacerbation leading to respi -\\nratory failure requiring intubation and ventilator support or \\nan attack that has previously caused seizures may indicate \\nthat the disease has progressed to severe uncontrolled asthma \\n(see Chapters 21 and 22).\\nA rapid assessment should be completed for those who \\nrequire immediate intervention. A severe attack may be sug -\\ngested by the patient’s difficulty in completing sentences and \\ndiaphoresis. Respiratory distress at rest can present with using \\nthe accessory muscles of respiration, an increased respiratory \\nrate of >28, and tachycardia. Impending respiratory failure \\ncould present as a depressed respiratory effort, a paroxysmal \\ndiaphragmatic movement, and alternating abdominal and \\nribcage breathing.\\nThe severity of an attack cannot be clearly assessed by the \\nintensity of wheezing and sometimes a fatal attack can pres -\\nent without any wheezing and with only silent lung sounds \\non auscultation. Pulsus paradoxus is another indicator of the \\nseverity of the disease. An altered mental status in a patient \\nwith an acute exacerbation may require intubation.\\nIf possible, spirometry should be done to assess the sever -\\nity of the airway obstruction and to determine if admission \\nis needed. A FEV1 of <30% of predicted values ( <1 L) or \\na FEV1 showing a <40% improvement after 1 h of vigor -\\nous bronchodilator therapy is an indication for admission \\ninto hospital. A laboratory evaluation should be focused on \\nfinding the cause of the exacerbation and also on an assess -\\nment of severity. A complete blood count should be done to \\nexclude any infectious processes. A chest x-ray should be \\nobtained to rule out other causes of dyspnea and respiratory \\ndistress if suspected. The arterial blood gases should be con -\\nsidered if there is a severe attack. Hospitalization is required \\nif PaO2 is <60 mmHg. PaCO2 may initially be low due to an \\nincreased respiratory rate, and later increase as the patient \\nbegins to fatigue and go into respiratory distress, which \\nmight necessitate the need for intubation. Management con -\\nsists of intensive bronchodilator therapy, oxygen, and sys -\\ntemic corticosteroids. Approximately one-third of patients \\nin the emergency department (ED) might show no broncho -\\ndilator response to albuterol. This unresponsiveness could be \\nsecondary to an increased airway inflammation, a distortion \\nof the airways, and the presence of mucus in the airways. Spirometry is warranted in the ED and a decision regard -\\ning admission could be made sooner based on response or \\nno-response to albuterol inhalation after 30 and 60 min. In \\naccordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \\nguidelines, responders could potentially be discharged from \\nthe ED.20 Patients who have an intermediate response to \\nalbuterol, defined as persistent symptoms of dyspnea and a \\nFEV1 between 50% and 70% of predicted, should be consid -\\nered for hospital admission.20\\nEven though there are several complications associated \\nwith mechanical ventilation, such as barotrauma, hypoten -\\nsion, and infections, it can be lifesaving in patients with \\nsevere exacerbations. Identifying the precipitating cause of \\nthe exacerbation is the next step after stabilizing the patient, \\nin order to dictate the most appropriate immediate and pro -\\nphylactic therapies.\\nTHERAPY DECISION PARADIGMS\\nThe asthma guidelines provide the basis for medical decision-\\nmaking in treating patients. However, the therapy for each \\npatient must be individualized. Moreover, there are alterna -\\ntive therapies listed under each category of asthma severity \\nand asthma control in Figure 19.4. How does one make an \\nappropriate choice? The following are some data to help with \\nthe decision-making process.\\nIn patients with mild persistent asthma, the guidelines \\nlist low-dose ICS as the preferred choice. Several alterna -\\ntives are listed, but only LTRA are commonly used. What \\ndo the data say?  \\nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and \\nthe Global Initiatives for Asthma (GINA) guidelines as well \\nas Cochrane analyses all support the use of low-dose ICS \\nover LTRAs. However, some patients are placed on a com -\\nbination inhaler with ICS plus LABA. Although this will \\nimprove their asthma, it is frequently not necessary or rec -\\nommended. In the OPTIMA trial, patients were randomized \\nto budesonide versus budesonide at the same dose and for -\\nmoterol or a placebo for 1 year. The patients had mild disease \\nand were corticosteroid-free at baseline. After 1 year, the rate \\nof severe exacerbations was equivalent for the combination \\ntherapy versus ICS monotherapy.21\\nAnother decision that physicians often face is when and \\nwhich controller medications can be stopped in mild persistent \\nasthma patients who are well controlled. This was addressed \\nin the salmeterol or corticosteroids (SOCS) trial published \\nin 2001.22 In this study, patients with mild persistent asthma \\nwho were well controlled on ICS were randomized to con -\\ntinued treatment with ICS, salmeterol alone, or a placebo. \\nPatients on ICS did much better than either of the other two \\ngroups. These data suggested that some patients might need \\ncontinued long-term controller therapy and that salmeterol \\nmonotherapy should not be used in patients with chronic per -\\nsistent asthma.\\nIndeed, because of the controversy surrounding the poten -\\ntial deleterious effect of LABAs, both the asthma guidelines ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 221}),\n"," Document(page_content='204 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nand the FDA stress that LABAs should not be used as \\nmonotherapy for the long-term control of persistent asthma. \\nLABAs should continue to be considered as an adjunctive \\ntherapy to ICS and their use in combination with ICS should \\nbe done with a single inhaler to ensure compliance with the \\naforementioned recommendation. Despite the FDA’s con -\\ncerns, there are extensive data supporting the use of LABAs \\nin patients with moderate to severe asthma in combination \\nwith an ICS.10,11,23,24\\nStudies in the mid-1990s showed that adding salmeterol \\nversus a higher dose of ICS in asthma patients with symp -\\ntoms on ICS resulted in less impairment.23,24 The formoterol \\nand corticosteroids establishing therapy (FACET) interna -\\ntional study group showed that the addition of formoterol \\nto budesonide in patients either on low- or moderate-dose \\nICS reduced severe exacerbations. Overall, these data sup -\\nport the use of LABA in patients uncontrolled on ICS alone \\nover the use of ICS in higher doses. This was further sup -\\nported by the gaining optimal asthma control (GOAL) study \\npublished in 2004.11 In patients who were not well controlled on moderate to high doses of ICS, the achievement of well-\\ncontrolled or completely controlled asthma was enhanced by \\nthe addition of a LABA.\\nWhat about patients who have uncontrolled asthma \\ndespite optimal therapy according to the guidelines?  \\nThere are many potential reasons for this, including comor -\\nbid conditions that could aggravate their symptoms.

This is because for -\\nmoterol has a rapid onset of action and produces bronchodi -\\nlation in less than 15 min. Several studies have demonstrated \\nthat patients have greater reductions in asthma exacerbations \\nand lower overall corticosteroid loads compared with a fixed-\\ndose ICS/LABA combination.26 The so-called SMART \\ntherapy (salmeterol maintenance and reliever therapy) is \\napproved by the European Union and Health Canada, but \\nnot in the United States. With the advent of Dulera on the \\nmarket, there are currently two options for consideration as \\nSMART therapy.\\nFinally, one can also consider the addition of tiotropium \\nbromide. Recent studies indicate that the addition of tiotro -\\npium bromide improved FEV1 and PEFs to a greater degree \\nthan LABA or doubling the dose of ICS.17 Similar to LABAs, \\ntiotropium improved asthma-control days over doubling the \\ndose of ICS. More recently, adding tiotropium to main -\\ntenance therapy with high-dose ICS with LABA has been \\nshown to improve the pulmonary function of patients with \\nsevere uncontrolled asthma.18\\nTherefore, in patients who are not controlled despite \\noptimal therapy, there are many options to consider. These \\noptions need to be carefully weighed based on an individual’s \\nneeds.\\nThere is also controversy as to when to step down from \\nasthma therapy. The guidelines recommend that the cur -\\nrent step in asthma therapy be maintained until control is \\nachieved for a minimum of 3 months. In patients who are \\non medium to high doses of ICS with a LABA, the question \\narises whether one should step off the LABA or step down \\nthe ICS. In 2010, the U.S. FDA recommended that the LABA \\nshould be stepped off. However, there are no data to support \\nthis approach. A systematic review published in the Archives \\nof Internal Medicine  in 201227 showed that a meta-analysis \\nof studies to date favored the continued use of LABA. Thus, \\nalthough there is controversy over the safety of LABAs, there \\nis a considerable amount of evidence supporting their use for \\npatients with asthma.\\nMISCELLANEOUS CONSIDERATIONS\\naspIrIn-exacerbated  respIratory  dIsease\\nAspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA])-induced asthma is \\nassociated with rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, and asthma \\n(ASA triad or Sampter’s triad), which is precipitated by \\naspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. \\nThis is more commonly seen in females and often presents \\nin patients around 30–40 years of age. Aspirin-sensitive \\npatients are noted to have increased eosinophilic inflamma -\\ntion, and these patients have been found to have increased \\nlevels of urinary LTE4. Atopy is not a risk factor for ASA triad. Aspirin and cross-reacting COX1 nonsteroidal anti-\\ninflammatory agents should be avoided in such patients \\nand, if this cannot be done, desensitization, preferably post -\\npolypectomy, is an option.28\\nasthMa In pregnancy  (see chapter  25)\\nAsthma has been shown to affect up to 8% of pregnant women \\nand is probably one of the most common medical causes of \\nmorbidity in pregnancy. Better control of asthma lowers the \\nrisk of pregnancy complications and mortality associated \\nwith asthma. Limited information is available on pharmaco -\\ntherapy in pregnancy. Most studies have shown that it is safer \\nto use medications to keep asthma under control, rather than \\nhave an acute exacerbation during pregnancy. It is essential \\nto identify and avoid any exacerbating factors, including \\nexposure to tobacco smoke and GERD.29\\noccupat Ional asthMa (see chapter  24)\\nExposure to high molecular weight proteins and low molec -\\nular weight chemicals followed by a latency period before \\nsymptom onset has been demonstrated to cause occupational \\nasthma in a previously healthy, susceptible worker or to exac -\\nerbate preexisting asthma. Furthermore, acute or chronic \\nexposure to irritants in the workplace can cause airway \\nhyperresponsiveness and bronchial constriction, referred to \\nas irritant-induced asthma or reactive airways dysfunction \\nsyndrome (RADS). The early identification of occupational \\nasthma is required to prevent further exposure and to obtain \\ngood long-term outcomes.30\\nexerc Ise-Induced  bronchoconstr IctIon (eIb) \\n(see chapter  12)\\nEIB is defined as a lower airway obstruction with symp -\\ntoms of cough, wheezing, or dyspnea induced by exercise \\nin patients without underlying asthma. Exercise-induced \\nasthma is the same as EIB except that it occurs in patients \\nwith chronic asthma. Exercising causes hyperventilation of \\nair that is dryer and cooler,31 and this loss of heat and mois -\\nture causes bronchoconstriction. The onset of EIB is usually \\nminutes after beginning exercise, peaks around 10 min after \\nstopping exercise, and lasts around 30–40 min. The diagno -\\nsis is based on a history of chest tightness, cough, and wheez -\\ning after exercising; also, exercise-challenge testing can be \\ndone. A 15% decrease in FEV1 postexercise is consistent \\nwith EIB.32 Treatment usually involves the use of a SABA \\n15–30 min prior to exercise.\\nREFERENCES\\n 1.

He initially focuses on his upper respiratory \\ncomplaints, but mentions shortness of breath in the review \\nof systems. Upon further questioning, the patient reports \\na history of childhood asthma and increased shortness of \\nbreath for several years, which he attributes to “old age.” He \\nsmoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years in the dis -\\ntant past. He has a history of diabetes and hypertension. On \\nexamination, he has faint expiratory wheezes. Pulmonary \\nfunction testing (PFT) reveals a forced expiratory volume \\nin 1 sec (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of 62% \\nand an FEV1 of 65%, with a 20% improvement in FEV1 with \\nalbuterol. His postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio is 71%. \\nHis initial Asthma Control Test (ACT) score is 13 (indicating \\nuncontrolled asthma).\\nThe patient receives extensive counseling regarding the \\ndiagnosis of probable asthma with a possible component \\nof chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is \\nstarted on mometasone two puffs at night, a dry powder ste -\\nroid inhaler with a dose counter, and he receives counseling \\non the appropriate inhaler technique. His allergy skin test -\\ning is positive for several indoor and outdoor aeroallergens, \\nfor which he receives counseling on avoidance measures.\\nAfter 1 month, the patient’s ACT has improved to 16 and \\nhis peak expiratory flow (PEF) is 70% of normal. However, \\nhe has developed thrush, which is treated with antifungal \\nlozenges. The mometasone is changed to a beclometasone hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) metered-dose inhaler (MDI), two \\npuffs twice daily with a spacer device to optimize his inhaler \\ntechnique. After extensive counseling, he demonstrates the \\nappropriate technique. After 2 months, his thrush has not \\nrecurred, but his asthma symptoms are still uncontrolled, \\nwith a FEV1 of 74%. His beclometasone is increased to four \\npuffs twice daily (high dose) and he again develops recur -\\nrent thrush. He is subsequently changed to budesonide/\\nformoterol, a combination inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and \\nlong-acting beta-agonist (LABA), two puffs twice daily. \\nAfter a few days, he is hospitalized for severe shortness of \\nbreath and is noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid \\nventricular rate. He is taken off budesonide/formoterol, \\nplaced on a beta-blocker for control of the atrial fibrilla -\\ntion, and instructed to restart beclomethasone two puffs \\ntwice daily. He does not restart beclomethasone because of \\na concern for side effects. One month later, his PEF rate is \\n40% of normal and he is visibly short of breath. He receives \\na 5-day course of prednisone and is restarted on beclo -\\nmethasone. His symptoms improve quickly but his asthma \\nremains uncontrolled. He is started on tiotropium (in com -\\nbination with beclomethasone). Six weeks later, his ACT has \\nimproved to 20 (controlled) and his FEV1 is stable at 82%.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThe number of asthmatics aged 65 and older in the United \\nStates is expected to double  to greater than 6 million in the 20Management of Asthma in Older Adults\\nTolly G.

Aging is associated with physiological, anatomi -\\ncal, and psychosocial changes, all of which may impact treat -\\nment responses. Older asthmatics may also require greater \\nassistance and possibly alternative strategies to achieve \\ngood inhaler technique and compliance with care regimens. \\nMoreover, the existence of significant medical comorbidities \\nin this population can lead to diagnostic delays and may limit \\nmanagement options. This chapter presents an evidence-\\nbased approach to tackling these issues in order to provide \\noptimal care for older asthmatics.\\nDIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA IN OLDER ADULTS\\nDespite the high morbidity and mortality from asthma in \\nolder adults, underrecognition of asthma in this age group \\nremains a significant problem. Some studies have suggested \\nthat the diagnosis is missed in approximately 50% of asth -\\nmatics aged 65 and older.8 This is in part because of the large \\ndifferential diagnosis of diseases that can present with respi -\\nratory difficulties in this age group.9 There is also a com -\\nmon misperception that asthma only begins in childhood \\nor young to middle adulthood. In reality, the incidence of \\nasthma remains approximately 1 in 1000 throughout adult \\nlife, with 40%–50% of asthmatics developing symptoms \\nafter age 40, and more than 10% reporting symptom-onset \\nafter age 65.10,11 Another major reason for a delay in diagnosis \\nis that older asthmatics, particularly those with a long-stand -\\ning disease, are frequently “poor perceivers” of acute and \\nchronic lung impairment.12 Having a less active lifestyle may \\nalso contribute to underrecognition of symptoms. Moreover, \\ncognitive impairment and depression, which occur more fre -\\nquently with age, may prohibit the recognition of the disease \\nby both the patient and his or her physician.7 Despite the criti -\\ncal need for objective testing in such situations, PFTs are less \\nfrequently performed in older asthmatics.13\\nSome conditions that may confound the diagnosis of \\nor occur concurrently with asthma in older adults include \\nCOPD, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, pulmonary \\nemboli, chronic aspiration, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), bronchiectasis, tracheobronchial tumors, and \\npostnasal drainage from chronic rhinitis. It can be particu -\\nlarly challenging to differentiate asthma from COPD in older \\nadults. Both conditions can present with shortness of breath, \\nchest tightness, wheezing, or cough. It is, nevertheless, impor -\\ntant to establish the correct diagnosis, given that the prognosis \\nand the ideal therapeutic regimens for these conditions may \\ndiffer. For example, first-line therapy for patients with mod -\\nerate COPD consists of a long-acting bronchodilator alone, \\nwhich would be inappropriate and potentially dangerous for \\nan individual with asthma.14 Table 20.1 provides some helpful \\ntips to distinguish COPD from asthma in older adults.\\nThe Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung \\nDisease (GOLD) defines COPD as a common preventable \\nand treatable disease, characterized by persistent airflow \\nlimitation that is usually progressive and associated with an \\nenhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and \\nthe lungs to noxious particles or gases.14,15 The hallmark fea -\\ntures of COPD include that it generally begins later in life, it \\nis largely related to tobacco smoke exposure, and it is char -\\nacterized by irreversible airflow obstruction (though there is \\noften an element of reversibility present in COPD).9,15 Based \\non the GOLD criteria, a cutoff of 70% for the FEV1/FVC \\nratio defines the presence of an airflow obstruction. While \\nit is less challenging to differentiate COPD from asthma in \\nyounger populations, older adults with tobacco exposure fre -\\nquently have elements of both diseases.16 It is not uncommon \\nto encounter older asthmatics with substantial tobacco expo -\\nsure, as the prevalence of previous tobacco use in older adults \\nmay be as high as 50%.11 In addition, a previous smoking \\nhistory does not necessarily indicate that an individual has \\nCOPD, as only a small minority of individuals who smoke go \\non to develop the disease.17 Therefore, an older age of symp -\\ntom onset does not exclude asthma. Furthermore, as lung \\nfunction may become irreversible in chronic asthma, this \\ncondition needs to be differentiated from COPD.\\nPFTs to differentiate COPD from asthma can sometimes \\nbe misleading in older adults. Healthy aging is associated \\nwith a decline in FEV1, and using a fixed cutoff value of 70% \\nfor the FEV1/FVC ratio, rather than the lower limit of nor -\\nmal (LLN) to identify COPD, may result in misclassifica -\\ntion. Thus, the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European \\nRespiratory Society (ERS) currently recommends that the \\nLLN for the FEV1/FVC ratio be adjusted for age.18 Classically, \\na diagnosis of asthma is established by the combination of: \\n(1) symptoms consistent with asthma; (2) spirometry show -\\ning obstruction with at least 12% and 200 mL reversibility \\nin the FEV1 or FVC with a bronchodilator (albuterol); or (3) \\na positive methacholine challenge test for airway hyperre -\\nsponsiveness. These diagnostic criteria do not always serve \\nto rule out COPD, however, as more than 50% of individu -\\nals with COPD may have significant reversibility.15 Some \\nindividuals with COPD also have a positive methacholine \\nchallenge test.19 Moreover, a low postbronchodilator FEV1/\\nFVC ratio does not reliably rule out asthma in older adults, \\nas at least 16% of asthmatics may develop a fixed obstructive \\ndefect over time due to airway remodeling.20 While a low ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 226}),\n"," Document(page_content='209 Management of Asthma in Older Adults\\ndiffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) can help \\npoint toward a diagnosis of COPD, patients with asthma and \\ntobacco exposure may have a low DLCO but maintain many \\nof the clinical characteristics of asthma.\\nThe reluctance of some physicians to order PFTs in older \\nasthmatics may be partly due to the increased difficulty of \\nperforming adequate spirometry in older adults.13 Obtaining \\na good-quality PFT from an older adult may require an \\nadditional 20–30 min and a greater number of FVC maneu -\\nvers in order to achieve consistent results.9 Nevertheless, at \\nleast 50%–90% of older adults are able to meet quality end \\npoints, and there are very few circumstances in which spi -\\nrometry should not be attempted in order to establish the cor -\\nrect diagnosis.9 Because they include increased numbers of \\nolder adults, the National Health and Nutrition Examination \\n(NHANES) III reference equations should be used for spi -\\nrometry in this age group.21\\nAs mentioned previously, the interpretation of PFTs \\nshould take into account that it may be more difficult to dem -\\nonstrate airway reversibility in older asthmatics. This may be \\ndue to airway remodeling or a blunted response to inhaled \\nbeta-agonists that can occur with age (see ‘Inhaled Beta2-\\nAgonists’). Older age is not a contraindication to performing \\nmethacholine challenge testing for patients in whom the diag -\\nnosis of asthma cannot be established with spirometry alone. \\nMethacholine testing has safely been performed in patients \\nup to 92 years old with a baseline FEV1 of >70%.11 PEF mon -\\nitoring can also be attempted in order to demonstrate 20% \\ndiurnal variability to establish a diagnosis of asthma in older \\npatients; however, peak flow measurements are less reliable \\nin patients with cognitive or physical impairments. Little is \\nknown regarding the utility of exhaled nitric oxide (ENO) measurements to assist with the diagnosis of asthma in older \\nadults. One study of 77 adults over 60 years of age found that \\nENO was not helpful to distinguish asthmatics from control \\nsubjects, although the findings may have been influenced by \\nthe use of ICS.7\\nTREATMENT OF ASTHMA IN OLDER ADULTS\\nEvidence-based guidelines should be used in the same way \\nfor the treatment of asthma in older adults as they are in \\nyounger individuals.22 Older adults who are diagnosed with \\npersistent asthma should be placed on a controller therapy \\naccording to their level of severity, and their medications \\nshould be adjusted at follow-up based on both domains of \\nasthma control (i.e., impairment and risk). While the basic \\nprinciples of “step-therapy” are the same regardless of age, \\noptimal therapeutic strategies in older asthmatics may vary \\ndue to psychosocial factors and because of age-related differ -\\nences in medication efficacy and side effects. Clinical trials \\nfor asthma frequently exclude older asthmatics, thus mak -\\ning it more difficult to develop evidence-based assessments \\nof various pharmaceutical agents for this age group. Despite \\nthese challenges, some studies have found that older asthmat -\\nics who are appropriately managed can achieve comparable \\nif not better asthma control than younger individuals.23\\noverco MIng barrIers to adherence  \\nto MedIcal advIce In older asthMatIcs\\nThe Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) framework empha -\\nsizes that the creation of a partnership between the clini -\\ncian and the patient with asthma is critical to achieve and TABLE 20.1\\nHelpful Tools to Differentiate Asthma from COPD in Older Adults\\nCOPD Asthma\\nSymptoms Shortness of breath with exertion may be \\nprominent and develops slowly over timeIntermittent flare-ups more common\\nFamily history Generally absent May be present, especially if childhood \\nonset\\nExposure history Tobacco exposure prominent Tobacco does not rule out\\nAge of onset Generally after age 40–50 years unless \\nstrong susceptibilityAny age; breathing problems in childhood \\nincrease suspicion\\nCommon comorbid conditions Osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, \\ndepression, weight lossAtopy (although many nonatopic); \\naspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease \\n(AERD) with nasal polyposis\\nClassic pulmonary function test \\nfindingsPostbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio <0.7 \\n(GOLD criteria)\\nor\\nPostbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio less \\nthan the lower limit of normal for age, \\ngender, height, and race (ATS/ERS \\ncriteria)\\nand/or\\nLow diffusing capacity for carbon \\nmonoxide (DLCO)FEV1/FVC ratio consistent with \\nobstruction\\nand\\nIncrease in FEV1 of 12% and 200 mL with \\nbronchodilator\\nor\\n Positive methacholine challenge test', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 227}),\n"," Document(page_content='210 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nmaintain good asthma control.24 This partnership requires \\nactive participation by the patient in his or her care, which \\nincludes ongoing communication with the physician as well \\nas daily compliance with medications. Patients must also \\nlearn to develop appropriate inhaler techniques and to moni -\\ntor for signs of asthma exacerbations. As a starting point, \\npatients and physicians must identify and agree on the goals \\nof treatment. While improving asthma symptoms is generally \\nrecognized as an important treatment goal by both patients \\nand physicians, many older patients do not appreciate the \\nimportance of developing self-management skills, improving \\nairflow obstruction based on objective testing, and maintain -\\ning normal body weight.25 Patients with significant cognitive, \\nemotional, physical, or financial difficulties frequently find it \\ndifficult to maintain an active partnership with their physi -\\ncians. Moreover, complicated treatment regimens that do not \\ntake these issues into account may become burdensome and \\noverwhelming, leading to frustration and poor adherence. \\nFor most older patients, maintaining an acceptable quality of \\nlife requires that prescribed treatments must incur minimal \\nside effects and financial burden. Physicians must recognize \\nand accommodate these factors.\\nOlder asthmatics may find it difficult to identify worsen -\\ning asthma control because of a poor perception of dyspnea \\nand confusion with symptoms related to comorbid diseases. \\nMany older adults assume that shortness of breath is a rou -\\ntine part of aging, and do not report symptoms unless they \\nare severe. Routinely performing objective measurements, \\nincluding peak flow monitoring and spirometry are therefore \\nparticularly important in this age group.12 Routine moni -\\ntoring of asthma symptoms and rescue medication using \\nstandardized questionnaires such as the ACT are also recom -\\nmended; however, these tests may be less reliable in patients \\nwith multiple comorbid conditions who sometimes cannot \\ndifferentiate asthma symptoms from those related to other \\nconditions.21\\nAnother major issue impacting adherence is that many \\nolder asthmatics do not properly use commonly prescribed \\ninhaler devices due to physical or cognitive limitations.26 \\nUsing the correct inhaler technique, including shaking the \\ndevice before use, administering a dose, and holding one’s \\nbreath after the dose is administered, is critically important \\nto ensure the proper delivery of medication to the lungs. \\nMDIs in particular require some dexterity to coordinate the \\nactuation of the device by pressing down on the canister, \\nwith inhalation followed by breath holding. One out of two \\npatients is unable to demonstrate the proper MDI technique.26 \\nAs few as 10% of adults aged 65 and older may be able to \\noptimally use a MDI due to physical impairments such as \\nhand arthritis, muscle weakness, visual problems, or cogni -\\ntive difficulties that can limit one’s ability to learn and retain \\ninformation.26 Cognitive impairment is a strong predictor of \\npoor inhaler technique, with a score of 23/30 or lower on the \\nMini Mental Test identifying patients who are at risk of poor \\ntechnique.26\\nThere are several administration strategies that can reduce \\ndosing administration errors in older asthmatics. First and foremost, adequate time and attention must be devoted to edu -\\ncation and routine reevaluation of inhaler technique. Spacer \\ndevices for MDIs improve drug delivery in older patients \\nwho have difficulties with MDIs.27 These devices, which can \\nhold the administered dose in the chamber for more than \\none inspiration, eliminate the necessity of simultaneously \\ncoordinating dose actuation and deep inhalation.26 While \\nmost studies have not shown improved medication delivery \\nwith nebulizer devices versus MDIs with spacers, using a \\nnebulizer is a reasonable approach for patients who cannot \\nachieve a good inhaler technique due to fatigue, frailty, or \\nvarious other reasons. The use of breath-actuated inhal -\\ners, which are automatically triggered by inhalation, offers \\nanother alternative. Some studies have shown that breath-\\nactuated inhalers are easier and more successfully used by \\nolder patients; however, others found more errors in the use \\nof these devices compared to MDIs.28 Dry powder inhalers, \\nsuch as Turbuhalers and Diskus inhalers (Accuhalers), which \\nalso do not require simultaneous dose actuation and deep \\ninhalation, have been associated with fewer administration \\nerrors in older adults.29 The downside to these devices is that \\nthey require adequate peak inspiratory flow rates (60–90 L/\\nmin for Turbuhaler and 30–90 L/min for Diskus) to ensure \\ndeaggregation (in the case of the Turbuhaler) and drug deliv -\\nery to the lungs.29 Some older asthmatics are therefore not \\nable to achieve adequate drug delivery using a dry powder \\ninhaler due to the decline in the peak inspiratory flow that \\noccurs with age.29 Another consideration when selecting an \\ninhaler device is whether or not the device has a dose counter. \\nHaving a dose counter is particularly useful for patients on \\nmultiple medications or those with cognitive difficulties who \\nmay have problems keeping track of when an MDI needs to \\nbe refilled. In addition, as for any age group, the ease of use \\nof various delivery devices must be balanced against the like -\\nlihood of achieving asthma control based on other properties \\nof the prescribed medication.\\nInhaled  beta2-agon Ists\\nRegardless of age, short-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists \\n(SABAs) such as albuterol are considered an essential, life-sav -\\ning component of asthma management by allowing for rapid \\nbronchodilation during acute asthma exacerbations. Long-\\nacting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABAs), including salme -\\nterol and formoterol, also play an important role together with \\nICS controller therapy for individuals who require Step three \\nor higher care.22 It is important to be aware of the potential for \\nage-related differences in responses to beta2-agonists.26 The \\nactivity of the sympathetic nervous system increases by about \\n10%–15% per decade of life. In addition, age-related changes \\nin beta2-receptor density, affinity, and signaling have been sug -\\ngested. Data regarding the relationship between the density of \\nbeta2-receptors and age are complex; however, the administra -\\ntion of corticosteroids to older individuals is known to induce \\nan increased response to beta2-agonists due to an increase in \\nthe density of beta2-receptors. In addition, the percentage of \\nhigh-affinity beta-receptors on target tissues declines with ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 228}),\n"," Document(page_content='211 Management of Asthma in Older Adults\\nage.30–32 Age-related abnormalities in cyclic adenosine mono -\\nphosphate (cAMP) levels and activity, which is important for \\nbeta-receptor signaling, have also been identified.33\\nWhile studies involving SABAs and LABAs have shown \\nefficacy and good tolerability among older asthmatics, \\nsome have suggested that they may be less effective than \\nthey are in younger individuals. One study found that older \\nasthmatics had a decreased FEV1 response to SABAs with \\nage.34 Another study showed a decreased ability of SABAs \\nto return the FEV1 to normal after methacholine testing in \\nhealthy individuals aged 60–76 years.35 In contrast, age did \\nnot affect the impact of SABAs on FEV1 improvement after \\nmethacholine challenge testing in a third study.36 In addition, \\nanother study found that age was not a predictor of response \\nto SABAs for acute severe asthma attacks.37 A recent study \\ncomparing the efficacy of budesonide/formoterol (a com -\\nbination inhaled steroid and a LABA) therapy in asthmat -\\nics over 65 years of age versus younger patients found that \\nboth groups showed similar improvements in asthma control \\nbased on asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) scores and \\nexacerbations.38 In addition, the age of asthma onset did not \\nimpact treatment responses among older asthmatics.\\nThe side effects related to beta2-agonists tend to be more pro -\\nnounced in older patients. Oral beta2-agonists should be avoided \\nin favor of inhaled medications. Inhaled beta2-agonists can \\ncause an increase in the heart rate, blood pressure, myocardial \\noxygen demand, hypokalemia, nausea, and tremor in patients of \\nany age. Older patients are more susceptible to adverse events \\nrelated to these effects due to preexisting comorbid conditions \\nsuch as ischemic heart disease and arrhythmias, as well as the \\nincreased potential for medication interactions due to poly -\\npharmacy. In a study of 7599 patients with symptomatic heart \\nfailure, the use of inhaled bronchodilators was associated with \\nincreased all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, heart fail -\\nure hospitalization, and major adverse cardiovascular events.39 \\nAnother study of 1244 heart failure patients found no increased \\nrisk of long-term mortality associated with beta2-agonist use.40 \\nFuture prospective studies may clarify the risks of beta2-agonist \\nuse in patients with cardiac disease. For now, a careful consider -\\nation of the potential risks and benefits of beta2-agonists in older \\npatients with cardiac conditions should be undertaken.\\nSeparate from the cardiac risks, some studies have also \\ndescribed an increased risk for asthma-related death with \\nLABAs. This led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to \\nrequire labeling in 2010 indicating that LABAs should only \\nbe used (1) in combination with an ICS for asthmatics, (2) in \\nindividuals who cannot achieve adequate control with other \\ncontroller medications, and (3) for the shortest duration of \\ntime required to achieve asthma control and then discontin -\\nued if possible. The risks for adverse effects with LABAs \\nmay be greatest in children, although the aforementioned \\nrecommendations apply to individuals of all age groups.\\nantIchol Inerg Ic agents\\nBoth short-acting and long-acting inhaled anticholinergic \\nantimuscarinic agents can be used in addition to ICS for the treatment of asthma. These agents lead to airway smooth \\nmuscle relaxation (bronchodilation) and decreased mucus \\nsecretion. Existing asthma guidelines provide little informa -\\ntion regarding the appropriate use of these drugs. In addition, \\nage-related changes in the efficacy and safety of anticholin -\\nergics are less well studied than those for beta2-agonists. It \\nis known that parasympathetic activity decreases with age, \\nand animal studies have shown changes in anticholinergic \\nresponses due to reduced receptor numbers or postreceptor \\ncoupling.41,42 The safety profile of anticholinergics in older \\nadults is generally favorable, with a dry mouth and occa -\\nsional prostate-related symptoms being the most commonly \\nreported side effects. While, in general, SABAs are thought \\nto be better bronchodilators than anticholinergics, one \\nstudy found that asthmatics over 60 years of age had a bet -\\nter response to the short-acting anticholinergic, ipratropium \\nbromide, than a SABA.43 Another study found that the short-\\nacting anticholinergic, oxitropium, led to improved asthma \\ncontrol in older asthmatics who were already taking high-\\ndose ICS.44\\nIn recent years, tiotropium, a long-acting antimuscarinic \\nagent (LAMA), has become increasingly utilized as a ther -\\napy for asthma. In 2010, a high-profile study of 210 asthmat -\\nics found that tiotropium led to an equivalent improvement in \\nsymptoms and lung function as a LABA when used as an add-\\non therapy with ICS.45 Another study involving 107 severe \\nasthmatics found that tiotropium improved lung function \\namong patients who were already taking high-dose inhaled \\nsteroids and a LABA.46 Studies regarding the use of LAMAs \\nin older asthmatics are lacking; however, they may turn out \\nto be an especially useful therapy in this population, given \\ntheir generally favorable side-effect profile and theoretical \\npotential for age-related superiority over LABAs. It should \\nbe noted, however, that several studies have raised concerns \\nregarding the safety of tiotropium in cardiac patients with \\nCOPD.47 Further study to clarify the efficacy and safety of \\nshort-acting and long-acting anticholinergics in older asth -\\nmatics is warranted.\\nleuKotrIene receptor  antagon Ists (ltra s)\\nLTRAs, such as montelukast, are considered an appropriate \\nadd-on therapy in combination with ICS for asthmatics of \\nall ages, and may be considered as a monotherapy in mild \\nasthmatics.22,24 The efficacy of antileukotrienes for older \\nasthmatics has not been extensively studied. A recent study \\nof 513 asthmatics over 60 years of age found that montelu -\\nkast decreased exacerbations and the need for rescue inhaler \\nuse among severe asthmatics who were taking ICS and a \\nLABA.48 In addition, a study of 41 asthmatics over 65 years \\nof age found that pranlukast was equivalent to an ICS as a \\nmonotherapy for mild asthma.49 LTRAs thus appear to be \\nuseful for some older asthmatics. In particular, a trial of these \\nmedications for older asthmatics with nasal polyposis and/or \\naspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is reason -\\nable, given that AERD patients have been shown to incur \\ngreater improvements in asthma control with LTRAs than ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 229}),\n"," Document(page_content='212 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\ncan be achieved with ICS alone. In addition, because they are \\nin pill form, LTRAs are easier to use for older patients who \\nhave difficulties with inhalers. While they are generally well \\ntolerated, a potential increased risk of Churg–Strauss vas -\\nculitis has been reported among patients taking leukotriene \\nantagonists. In addition, concerns have been raised regarding \\npsychological side effects, including a potentially increased \\nrisk of suicide.50 Physicians prescribing these medications in \\nolder asthmatics, who are at increased risk of depression and \\ncognitive impairment, must be aware of these risks.\\nMethylxanth Ines\\nTheophylline is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that has been \\nused as a bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory agent for \\nasthma for over 75 years. It has become less popular in \\nrecent years because of its narrow therapeutic window (10–\\n20 mg/L) and its potential for life-threatening arrhythmias. \\nSeveral important changes occur with aging that impact the -\\nophylline responses, including (1) decreased activity of phos -\\nphodiesterases, and (2) reduced clearance of the drug by the \\nliver and kidneys with a resultant increased half-life.51 The \\ndecline in theophylline clearance becomes especially promi -\\nnent beginning in the seventh decade of life. In addition, \\ntheophylline has the potential for multiple drug interactions, \\nwhich is problematic in older asthmatics on multiple medica -\\ntions. While theophylline can be effective for older asthmat -\\nics, it should be used cautiously in this population given the \\naforementioned concerns.\\nInhaled  cortIcostero Ids\\nWhile ICS are the cornerstone of asthma management for \\nasthmatics of any age, the side effects related to these medi -\\ncations can be more prominent in older adults.52 Oral can -\\ndidiasis associated with ICS may occur more frequently in \\nolder asthmatics, particularly among those with dentures. \\nThe measures to minimize candida infection, including the \\nuse of spacers and mouth-rinsing after ICS dosing, should \\nbe emphasized. The risk of osteoporosis related to oral and \\ninhaled steroids increases with age, and routine monitoring \\nfor its development should be conducted. Screening for cata -\\nracts among older asthmatics with previous oral or high-dose \\nICS should be considered. In addition, consideration should \\nalso be given to measuring vitamin D levels in this popu -\\nlation, both for bone health and because of the association \\nbetween low vitamin D levels, which are common in older \\nadults, and poorer asthma control.\\nother treat Ment cons Iderat Ions In older asthMatIcs\\nOther therapies that are effective for younger asthmatics can \\nalso be considered in older asthmatics. Subcutaneous aller -\\ngen immunotherapy may be appropriate for atopic asthmat -\\nics of any age, although the presence of comorbid conditions \\nand medications that impact the safety of immunotherapy \\n(e.g., beta-blockers) must be considered. The humanized monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody, omali -\\nzumab, has been shown to improve asthma symptoms and \\nlung function and to decrease exacerbations in atopic, severe \\nasthmatics with a median age of 60 years; seven patients stud -\\nied were over 64 years of age.53 Another study also showed \\nclinical improvements among severe, atopic asthmatics aged \\n50 and older.54 Omalizumab can thus also be considered in \\nolder, severe asthmatics with atopy who are refractory to \\nother therapies and meet the dosing criteria involving body \\nweight and total IgE level.\\nObesity in Older Adults\\nObesity may be a risk factor for more severe asthma in \\nolder adults. A study of 104 asthmatics aged 65 and older \\nfound that obesity was significantly associated with poorer \\nasthma control based on ACQ scores; this finding remained \\nafter adjusting for multiple other potential risk factors.11 It \\nis unclear if the association between obesity and asthma is \\nrelated to changes that occur in the lung mechanics with \\nincreased weight, versus the potential effects of obesity on the \\nimmune system. Studies in younger age groups have shown \\nthat weight loss improves asthma control and decreases air -\\nway hyperresponsiveness.55\\nExercise and Pulmonary Rehabilitation\\nExercise programs tailored for asthmatics have been shown \\nto improve both physical and psychosocial functioning in \\nyounger patients. Programs that encourage increased physi -\\ncal activity and especially those that increase respiratory \\nmuscle strength may lead to improved quality of life in older \\nasthmatics.56 Pulmonary rehabilitation is a standard of care \\nfor patients with COPD, and may be considered in appropri -\\nate older asthmatics.21 Some of the key aspects of the treat -\\nment of asthma in older adults are summarized in Table 20.2.\\nCONTROLLING TRIGGERS FOR \\nASTHMA IN OLDER ASTHMATICS\\nEnvironmental control measures are recognized as an impor -\\ntant component of care in asthma treatment guidelines.24 \\nBecause of the increased time that they spend at home rela -\\ntive to younger adults, older adults may have greater expo -\\nsure to residential air pollutants and indoor aeroallergens. \\nControlling home environmental exposures, if possible, is \\ntherefore especially important in this population.\\nRelevant air pollution exposures may include those from \\noutdoor sources that penetrate most dwellings, as well as \\nindoor pollutants from tobacco smoke, cooking, and heat -\\ning.9,11 Asthmatics aged 65 and older may be dispropor -\\ntionately impacted by traffic-related air pollution relative to \\nyounger asthmatics. A recent study showed that chronic resi -\\ndential exposure to traffic pollution was among the strongest \\npredictors of poorer asthma control in older adults.11 Multiple \\nother studies support the strong relationship between traffic \\npollution exposure and poor asthma control in older adults, \\nincluding: a systematic review of admissions for respiratory \\ndiseases and particulate air pollution indicating that children ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 230}),\n"," Document(page_content='213 Management of Asthma in Older Adults\\nand older adults were at greatest risk57; an ecological study \\nshowing that asthmatics aged 65 and older have a shorter “lag \\ntime” to hospitalization when exposed to outdoor air pollut -\\nants58; and a study indicating that higher traffic density and \\nozone levels have a greater impact on older asthmatics rela -\\ntive to younger asthmatics.59 Currently, there is unfortunately \\nlittle that can be recommended to limit exposure to outdoor \\nair pollutants that penetrate the home environment. It is rec -\\nommended that older asthmatics minimize the time that they \\nspend outdoors and keep windows closed on days that the air \\nquality index (AQI) is greater than 100.60\\nLittle is known about the impact of pollutants from indoor \\nsources on asthma in older adults. Wood-burning stoves and \\nbiomass contribute to COPD, and probably to asthma in rural \\nareas and developing countries. In addition, higher levels \\nof respirable particles, such as those from tobacco smoke, \\nare associated with increased acute respiratory symptoms \\nand lower PEFs among adults aged 65 years and older.61 \\nDecreasing their exposure to pollutants from indoor sources \\nshould be attempted in older asthmatics.\\nAeroallergen exposures can impact asthma control in sensi -\\ntized older asthmatics, although possibly to a lesser extent than \\nin younger individuals. While the prevalence of allergy-related \\nsymptoms may be lower in older versus younger asthmatics, \\ntwo recent studies found that at least 70% of older asthmatics \\nwere atopic based on having at least one positive allergy skin \\nprick test.7,11 No studies have specifically addressed the impact \\nof environmental control measures designed to decrease aero -\\nallergen exposures, such as those from pets, dust mites, or \\nmold, in older asthmatics. Despite a lack of evidence in this \\nage group, it may be reasonable to attempt environmental control measures for older, allergen-sensitive asthmatics based \\non their demonstrated efficacy in younger asthmatics.62\\nRespiratory virus infections are an important, potentially \\nmodifiable environmental risk factor for asthma exacerba -\\ntions in older asthmatics. The rate of infection with viral \\npathogens may be as high as 11% among older adults living \\nin institutional settings.21 In contrast, seniors living at home \\nappear to have lower infection rates than the general adult \\npopulation. While most data related to viral infections and \\nasthma exacerbations are extrapolated from younger popula -\\ntions, it is reasonable to assume that older asthmatics who \\nare exposed to these pathogens are at increased risk for exac -\\nerbations.21 As with asthmatics of any age, older asthmatics \\nshould be encouraged to undergo vaccination for influenza. \\nMeasures should also be taken in institutional and hospital \\nsettings to minimize the spread of viral infections, including \\nthe isolation of infected patients, hand washing, and wearing \\nmasks when appropriate.\\nASTHMA PHENOTYPES IN OLDER ADULTS\\nQuestions involving asthma phenotypes in older adults fre -\\nquently focus on the clinical significance of the age of asthma \\nonset as it relates to prognosis and treatment.

She has a long-standing history of asthma; her usual \\nmedications include a combination inhaler with fluticasone and \\nsalmeterol as well as montelukast, both of which her parents \\nadmit she takes irregularly. She has had three hospital admis -\\nsions for asthma in the past year (one of them in the pediatric \\nintensive care unit [PICU]); the most recent being 4 months ago. \\nHer last visit to the doctor was approximately 1 month ago; her \\nmother says her lung functions at that time were “low,” and the \\ndoctor insisted she needed to take her medicines daily and follow \\nup in a month. Her parents report she had been doing quite well \\nwith only nighttime cough until the night before, when she visited \\na friend who has several cats, to which she is allergic. On return -\\ning home, she started coughing, and they gave her albuterol neb -\\nulizations every 2–3 h all day with no apparent response. In the \\npast hour, they noticed that she was looking tired and lethargic, \\nand decided to bring her to the ER.On initial evaluation, she exhibited increased work of \\nbreathing with tachycardia, tachypnea, and O2 saturation of \\n88% despite being on oxygen at 10 Lpm via a nonrebreather \\nmask. She was conscious but lethargic. Breath sounds were \\ndecreased bilaterally with no wheezing. Back-to-back neb -\\nulizations with albuterol and ipratropium bromide were \\nadministered. Auscultation revealed sporadic inspiratory \\nand expiratory wheezes but still markedly decreased breath \\nsounds and prolonged expiration; she remained tachypneic \\nand was becoming less responsive. Continuous albuterol \\nnebulizations were administered and intravenous (IV) access \\nwas obtained after which she received a dose of methylpred -\\nnisolone and a normal saline bolus. Chest x-ray showed \\nmarked hyperinflation with some areas of atelectasis; arte -\\nrial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.34 and partial pres -\\nsure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 44 torr.

Heliox was \\nstarted and the patient was transferred to the PICU.\\nIn the PICU, she was placed on mechanical ventilation \\nand received continuous albuterol nebulization as well as IV \\nterbutaline and methylprednisolone. Within 24 h, ausculta -\\ntory findings improved with increased air entry; ABG nor -\\nmalized. She was extubated to positive pressure ventilation \\nby the second day and eventually weaned to room air. She \\nwas switched to oral corticosteroids by the third day and tol -\\nerated weaning of nebulized albuterol to every 4 h. She was \\ndischarged home after 5 days with instructions to continue \\nusual home medications and to follow up with her primary \\npediatrician and with the pulmonologist who saw her during \\nthe admission.\\nDEFINITION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\\nAsthma affects over 7 million children in the United States, \\nand status asthmaticus is the most common pediatric medi -\\ncal emergency in the country.1 The exact prevalence of \\n“near-fatal” asthma and of status asthmaticus is difficult to \\nestimate, because definitions of both vary significantly, but \\nmortality from the disease currently stands at approximately \\n28 deaths per year for every 1 million children with asthma, \\nand can be as high as 34 per million depending on age and \\ngender.2 This translates into at least ~200–240 unneces -\\nsary deaths due to childhood asthma every year. In previous \\nreview articles, status asthmaticus was defined as the con -\\ndition of a patient in progressive respiratory failure due to \\nasthma in whom conventional forms of therapy have failed; \\nfor clinical purposes, a patient not responding to initial doses \\nof nebulized bronchodilators is considered to have status \\nasthmaticus.3,4 A recent study of fatal and near-fatal asthma \\n(defined as asthma requiring mechanical ventilation) reported \\nthat in 13% of such cases there was no previous diagnosis of \\nasthma;1 in those children the initial presentation of asthma \\nwas a life-threatening exacerbation, which underscores the \\nimportance of prompt recognition and aggressive treatment \\nof such exacerbations.\\nPRESENTATION\\nClinical characteristics (Table 21.1) of a severe asthma exac -\\nerbation include dyspnea at rest, severely increased work \\nof breathing or respiratory distress, markedly decreased \\nbreath sounds, especially when wheezing is faint or inau -\\ndible (quiet lungs may mean there is simply no air move -\\nment and be a sign of impending respiratory failure), altered \\nmental status, rising pCO2 (pCO2 levels are usually low ini -\\ntially due to tachypnea, but may tend to “normalize” as the \\npatient becomes tired; this, too, may be a sign of impend -\\ning respiratory failure), and, when feasible to perform, peak \\nexpiratory flows (PEF) under 40% of predicted or personal \\nbest. The Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3) from the National \\nInstitutes of Health (NIH) of the United States further \\ndescribes life-threatening exacerbations as those in which \\npatients are too dyspneic to speak and PEF falls under 25% of predicted or personal best.5 However, the clinical pre -\\nsentation of severe or life-threatening status asthmaticus \\nis variable, and it is paramount that the clinician be able \\nto recognize severe cases rapidly and promptly escalate \\nmanagement to prevent potentially fatal complications. In \\nthe case described above, the patient presented with sev -\\neral of these characteristics, including significant dyspnea, \\nhypoxia, progressively altered mental status, “silent” lungs \\non auscultation, and worsening respiratory acidosis. As is \\nusually the case with these children, she failed to respond to \\nappropriate initial therapy with bronchodilators, but prompt \\nrecognition of the severity of the exacerbation and aggres -\\nsive treatment made it possible for her to recover without \\nmajor complications.\\nRISK FACTORS\\nThe EPR-3 lists several risk factors for death from asthma in \\nchildren and adults (Table 21.2).5 As evidenced by the table, \\nperhaps the most important single risk factor for a severe \\n(and potentially life-threatening) asthma exacerbation is a \\nprevious history of severe exacerbations, particularly when \\nsuch exacerbations have occurred recently. Additionally, \\nseveral studies have identified various risk factors such as \\ngender (male predominance in childhood with a later switch \\nto female predominance), low lung function despite treat -\\nment, longer duration of disease,6,7 exacerbation triggered by \\nallergens or irritants rather than exertion or viral illness, and \\nmore abrupt onset of the exacerbation.8 In a study of PICU \\nadmissions for asthma, Carroll et al. found that children with \\nmultiple PICU admissions for asthma are more likely to be \\noverweight and have public insurance and less likely to be \\nCaucasian compared with other asthmatic children with only \\none PICU admission.9 In the report by Newth et al. looking \\nat children who required intubation for a life-threatening \\nasthma exacerbation, there was an overrepresentation of \\nAfrican Americans.1 In that study, mortality rate was 4%, TABLE 21.1\\nClinical Characteristics of a Severe or \\nLife-Threatening Asthma Exacerbation\\nHistory\\nSleepiness or lethargy\\nDyspnea interferes with ability to talk\\nPhysical Examination\\nAltered mental status\\nSignificant respiratory distress\\n“Silent thorax” with markedly decreased air movement and scarce \\nwheezing\\nLaboratory\\nSignificant and/or refractory hypoxia\\n“Normalization” of pCO2 in the setting of persistent respiratory \\ndistress\\nRespiratory acidosis\\nPEF less than 40% of predicted or personal best', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 236}),\n"," Document(page_content='219 Severe Acute and Life-Threatening Asthma in Children\\nand 10 of the 11 children who died had experienced cardiac \\narrest before admission to the PICU.\\nGiven the known heritability of asthma, it is to be expected \\nthat genetic and genomic polymorphisms and variants will \\nlikely be associated with higher risk of severe or near-fatal \\nasthma. Polymorphisms of the beta-adrenergic receptor gene \\nADRB2 , for example, have been associated with the length \\nof PICU stay for status asthmaticus in children.10 Similarly, a \\nhigher level of African ancestry—determined using genetic \\nmethods—was recently associated with lower lung function \\nin Puerto Rican children,11 one of the ethnic groups with \\nthe highest prevalence, morbidity, and mortality related to \\nasthma. As the field progresses, new genetic or epigenetic \\nvariants may be identified that could be used to personal -\\nize management, both acute and chronic, according to the \\npatient’s asthma severity or risk for complications.\\nAsthma is a complex, multifactorial disease, and the risk \\nfactors for severe and life-threatening asthma exacerbations \\nare similarly complex. In summary, a past (and especially \\nrecent) history of a severe asthma exacerbation and poor \\nasthma control are probably the two most portentous risk fac -\\ntors for future severe exacerbations. Still, a significant pro -\\nportion of children who present with potentially fatal asthma \\nhave no recent history of similar attacks, and in many of \\nthem it may present their index presentation. Physicians and \\nproviders need to be aware of risk factors for severe asthma, \\nbut also should be able to recognize presenting signs and \\nsymptoms quickly even in children without prior history. \\nMost importantly, once recognized, they need to be able to act swiftly and aggressively manage the patient to prevent \\ncomplications or death.\\nMANAGEMENT\\ngeneral  Measures\\nAcute severe asthma in children is a common cause of admis -\\nsion to the PICU. Children with acute severe asthma require \\ncardiorespiratory monitoring and stabilization that ensure \\nthat the treatment goals of adequate oxygenation and rever -\\nsal of bronchial narrowing are achieved. Patients present \\nwith hypoxemia from ventilation–perfusion mismatch and \\nbenefit from high-flow supplemental oxygen delivered via a \\npartial or nonrebreather mask. Signs of impending respira -\\ntory failure should be monitored and prompt management \\nwith ventilatory support should be provided once present. \\nFluid replacement should be provided to restore euvolemia \\nfor dehydrated patients as a result of vomiting, poor intake, \\nand increased insensible fluid loss from the respiratory tract. \\nFluid balance should be monitored closely inasmuch as over -\\nhydration can result in pulmonary edema; patients can also \\ndevelop the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone \\nsecretion (SIADH).3,4\\nInItIal laboratory  studIes\\nThe objective of laboratory studies is to detect actual or \\nimpending respiratory failure. However, the decision to \\nintubate a patient and provide ventilatory support should \\nnot depend on laboratory measurements. ABG is useful for \\nassessment of pulmonary gas exchange. With increasing air -\\nflow obstruction, hypercarbia develops and heralds impend -\\ning respiratory failure. Venous levels of pCO2 have been \\ntested as a substitute for arterial measurements such that a \\nvenous pCO2 > 45 mmHg may serve as a screening test but \\ncannot substitute for ABG in the evaluation of respiratory \\nfunction.12 An indwelling arterial line facilitates frequent \\nblood gas assessment in the intubated and mechanically ven -\\ntilated patient.\\nComplete blood count (CBC) is not routinely required but \\nmay be considered in patients suspected to have concomitant \\ninfection, especially if they exhibit a fever or purulent spu -\\ntum. However, leukocytosis can be present in patients with \\nasthma exacerbations and can be further confounded by the \\nuse of systemic corticosteroids within a few hours of admin -\\nistration. Measurement of serum electrolytes is reasonable, \\nespecially for patients with cardiovascular disease and/or \\nreceiving diuretics inasmuch as frequent beta-agonist admin -\\nistration is associated with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, \\nand hypophosphatemia.\\nchest radIography\\nChest radiographs are not routinely required but may be \\nindicated when there is suspicion of another pulmonary \\nprocess such as air leak or barotrauma (pneumothorax or TABLE 21.2\\nRisk Factors for Death from Asthma (Children \\nand Adults)\\nAsthma History\\nPrevious severe exacerbation (e.g., intubation or PICU admission for \\nasthma)\\nTwo or more hospitalizations for asthma in the past year\\nThree or more ER visits for asthma in the past year\\nHospitalization or ER visit for asthma in the past month\\nUsing more than two canisters of albuterol per month\\nDifficulty perceiving asthma symptoms or severity of exacerbations\\nOther risk factors: lack of a written asthma action plan, sensitivity to \\nAlternaria , etc.\\nSocial History\\nLow socioeconomic status or inner-city residence\\nIllicit drug use\\nMajor psychosocial problems\\nComorbidities\\nCardiovascular disease\\nOther chronic lung disease\\nChronic psychiatric disease\\nOther chronic illnesses\\nSource:  National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) , \\nJ.

In this section, medications used in the PICU setting \\nare discussed; references to initial emergency department \\n(ED) management are mentioned whenever applicable. The \\ndosages of medications as described in the National Heart, \\nLung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidelines and cited ref -\\nerences are found in Table 21.3.\\nBeta-Receptor Agonists\\nBeta-receptor agonists are the mainstays of treatment of \\nacute severe asthma. By binding to beta-receptors in the \\nairway smooth muscles, short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) \\nproduce smooth muscle relaxation. To avoid the risk of car -\\ndiotoxicity, selective SABAs are recommended such as alb -\\nuterol; levalbuterol, the pure R enantiomer of albuterol, has \\nalso been used. These agents have rapid onsets of action and \\nhave been administered via several routes that include IV, \\nnebulized, subcutaneous, and oral. In the PICU setting, the \\nnebulized and IV routes are applicable. Of note is that the \\nuse of metered-dose inhalers with a valved holding chamber \\nfor delivery of albuterol has been found to be effective in children with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations.13–15 \\nHowever, the nebulized route may be the preferred route in \\nthe PICU for patients unable to cooperate due to factors such \\nas age and severity of presentation; the patient also derives \\nbenefit from the oxygen that is used to propel the nebuliza -\\ntion device. For patients who require frequent doses of alb -\\nuterol, continuous nebulization is preferred over intermittent \\ndoses. Continuous nebulization results in rapid improvement \\nwithout the increased risk of toxicity.16–19\\nLevalbuterol is more potent in beta-receptor binding \\nthan S-albuterol and is responsible for the bronchodilating \\neffects of the racemic compound—albuterol being an equal \\nmixture of R-albuterol and S-albuterol. However, Gawchik \\net al. found no significant differences in efficacy or safety \\nbetween levalbuterol and albuterol.20 In a prospective study \\nby Andrews et al., substituting high-dose continuous lev -\\nalbuterol for racemic albuterol did not reduce the time on \\ncontinuous therapy and had similar adverse effects in chil -\\ndren presenting in status asthmaticus who have failed initial \\ntreatment with racemic albuterol.21 No recommendation can \\npresently be made regarding the use of the more expensive \\nlevalbuterol in children with acute severe asthma.\\nIV beta-agonists should be considered in patients unre -\\nsponsive to treatment with continuous nebulization. Near-\\ncomplete airway obstruction as well as decreased tidal \\nvolumes may affect delivery of aerosolized bronchodilator to \\nthe lung. Terbutaline is the IV beta-agonist that is currently \\nused in the United States. In a prospective study conducted \\nby Bogie et al. the addition of IV terbutaline to continuous \\nhigh-dose nebulized albuterol in children with acute severe \\nasthma resulted in a trend toward improvement regarding \\noutcome measures consisting of asthma severity score, dura -\\ntion of continuous nebulized albuterol, and PICU stay.22\\nAdverse events related to beta-agonist use, via both inha -\\nlational and IV routes, are cardiac in nature. However, other \\nthan tachycardia or diastolic hypotension, neither albuterol \\nnor terbutaline is associated with clinically significant car -\\ndiac toxicity in pediatric patients.19,23 In a prospective study, \\nChiang et al. found no significant cardiac toxicity among \\npediatric patients with acute severe asthma who received \\nIV terbutaline.24 Other adverse events include tremors, \\nworsening of ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and transient \\ndecreases in serum levels of potassium, magnesium, and \\nphosphorus. On a cautionary note, severe hypokalemia may \\nprecipitate cardiac arrhythmias.\\nAnticholinergics\\nIncreased acetylcholine release from parasympathetic \\nnerves has been associated with increased smooth muscle \\ntone and bronchoconstriction. Ipratropium bromide, a qua -\\nternary ammonium derivative of atropine, is a short-acting \\nanticholinergic and has been used in the management of \\nacute asthma exacerbations. It does not induce systemic or \\nrespiratory side effects due to minimal systemic absorption, \\nthe latter as a result of inefficient absorption from the lungs \\nand gastrointestinal tract.25 It has been demonstrated in sev -\\neral systematic reviews to significantly improve pulmonary TABLE 21.3\\nMedications and Doses in Pediatric Acute Severe \\nAsthma\\nMedication Route Dose\\nBeta-Receptor Agonists\\nAlbuterol (salbutamol) Intermittent \\nnebulization0.15–0.3 mg/kg (up to 10 mg) \\nevery 1–4 h as needed5\\nContinuous \\nnebulization0.5 mg/(kg h) (up to 10 mg/h)5\\nLevalbuterol Intermittent \\nnebulization0.075–0.15 mg/kg (up to 5 mg) \\nevery 1–4 h as needed5\\nTerbutaline Intravenous 0.4–10 (μg/kg min)23\\nAnticholinergics\\nIpratropium bromide Intermittent \\nnebulization0.25–0.5 mg every 6 h76,77\\nCorticosteroids\\nMethylprednisolone Intravenous 1 mg/kg every 6 h (maximum \\n125 mg single dose)34,78\\nHydrocortisone Intravenous 2–4 mg/kg every 4–6 h4\\nOther\\nMagnesium sulfate Intravenous 25–40 mg/kg over 20 min \\n(maximum 2 g/dose)51,52\\nAminophylline Intravenous 6–8 mg/kg initial followed by \\n0.7–1.2 mg/(kg h) to maintain \\nserum concentrations of \\n10–15 mg/L79,80', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 238}),\n"," Document(page_content='221 Severe Acute and Life-Threatening Asthma in Children\\nfunction and clinical outcomes compared with the use of \\na beta-agonist alone.26–28 In a pooled analysis combining \\nadult and pediatric studies, Rodrigo and Castro-Rodriguez \\nshowed a dose–response relationship with a greater benefit \\nbeing achieved in patients treated with more than two doses \\nof anticholinergic agents in combination with a beta-agonist, \\nas reflected in hospital admission rates and pulmonary func -\\ntion.26 A few of the studies in children reported a significant \\nimprovement in clinical scores after combined treatment, \\nwith no apparent increase in side effects such as tremors or \\nheart rate. Asthma clinical pathways carried out in EDs in \\nthe management of children presenting with acute severe \\nasthma include administration of three doses of nebulized \\nalbuterol with ipratropium bromide within the first 60 min \\nof treatment.5 Anticholinergics are used in combination with \\nbeta-agonists to arrest progression to hypercapnic respira -\\ntory failure that requires PICU admission; once a patient is \\nmechanically ventilated, anticholinergics offer little benefit.29\\nCorticosteroids\\nAsthma is an inflammatory disease and corticosteroids \\nconstitute first-line treatment for acute severe asthma. \\nMechanisms of action of corticosteroids that render them \\nbeneficial in asthma are discussed in previous chapters. The \\nuse of inhaled corticosteroids at higher than maintenance \\ndoses has been explored in mitigating an exacerbation when \\ngiven at its onset; it has also been studied regarding its benefit \\nin acute management of patients seen in the ED.30,31 However, \\nthe data on the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in children \\nin these settings are inconsistent,32 perhaps due to inconsis -\\ntency of dosing. Smith et al., in a meta-analysis on the use of \\ncorticosteroids in children with acute severe asthma, stated \\nthat inhaled or nebulized corticosteroids cannot be recom -\\nmended as equivalent to systemic corticosteroids.33\\nFor acute severe asthma, systemic corticosteroids should \\nbe given promptly; beneficial effect becomes evident at 1–3 h \\nand maximal effects at 4–8 h after administration of the first \\ndose in conjunction with administration of beta-agonists.34 \\nMoreover, frequent dosing, typically four times daily, has \\nalso been found to be efficacious. Oral or parenteral cortico -\\nsteroids are equally efficacious; in the PICU setting however, \\nparenteral corticosteroids are preferred for critically ill chil -\\ndren, more so if they are intubated or unable to tolerate oral \\ndoses. Once the patient is extubated or stabilized and able to \\ntolerate oral intake and provided gastrointestinal transit time \\nand absorption are not impaired, switching from IV to oral \\ncorticosteroids may be considered.\\nThe more commonly used systemic corticosteroids include \\nIV hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone. Intramuscular \\ndexamethasone has been studied but mostly in the ER setting \\nand in comparison with oral prednisolone for treatment of \\nmoderate asthma exacerbations.35–38 Given its pharmacologic \\nproperties (i.e., biologic half-life of 36–72 h and systemic bio -\\navailability), it is usually given as a single intramuscular dose \\nand on some occasions by oral or nebulized routes.39 There is \\nno extra advantage to administering higher than conventional \\ndoses of corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone.40 In an adult study, hydrocortisone was found to be more effective \\nthan methylprednisolone regarding median duration of hos -\\npitalization and lung function.41 The total course of systemic \\ncorticosteroids for acute severe asthma may last from 3 to \\n10 days. For courses of less than 1 week, there is no need \\nto taper the dose; for slightly longer courses up to 10 days, \\nthere is probably no need to taper, especially if patients are \\nconcurrently using inhaled corticocosteroids.5 If treatment \\nis required for longer than 10 days, slow dosage taper is \\nrecommended.42\\nShort-term use of high-dose corticosteroids is usually not \\nassociated with significant adverse effects. Hyperglycemia, \\nhypertension, and acute psychosis have been reported.43 \\nConcerns regarding the immunosuppressive effects of corti -\\ncosteroids have been raised but are associated with long-term \\nuse. However, risk for fatal varicella has been reported with a \\nsingle course of corticosteroids.44\\nMagnesium\\nMagnesium can inhibit calcium uptake and result in smooth \\nmuscle relaxation and has therefore been used in the manage -\\nment of acute asthma, particularly in the ER setting. It can be \\ngiven intravenously or via nebulization. A Cochrane review \\nby Blitz et al. that included two studies conducted exclusively \\nin pediatric patients showed nebulized magnesium sulfate \\nin addition to beta-agonist improved pulmonary function in \\npatients with severe asthma and decreased hospitalization \\nrates.45 The use of IV magnesium for acute asthma was the \\nsubject of meta-analyses46–49 as well as other studies con -\\nducted in pediatric patients.50–52 These studies showed that \\nIV magnesium may reduce hospitalization rates among pedi -\\natric patients in status asthmaticus seen in the ED and should \\nbe considered in refractory patients with impending respira -\\ntory failure. The EPR-3 NIH guidelines recommend that IV \\nmagnesium sulfate may be considered to avoid intubation, \\nspecifically in patients who continue to present with severe \\nsymptoms after an hour of intensive conventional therapy.5\\nHelium–Oxygen\\nInhaled mixtures of helium–oxygen (heliox) containing up \\nto 60%–80% helium fraction lower the density of a gas and \\nreduce resistance during turbulent flow and, in the process, \\nallow better oxygen delivery to the distal airways. Similar \\nto the recommendation for the use of magnesium sulfate, \\nthe EPR-3 NIH guidelines state that for impending respira -\\ntory failure, heliox-driven albuterol nebulization should be \\nconsidered for patients who have life-threatening exacerba -\\ntion, specifically those who continue to present with severe \\nsymptoms after an hour of intensive conventional therapy.5 \\nHo et\\xa0al., in a systematic review that included two exclusively \\npediatric studies, found that heliox may offer mild to moder -\\nate benefits in patients with acute asthma within the first hour \\nof use; its effect may be more pronounced in more severe \\ncases.53 Similarly, from a Cochrane review, heliox treat -\\nment was shown not to play a role in the initial treatment of \\npatients with acute asthma; however, benefits were greater in \\npatients with more severe obstruction.54', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 239}),\n"," Document(page_content='222 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nMethylxanthines\\nMethylxanthines act as phosphodiesterase inhibitors result -\\ning in bronchodilation.

Their use, however, has \\nbeen limited, not just by availability of therapeutic options, \\nbut by their narrow therapeutic range and well-known tox -\\nicities.

Similar results \\nwere found by Yung and South insofar as improvements \\nin lung function and oxygen saturation within 6 and 30 h, \\nrespectively, in children given aminophylline after large \\ndoses of beta-agonists and corticosteroids were observed.56 \\nHowever, the EPR-3 NIH guidelines did not recommend the \\nuse of methylxanthines for severe exacerbations in ER or \\nhospital settings.5\\nLeukotriene Receptor Antagonists\\nThese drugs, available as tablets, have been typically used \\nas controller medications. Capsomidis and Tighe, in review -\\ning available studies in children, concluded that the use of \\noral montelukast is not currently recommended in moderate \\nto severe asthma exacerbations in children.57 The EPR-3 NIH \\nguidelines affirm this conclusion, stating there are insuffi -\\ncient data to recommend the use of IV leukotriene receptor \\nantagonists for moderate to severe exacerbations. A study \\nconducted by Camargo et al. in adult asthmatics with moder -\\nate and severe exacerbations demonstrated improvement in \\nlung function with the addition of IV montelukast to bron -\\nchodilators and corticosteroids.58\\nInhalational Anesthetics\\nVolatile anesthetics have beneficial effects on airway tone \\nand reactivity that include a direct effect on bronchial smooth \\nmuscle resulting in bronchodilatation.59–61 Other physiologi -\\ncal functions include decreased mean arterial pressure and \\nmyocardial contractility. The use of inhalational anesthetic \\nagents, notably isoflurane and halothane, in children pre -\\nsenting with acute severe asthma refractory to conventional \\nmeasures has been anecdotal.61–65 In a case series consist -\\ning of six pediatric patients,64 isoflurane was administered \\nusing a volume-limited Servo 900D ventilator with an \\nattached vaporizer that delivered the anesthetic; the authors recommended monitoring of end tidal CO2 and placement \\nof central venous and arterial catheters as well as consider -\\nation of inline monitoring of isoflurane concentration. More \\nrecently, in a retrospective review over 15 years that included \\npatients with a mean age of 9.5 years, Turner et al. concluded \\nthat isoflurane appeared to be an effective therapy in patients \\nwith life-threatening bronchospasm refractory to conven -\\ntional therapy, although the overall impact remained uncer -\\ntain; the majority of patients developed hypotension but there \\nwas a low incidence of side effects.66\\nventIlatory  support\\nAbsolute indications for intubation include cardiopulmonary \\narrest, severe hypoxia, and rapid deterioration in the patient’s \\nmental status.3 Progressive respiratory fatigue despite maxi -\\nmal pharmacotherapy including noninvasive techniques con -\\nstitutes a relative indication for intubation and mechanical \\nventilation.

Newth et al. found no increased \\nrisk for postextubation complications in children who were \\nintubated using cuffed endotracheal tubes.67 The intubated \\npatient receiving mechanical ventilation requires sedation \\n(usually with opioids, benzodiazepines or propofol) to avoid \\nventilator dyssynchrony. The use of neuromuscular blockade \\nshould be considered for patients in whom adequate venti -\\nlation cannot be achieved despite acceptable ventilatory \\npressures or settings.

Adverse \\nreactions caused by medications are discussed in the pre -\\nvious section on Management. In a retrospective study, \\nCarroll and Zucker identified common complications such \\nas aspiration pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, \\nbarotrauma (e.g., pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax), \\nand rhabdomyolysis; intubated children were significantly \\nmore likely than nonintubated children to experience a com -\\nplication with duration of mechanical ventilation being an \\nimportant factor.72 They found that the use of positive pres -\\nsure is associated with an increased risk of barotrauma in \\nchildren regardless of whether this was provided by nonin -\\nvasive means or via mechanical ventilation through an endo -\\ntracheal tube. In the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care \\nResearch Network (CPCCRN) study, 12% of patients admit -\\nted to the PICU had complications; the majority of the com -\\nplications consisted of central nervous system deficits and a \\nquarter of the patients developed barotrauma.1 Neuropathy \\nwas also reported in a few patients.\\nMechanical ventilation has been found to be a risk fac -\\ntor for rhabdomyolysis, especially in older children, through \\na mechanism similar to the pathogenesis of exercise-related \\nrhabdomyolysis,73 and can present acutely. The use of sys -\\ntemic corticosteroids and neuromuscular blockers may add \\nto the risk of rhabdomyolysis, such that creatine phosphiki -\\nnase should be monitored in children with acute respiratory \\nfailure. A case of subarachnoid hemorrhage was reported in \\nassociation with the use of permissive hypercapnia for acute \\nrespiratory failure.74\\nRegarding mortality, the CPCCRN study cited a mortality \\nrate of 4% with cause of death listed as anoxic brain injury \\n(in the majority), cardiac arrest, pneumonia, and multiple \\norgan failure.1\\nPROGNOSIS AND FOLLOW-UP\\nAdmission to the PICU for asthma is a predictor of hospi -\\ntal readmission. Moreover, risk factors for mortality from \\nasthma have been discussed in ‘Risk Factors’ and listed in \\nTable  21.2.\\nUsing data from the Centers for Disease Control and \\nPrevention, Akinbami et al. described trends among asth -\\nmatic children 0–17 years of age; they cited that asthma-\\nrelated deaths increased through the mid-1990s but decreased \\nafter 1999.2 In a study that followed up pediatric patients \\nadmitted to the PICU over a 15-year period, 5% of patients who received mechanical ventilation for asthma during their \\nindex admission died within 10 years of discharge;75 risk fac -\\ntors for subsequent mortality included multiple ICU admis -\\nsions, persistent asthma, and ventilation at admission. In the \\nsame study, risk factors for ICU admission were admission \\nfor asthma in the preceding year and ventilation at admission.\\nThus, patients admitted to the PICU for acute severe \\nasthma require close follow-up upon discharge, especially if \\nthey required mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk \\nfor subsequent mortality. It is imperative that all asthmatic \\npatients who are discharged from the hospital are provided \\nwith adequate education and written plans that encompass \\na list of medications, follow-up appointments with primary \\ncare providers and specialists, and recognition and initial \\nmanagement of an exacerbation. The importance of patient \\nand parent or caregiver education cannot be overemphasized. \\nAn acknowledgment of the life-threatening complications of \\nasthma can be the starting point of the education process that \\nwill help underscore the importance of adherence to medica -\\ntions and follow-up, understanding of the concept of control -\\nler and rescue medications, and even renewed efforts toward \\nenvironmental controls and attention to avoidable triggers. \\nA review of medications should include a demonstration of \\ninhaler technique and appropriate feedback, especially with \\nregard to inhaled medications that require nebulization or the \\nuse of spacer devices. A peak flow meter may be considered \\nin children who are at least 5 years of age (and their parents \\nor caregivers), those who have a history of severe exacerba -\\ntions, those who have moderate or severe persistent asthma, \\nand those who poorly perceive airflow obstruction or worsen -\\ning asthma.5\\nREFERENCES\\n 1.

most common chronic health conditions \\nand is characterized by variable airflow obstruction. Not sur -\\nprisingly, patients with asthma suffer intermittent exacerba -\\ntions followed by variable degrees of “stability.” Asthma is an \\ninflammatory disease of the airways, with many symptoms \\nresulting from secondary bronchoconstriction and is a classic \\nexample of a gene–environment interaction. It is a multifac -\\ntorial disease influenced by geography (regional variation is \\nwell documented), heredity, early environmental influences \\nand exposures, demographic factors (e.g., age, sex, and eth -\\nnicity), lifestyle choices (e.g., smoking status and body mass \\nindex), the environment (e.g., living conditions and air quality), \\nand socioeconomic status. Not surprisingly, the prevalence of \\nasthma varies widely within and among countries; however, \\nacute severe asthma occurs everywhere and its management \\nhas evolved dramatically over the past two decades.\\nDespite rapid advances in the understanding of the \\npathophysiology and management of asthma, the control of \\nasthma has proven to be difficult to achieve. A deterioration \\nin asthma control is common when patients are exposed to \\nairway irritants and viruses, and when adherence to chronic \\nanti-inflammatory medications is suboptimal. The hallmark \\nof an exacerbation includes a history of asthma, increasing \\nsymptoms of dyspnea, wheeze, and cough, and an increas -\\ning need for short-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (SABA) \\nagents. Asthma exacerbations are common presentations \\nto the ED in many parts of the world1 and the costs associ -\\nated with the care of asthma are significant.2–4 For example, \\nin the United States, approximately $14 billion per year is \\nspent on asthma5; nearly one-quarter of all asthma expenses \\nis related to acute exacerbations (ED visits and hospitaliza -\\ntions).4 Severe acute asthma  is a potentially life-threatening \\nmedical emergency that usually involves symptoms such as \\nshortness of breath, cough, and wheeze, and signs such as \\naccessory muscles use, tachypnea and tachycardia, airway \\noutflow measures (PEF or forced expiratory volume in 1 sec \\n[FEV1]) <50% of predicted, and arterial saturation <90%.\\nGiven this major economic and health burden, it is not \\nsurprising that a number of guidelines have been developed \\nto guide the management of asthma and its severe exacer -\\nbations.6–10 However, despite the widespread availability of \\nasthma guidelines, there is a “care gap” between what is \\npracticed and the published evidence. Frequently, evidence \\nsummaries are unavailable for guiding the management of \\npatients in the ED or other acute care settings. This is due, in \\npart, to the volume of literature and perhaps a lack of access \\nto synthesized evidence by clinicians. Moreover, disparities \\nin terms of health-care access (patients often cannot afford \\nthe appropriate medicines) and education (some patients do \\nnot know that it is possible to live well with asthma) continue \\nto complicate the management of asthma.\\nThis chapter focuses on summarizing the evidence for \\nthe management of severe acute asthma in the ED and fol -\\nlowing discharge. The approach outlined here may enable \\nclinicians to help their asthma patients avoid ED visits and hospitalizations, limit airway interventions, reduce relapses, \\nand improve long-term asthma control.\\nACUTE ASTHMA ED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY\\nSeveral large-scale studies have examined the presentations \\nof patients with asthma to EDs. Using the National Hospital \\nAmbulatory Medical Care Survey, investigators in the United \\nStates have demonstrated stable numbers of ED presenta -\\ntions,11 while Canadian studies have shown a decreasing rate \\nof asthma presentations to the ED.12 In addition, two inves -\\ntigator groups have demonstrated various factors associated \\nwith hospitalization (see Table 22.1). Multivariate modeling \\ntechniques have provided a list of factors associated with \\nadmission. These results suggest that the patient’s ethnicity, \\nage, sex, asthma severity (respiratory rate, SaO2, and triage \\nscores), past history of asthma control (e.g., intubations and \\nasthma admissions), and previous outpatient unscheduled \\noffice and ED visits requiring the use of oral corticosteroids \\nare all factors associated with an increased risk for hospital -\\nization. Overall, clinicians should consider these risk factors \\nwhen making admission and discharge decisions for patients \\nwith asthma managed in the acute care setting.\\nacute asthMa assess Ment\\nEstimates of the disease severity, the need for hospitaliza -\\ntion, and the risk of relapse following discharge by physicians \\nare often inaccurate in acute asthma. Although the assess -\\nment of asthma severity is recommended by all major acute \\nasthma guidelines,6,7 there is disagreement on the most suit -\\nable approach. Some guidelines recommend that the severity \\nbe determined objectively using spirometry, PEF, or both.7 \\nWhile there is conflicting evidence regarding the psychomet -\\nric properties of each of these measures,13 many EDs measure \\nthe PEF rate rather than FEV1, and follow this clinical mea -\\nsure of severity over the course of treatment. The cut points \\nfor severity vary among the different guidelines; however, all \\nthe guidelines suggest that <30%–50% predicted of either the \\nPEF or FEV1 indicates severe disease. A more important con -\\nsideration for ED clinicians relates to the change in pulmo -\\nnary function over the acute treatment period. Finally, most \\nguidelines suggest that the ED target for discharge be at least \\n70% of the predicted lung function, which may not always be \\nfeasible especially in patients with moderate to severe fixed \\nairway obstruction.6,7\\nVital signs (temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and \\nblood pressure) may be helpful in assessing severe acute \\nasthma. A “fifth vital sign,” SaO2 measured by pulse oxim -\\netry, should also be recorded. While vital signs are considered \\nhelpful, they may provide misleading information in adults. \\nFor example, normal or near normal vital signs do not exclude \\nsevere asthma or the possibility of a post-ED relapse. While \\nthe measurement of SaO2 may help to guide treatment in adult \\npatients, no studies have clearly demonstrated that SaO2 pre-\\ndicts admission or relapse in adult asthmatic patients.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 246}),\n"," Document(page_content='229 Severe Acute and Life-Threatening Asthma in Adults\\nSophisticated investigations are rarely required for the \\nmanagement of patients with acute asthma, and clinical \\nassessment over time is far more important than wasting \\ntime and resources by ordering tests. Since patients pre -\\nsenting with acute asthma are generally young and have \\nfew comorbidities, laboratory tests, radiography, and other \\nmore sophisticated tests are less important than initiating \\nthe appropriate treatment.\\nIn summary, the assessment of acute asthma severity \\nrequires a careful and multifactorial approach. The use of \\npulse oximetry, pulmonary function tests, vital signs, his -\\ntory, physical examination, previous and current responses \\nto therapy, and current medications are all required to deter -\\nmine the need for hospitalization and the risk of relapse after \\ndischarge.\\nTHERAPEUTIC MANAGEMENT OF \\nSEVERE ACUTE ASTHMA IN THE ED\\nbeta2-agon Ist bronchod Ilators\\nThe early treatment of acute asthma has generally focused \\non the use of inhaled SABA agents because of their undisputed and generally rapid bronchodilation effect. The \\ntherapeutic advantages of the most common delivery meth -\\nods, which are nebulizers or MDIs with a holding cham -\\nber or a spacer device, have been extensively investigated. \\nA Cochrane library systematic review, updated in 2008, \\ninvolving 614 adults from 27 trials from EDs and com -\\nmunity settings suggested that the use of either delivery \\nmethod for acute (but not acute severe) asthma yields simi -\\nlar clinical outcomes.14 In adults, the relative risk (RR) of \\nadmission or poor outcome for a holding chamber versus \\na nebulizer was 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63, \\n1.49). The ED length of stay for adults and FEV1 or PEF \\nmeasurements posttreatment were also similar for the two \\ndelivery methods (Figure 22.1). Furthermore, the use of a \\nMDI with a holding chamber was associated with fewer \\nside effects, such as tachycardia and tremor, compared with \\nnebulizers, especially in children. An economic evaluation \\nof these two delivery approaches has demonstrated that \\nSABA delivery by a MDI with a holding chamber is more \\ncost-effective compared with a nebulizer.15 An important \\ncaveat is that the clinical trials included in the systematic \\nreview did not include patients with status asthmaticus  or \\nnear-fatal asthma.TABLE 22.1\\nFactors Associated with Hospital Admission for Acute Asthma Following ED \\nManagement in Large Multicentered Studies\\nFactors U.S. Data Canadian Data\\nDemographics\\nAge — ↑/10 years***\\nSex ↑ if female** —\\nRace/ethnicity ↑ if black* —\\nSeverity\\nPulmonary functions ↑ per increase of 10% predicted initial PEF*** —\\nTriage score — ↑ if CTAS 1 or 2 at presentation***\\nHome SABA treatments ↑ if home nebulizer during past 4 weeks*** ↑ if >8 activations in past 24 h*\\nOxygen saturation ↑ if <95%***\\nRespiratory rate ↑with every 5 breaths/min increment** ↑ if >22/min**\\nPast History\\nPrevious admissions — ↑ if any admissions*\\nEver intubated ↑ if intubated* —\\nCorticosteroid use ↑ if on chronic CS*\\n↑ if on pulse CS*—\\nAsthma medication ↑ if used more than ICS and SABA in past \\n4 weeks**—\\nED Treatment\\nSABA treatment in the ED ↑ if any*** —\\nPulmonary functions ↑ per decrease of 10% predicted final PEF*** —\\nNote:  CS, corticosteroids; CTAS, Canadian Triage and Acuity Score; ICS, inhaled corticosteroids; ED, emergency \\ndepartment; PEF, peak expiratory flow; ABA, short-acting beta-agonists.\\n*P < .5; ** P < .01; *** P < .001.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 247}),\n"," Document(page_content='230 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nThe attempts to identify optimal doses or treatment inter -\\nvals to achieve maximal bronchodilation or symptom relief \\nhave not been successful.16 In addition, lower SABA doses \\nappear to be equivalent to higher doses of up to 5–10 mg \\nvia a nebulizer in achieving maximum clinical outcomes.17 \\nClinicians often observe a “plateau” in bronchodilation, sug -\\ngesting that continued SABA treatment may produce more \\nadverse effects rather than additional bronchodilation. Some \\nguidelines now recommend titrating SABA use to a plateau \\nusing an objective assessment of the airway obstruction with \\npulmonary function measures.10\\ndelIvery Methods  for beta-agon Ists\\nThe recommended delivery of SABA bronchodilators is \\nthrough the inhaled route as previously described. The need to focus on other management issues may make nebuliza -\\ntion the most attractive delivery method in patients with \\nsevere acute asthma. When patients present with severe \\nacute asthma, clinicians attempt to maximize bronchodila -\\ntion, and the penetration of an inhaled drug to the affected \\nsmall airways may be limited. The evidence suggests that \\nseveral alternative considerations are available, such as con -\\ntinuous nebulization and IV delivery. The theory behind the \\ncontinuous delivery of SABA is that the bolus of intermittent \\nadministration may produce the bronchodilation required \\nfor the effective delivery of other inhaled agents. A sys -\\ntematic review involving the continuous delivery of beta-\\nagonists supports this approach as one option for patients \\nwith severe acute asthma.18 The theory behind the use of \\nIV agents is that their effectiveness in acute severe asthma \\nmay be the result of beta2-receptor activation through the Review :  Holding chamb ers (spacers) versus nebulizers for b eta-agonist tr eatment of acute a sthm a\\nComparison: One spacer ( chamb er) versus nebulizer (multiple treatment studies)\\nOutcome: One ho spital admission\\nStudy or sub group Holding chamb er\\nn/NNebulizer\\nn/NRisk ratio\\nM-H, ﬁxed, 95% C lRisk ratio\\nM-H, ﬁxed, 95% C l\\n1 Adults\\nColacone (l993) 1/40 0/40 3.00 [0.13, 71.51]\\nIdris (1993) 1/15 1/20 1.33 [0.09, 19.64]\\nRaimondi (1997) 0/9 0/9 0.0 [0.0, 0.0]\\nRao (2002) 0/25 1/25 0.33 [0.01, 7.81]\\nRodrigo (1993) 5/49 4/48 1.22 [0.35, 4.29]\\nRodriguez (1999) 14/36 17/33 0.75 [0.45, 1.28]\\nTurner (1988) 4/27 5/26 0.77 [0.23, 2.56]\\nVivek (2003) 5/68 1/54 3.97 [0.48, 32.98]\\nSubtotal (95 % Cl ) 269 255 0.97 [0.63, 1.49]\\nTotal events: 30 (holding chamb er), 29 (nebulizer)\\nHeterogeneity : Chi2 = 3.82, df = 6 (P = .70); l2 = 0.0%\\nTest for overall eﬀ ect: Z = 0.15 (P = .88)\\n2 Children\\nChong-Neto (2005) 0/20 0/10 0.0 [0.0, 0.0]\\nChou (1995) 4/71 5/81 0.91 [0.25, 3.27]\\nJamalvi (2006) 4/84 7/66 0.45 [0.14, 1.47]\\nLeversha (2000) 10/30 18/30 0.56 [0.31, 1.00]\\nPloin (2000) 3/31 3/32 1.03 [0.23, 4.73]\\nSannier (2007) 6/39 3/40 2.05 [0.55, 7.63]\\nVazquez (1992) 0/9 0/9 0.0 [0.0, 0.0]\\nWilliams (1996) 2/42 2/18 0.43 [0.07, 2.81]\\nSubtotal (95 % Cl) 326 286 0.72 [0.47, 1.09]\\nTotal events: 29 (holding chamb er), 38 (nebulizer)\\nHeterogeneity : Chi2 = 4.43, df = 5 (P = .49); l2 = 0.0%\\nTest for overall eﬀ ect: Z = 1.55 (P = .12)\\nTotal (95 % Cl) 595 541\\n0.01 0.1 11 0 100\\nChamb er betterN ebulizer b etter0.83 [0.61, 1.12]\\nTotal events: 59 (holding chamb er), 67 (nebulizer)\\nHeterogeneity : Chi2 = 8.90, df = 12 (P = .71); l2 = 0.0%\\nTest for overall eﬀ ect: Z = 1.24 (P =  .22)\\nFIGURE 22.1  The effectiveness of short-acting beta-agonist delivery by an inhaler and a spacer device compared with a nebulizer (admis -\\nsion outcome).

In these circumstances, if bronchodila -\\ntion occurs predominantly in response to the systemic dis -\\ntribution of the drug, the addition of IV bronchodilators to \\nthe inhaled administration of bronchodilators may provide \\nan earlier clinical response.19\\nA recent systematic review of the published literature in \\nadult and pediatric cases suggests that the IV route should \\nbe used cautiously.20 The evidence is based on the results of \\na few randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and the benefit \\nappears to be limited to pediatric cases.

The \\nmajority of patients should be managed with inhaled \\nSABA delivery through a MDI and a holding chamber. \\nSupporting this recommendation for limiting SABA treat -\\nment via a nebulizer is the recent worldwide severe acute \\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza pan -\\ndemics and their apparent spread following nebulization,21 \\nwhich in some settings has facilitated the conversion to a \\nMDI with a holding chamber.\\nantIchol Inerg Ic bronchod Ilators\\nShort-acting anticholinergic agents (SAAC) are broncho -\\ndilators that also reduce pulmonary secretions. There is \\nsupport for adding  SAAC agents to SABA therapy in mod -\\nerate to severe acute asthma in children22 and adults.23 A \\nsystematic review involving 2047 patients from 16 trials of \\nacute asthma identified a beneficial effect of adding SAAC \\n(most often ipratropium bromide) to inhaled SABA agents in \\nthe early treatment of adults with acute asthma. The risk of \\nadmission was decreased by 32% (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.53, \\n0.99) and the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent a sin -\\ngle admission was 14 (95% CI: 9, 30). Multiple doses (more \\nthan two) of SAAC reduced the risk of hospital admission \\nby 47% (RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.7683) and the NNT to \\nprevent a single admission was 6 (95% CI: 4, 13). The effect \\nwas not related to the use of systemic corticosteroids (SCs); \\nhowever, the evidence regarding their role in severe asthma \\nwas inconclusive.\\nThe review provided pooled results to suggest that pul -\\nmonary function also improved in patients treated with a \\nSAAC/SABA combination compared with the control SABA \\ngroup. Overall, short-term treatment with SAAC is exceed -\\ningly safe, inexpensive, and readily available in most centers. \\nAlthough several questions regarding SAAC in acute asthma \\nremain unresolved (such as the dose–response relationship), \\nevidence supports adding SAAC to SABA for patients with \\nsevere acute asthma.cortIcostero Ids\\nMost patients with severe acute asthma have impressive \\nairway edema and increased secretions resulting from the \\ninflammation cascade. Therefore, almost all of these patients \\nwarrant early, aggressive anti-inflammatory treatments. For \\nexample, SCs delivered early (i.e., within 2 h of arrival) is a \\nfirst-line treatment in most current published asthma guide -\\nlines.8,9,10,24–25 A Cochrane systematic review consisting of \\n12 RCTs and involving a total of 863 patients with acute \\nasthma concluded that SCs significantly reduced admissions \\n(odds ratio [OR] = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.81) compared with \\na placebo or standard care; the NNT was 8 (95% CI: 5, 20).26 \\nThis benefit was more pronounced for corticosteroid-naive \\npatients (OR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.70) and those experienc -\\ning a severe attack (OR = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.59). Overall, \\nshort-term treatment with SCs is exceedingly safe, inexpen -\\nsive, and readily available in most centers. Moreover, the \\ndelivery of this treatment can be safely initiated by both tri -\\nage nurses27 and other health professionals prior to physician \\nassessment,28 in order to ensure drug delivery at the earliest \\npossible time.\\nCurrent treatment options for physicians include using IV, \\nintramuscular (IM), and oral SCs in severe disease. While \\nmost evidence-based clinicians use oral agents (e.g., predni -\\nsone or dexamethasone), in certain situations an IV route of \\nadministration may be preferable. For example, IV cortico -\\nsteroids should be considered for patients who have severe \\nor near-fatal asthma, are too dyspneic to swallow, have a \\ndecreased level of consciousness, are intubated or in the pro -\\ncess of being intubated, and are unable to tolerate oral medi -\\ncations (e.g., severe nausea, gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding, \\nand vomiting). Unfortunately, systematic reviews in hospi -\\ntalized patients are underpowered to conclude superiority or \\nequivalence regarding high versus moderate doses.\\nOverall, it seems appropriate to provide oral SCs to almost \\nall other patients with acute asthma. The agent and dose of SC \\nadministered should be based on familiarity, availability, and \\npatient factors. Most importantly, clinicians need to start SCs \\nearly and consistently for patients with severe acute asthma.\\nMgso4\\nIV MgSO4 is a treatment option for a variety of severe \\nacute diseases such as eclampsia, cardiac arrhythmias, and \\nasthma. In asthma, it has both a direct effect on the smooth \\nmuscles through its influence on cellular calcium homeosta -\\nsis, and a proposed airway anti-inflammatory effect. The use \\nof IV MgSO4 in unresponsive patients with acute asthma has \\ngained support over the past decade. A number of system -\\natic reviews have all concluded that IV magnesium is not \\nonly safe but it is also effective in those patients with severe \\ndisease.29,30 Overall, 13 studies (8 adults; 5 children) involv -\\ning 965 patients have examined the addition  of IV MgSO4 \\nto SABA and SCs. Considering all the studies, the addition \\nof MgSO4 reduced hospitalization; however, significant het -\\nerogeneity was identified (I2 = 47.6%; Figure 22.2).

While this \\nis compelling evidence, a clinically more important ques -\\ntion involves the benefit of adding ICS to SCs.

Overall, the ICS \\ntreatments were well tolerated.\\nSince the combination subgroup exhibited moderate \\nheterogeneity (I2 = 52%), caution when interpreting these \\nresults is advised. ICS agents should not be the first-line \\ntreatment in acute asthma; however, they may assist in more \\nsevere asthma, especially if patients have not previously \\nbeen on SCs prior to ED presentation. The dose, frequency, \\nand agents used in this review varied widely; however, there \\nappears to be evidence of effect despite this heterogeneity. \\nFor example, various ICS agents were used (budesonide in \\n14 studies), the median single dose was 900 μg, the median \\nfrequency of treatment was two activations, and the median \\ncumulative dose was 2 mg over up to 6 h of observation.32\\nadjuvant  agents\\nIM epinephrine injections have been recommended in acute \\nallergic reactions and may benefit patients whose acute asthma \\nis suspected or known to be due to possible anaphylaxis.33 While long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) and \\nleukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) are recommended \\nas add-on therapy in chronic, poorly controlled asthma,34 \\nresearch in acute asthma is limited. An RCT of 201 patients \\ntreated with either a placebo or 7 or 14 mg of IV montelukast \\nsuggested a clinically significant improvement in FEV1 within \\n10 min of administration;35 however, other evidence-based \\ntreatments were not administered to all patients. Another \\nstudy examined treatments in the ED and after discharge.36 \\nOverall, the evidence for this treatment is limited and whether \\nits use should be encouraged in addition  to SCs remains \\nuncertain. As the evidence regarding the use of both LTRA \\nand LABA agents accumulates, clinicians are encouraged to \\nsearch for updates of existing systematic reviews.\\nAIRWAY INTERVENTIONS\\nDespite the use of aggressive management as outlined earlier, \\nin rare cases some patients will continue to deteriorate and \\ndecisions regarding the need for assisted ventilation will be \\nrequired.\\nnonInvas Ive ventIlatIon (nIv)\\nExperienced clinicians in the ED setting have become accus -\\ntomed to using NIV (also referred to as noninvasive positive \\npressure ventilation [NIPPV]) for patients with respiratory \\nfailure, especially in the setting of heart failure and chronic \\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).37,38 NIV is usually \\ndelivered by a partial or full-face mask, in the form of bipha -\\nsic respiratory support. While the evidence to support this \\nintervention in COPD and heart failure, based on data pooled \\nfrom multiple small RCTs, demonstrates homogeneous effi -\\ncacious outcomes, the evidence in acute asthma is sparse. In \\nfact, a Cochrane systematic review updated in 2012 identi -\\nfied 5 studies involving 206 participants; however, not all \\nstudies contributed to every outcome assessed. From two \\nstudies involving 90 patients, endotracheal intubation was \\nnot reduced using NIV (OR = 4.81; 95% CI: 0.22, 105.2). \\nHospital admissions were reduced using NIV in one study \\n(OR = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.64); however, a meta-analysis \\ncould not be performed on the length-of-stay data from two \\nstudies. There were no deaths reported in any studies. While \\nthe body of evidence is positive,39 recent reviews have gener -\\nated neutral recommendations.40 The benefits of NIV in this \\nsetting and its success in similar respiratory failure cases due \\nto other common acute conditions suggest a definitive trial of \\nNIV in severe acute asthma may be warranted.

While rapid \\nsequence intubation with ketamine is recommended, it must \\nbe stressed that preparation and airway expertise are essen -\\ntial for a successful, nontraumatic intubation. The airway \\nsettings, the techniques of mechanical ventilation, the use of \\nheliox, the timing of extubation, and other airway consider -\\nations are covered more comprehensively elsewhere.41\\nOTHER OPTIONS FOR MANAGING \\nACUTE SEVERE ASTHMA\\nOver the years, many treatments have been used and advo -\\ncated that now require only a passing mention due to their lack \\nof effectiveness. For example, while methylxanthines were \\noften used in the treatment of acute severe asthma, the overall \\nscientific evidence suggests that aminophylline (the main IV \\nagent in this class) is ineffective.42 Moreover, the side effects \\nassociated with this agent outweigh any benefit that may be \\nobserved; therefore, this agent is no longer considered an \\nappropriate treatment for severe acute asthma.\\nAntibiotics have been used excessively and often inap -\\npropriately in the past in both emergency and primary care \\nsettings to treat bronchitis43 and asthma. A summary of the \\nevidence to date would suggest that antibiotics are ineffective \\nin the treatment of severe acute asthma.44 The use of anti -\\nbiotics for severe acute asthma should therefore be limited \\nto patients with documented fever, purulent sputum, and \\nan infiltrate on chest radiography, or evidence of another \\nsource of bacterial infection requiring antibiotics (e.g., acute \\nsinusitis).\\nOther agents such as heliox45 and inhaled MgSO446 are \\ncurrently not recommended because the evidence is insuf -\\nficient to demonstrate a clear benefit to treatment.\\nMANAGEMENT OF SEVERE ACUTE ASTHMA \\nIN PREPARATION FOR ED DISCHARGE\\nWhile it could be argued that evidence-based management \\nof severe presentations is the most important treatment of \\nED patients with acute asthma, the frequency of improve -\\nment leading to the eventual discharge of the majority of \\nthese patients suggests that this should also be an important \\nfocus for all emergency physicians.47 In this regard, arrang -\\ning follow-up with the patients’ usual physician and/or family \\npractitioner is essential for ensuring continuity of care and \\npreventing recidivism to the ED (see also Chapter 29).\\nsyste MIc cortIcostero Ids\\nCorticosteroids are nonspecific, anti-inflammatory agents \\ncommonly used in asthma. In a Cochrane systematic review \\nof RCTs, the risk of relapse and the need for a rescue ther -\\napy were significantly reduced with SCs compared with a placebo.48 In addition, the evidence would suggest that the \\nbenefit of SCs extends beyond the traditional 5–7 days of \\ntreatment and also reduces the need for rescue beta-agonists \\nover the first 3 weeks postdischarge. Since oral corticoste -\\nroids are relatively safe, inexpensive, and effective, this \\nshould be the first-line agent for patients with moderate to \\nsevere asthma discharged from the ED after treatment.\\nAt times, adherence with this treatment can be difficult \\nand there is some evidence to suggest that in the case of \\npatients where compliance or access to medications may be \\nproblematic, there is a role for IM injections of corticoste -\\nroids. Approximately five trials have been published in this \\narea, which generally suggest a reduction in relapse following \\nthe use of IM agents such as triamcinolone, dexamethasone, \\nand methylprednisolone.49 As the majority of patients with \\nacute severe asthma would prefer to ingest a tablet rather than \\nreceive an IM injection, this form of therapy is infrequently \\nused. It is, however, an option in settings where access to \\nmedications or compliance may be problematic.\\nThe duration of oral therapy is debated and while the cur -\\nrent evidence is based on 7–10 days of treatment in the RCTs, \\nincluding the Cochrane review, the current form of reduced \\ntherapy is more acceptable to patients and physicians. The evi -\\ndence from large observational ED studies has demonstrated \\nthe use of a median of 5 days of therapy and rarely more than \\n7 days of therapy with oral agents.47 In some cases, short \\ncourses of dexamethasone are used50; however, this is more \\ncommon in the pediatric setting where the tolerance for SC \\nagents is poor. While a recent questionnaire study investigat -\\ning physician use of oral SCs demonstrated a heterogeneous \\napproach, it also revealed that most physicians prescribed \\nless than the upper dose recommended in the guidelines and \\nmany prescribed a total SC burst dose below the lower end of \\nthe recommended dose range.51 Further studies should focus \\non the optimal treatment regimen of oral SCs in the manage -\\nment of acute severe asthma to help establish a better overall \\nconsensus among physicians. While the side-effect profile of \\noral SCs is reasonably safe, patients should still be advised \\nof the potential side effects such as abdominal discomfort, \\nand in some cases a GI bleed, insomnia, hyperphagia, and \\nexacerbation of chronic mental health disorders.\\nInhaled  cortIcostero Ids\\nWhile moderate-dose ICS is considered standard treat -\\nment for chronic asthma, there are a surprising number of \\npatients presenting with chronic, poorly controlled asthma \\nwho are not receiving ICS agents or are not adhering to \\nthe recommendations for using these agents.47 The addi -\\ntion of ICS to SCs at discharge is now relatively common \\nin some settings. The evidence for a management strategy \\noriginated from an RCT in the ED setting,52 and was further \\nfortified in a systematic review in the Cochrane library.50 \\nThe first major clinical trial on this topic was conducted in \\nCanada52 and included 188 asthmatic patients presenting to \\na community ED. All patients received a concomitant 7-day \\ncourse of prednisone daily at discharge.

The study \\nexamined moderate to severe asthmatic patients considered \\nwell enough for discharge after treatment. The addition of \\nhigh-dose budesonide decreased the 21-day relapse propor -\\ntions (12.8% vs. 24.5%; P = .04; NNT = 9). An improved \\nquality of life and a reduced SABA puffer use (2.4 vs. 4.2 \\npuffs/day) were also observed.\\nDespite these early and promising results, similar trials \\nhave failed to confirm these findings. In a Cochrane sys -\\ntematic review summarizing the evidence for ICS treatment \\nafter discharge from the ED, three RCTs were identified and \\npooled. The meta-analysis provided a nonsignificant trend \\nin favor of adding ICS to corticosteroids after discharge \\n(OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.46, 1.02).50 Combined with admin -\\nistrative data evidence53 that suggests ICS agents should be \\nadded to reduce relapse after discharge and current guide -\\nlines for the control of patients with chronic asthma, the \\nmajority of patients seen in the ED with an acute exacerba -\\ntion of their asthma qualify for treatment with moderate-dose \\nICS agents.\\nThe exact agent, dose, and duration of ICS after discharge \\nremain unclear. The current recommendation from the \\nchronic asthma literature suggests that doses above moder -\\nate ICS are not beneficial.54 The ICS recommendations fol -\\nlowing discharge from the ED are based on a consensus and \\nlikely should be moderate to high doses.\\naddItIon of laba\\nIn the treatment of chronic asthma, disease control may be \\nachieved with the addition of inhaled LABA to the regu -\\nlar use of ICS agents.55 The exact role of LABA in the ED \\nremains a topic of debate. In an RCT of 137 patients dis -\\ncharged from a Canadian ED with acute asthma, patients \\nadministered LABA in combination with ICS, compared \\nwith ICS alone, fared no better after discharge.56 In an a pri -\\nori subgroup analysis, those patients who were not receiving \\nICS at presentation to the ED did not appear to benefit from \\nthe addition of ICS plus LABA after discharge. For example, \\napproximately 5% of patients suffered relapse if adminis -\\ntered ICS agents in combination with prednisone after dis -\\ncharge. Conversely, patients who were already receiving ICS \\nagents at the time of presentation to the ED appeared to ben -\\nefit more from a switch to an ICS/LABA combination agent. \\nIn this study, patients who were already receiving ICS agents \\nat presentation to the ED had a nonsignificant 50% reduction \\nin relapse in the subsequent 3 weeks and also an improve -\\nment in their quality of life.\\nGiven the current guideline recommendations to add a \\nLABA agent to ICS in patients with unstable asthma, includ -\\ning exacerbations, this may be an appropriate ED treatment \\noption. Further research is clearly required and whether these \\npatients need to remain on the ICS/LABA combination long \\nterm is still undetermined. Clearly, the majority of patients do \\nnot need ICS/LABA long term and it is important to ensure \\nthat asthma education, close follow-up, and compliance with medications are included in a comprehensive effort to \\nachieve asthma control.\\nPOST-ED DISCHARGE MANAGEMENT\\nprevent Ing relapse\\nSince relapse after discharge is an important outcome for \\npatients with asthma, several studies have attempted to \\nidentify the factors associated with this outcome. A large, \\nmulticenter ED study of patients with acute asthma identi -\\nfied the factors associated with relapse after discharge57; \\nhowever, standard evidence-based treatments were not pro -\\nvided in all cases. A prospective, observational study of \\npatients discharged from Canadian EDs with high follow-up \\nand frequent discharge treatment with SCs and ICS agents \\ndocumented relapses in 9.2% of patients in 1 week (95% \\nCI: 7.1%–12.0%) and nearly 14% (95% CI: 11%–17%) in \\n2 weeks.47 Multivariate modeling of factors associated with \\nrelapse produced a list of factors associated with relapse after \\ndischarge. These results suggest that patient characteristics \\n(i.e., ethnicity and sex), exacerbation frequency (i.e., prior ED \\nvisits and asthma admissions), and treatment (i.e., use of oral \\ncorticosteroids) factors were associated with asthma relapse. \\nOverall, acute care providers should consider these risk fac -\\ntors in their discharge decisions.\\nprevent Ing future  presentat Ions to the ed\\nDespite applying the evidence as outlined in this chapter, asthma \\ncontrol can be elusive for many patients. Nonpharmacological \\nmanagement issues need to be considered in all patients seen \\nin the ED.

In addition, \\nmany patients have not received influenza immunization, do \\nnot have an asthma action plan,58 have not received asthma \\neducation,59 and have not been using a holding chamber or \\na spacer device for their inhalers.40,47,56 Moreover, follow-up \\ncare is often delayed.

Over the years, she has had many trips \\nto the emergency room and multiple corticosteroid tapers. \\nShe has been treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) \\nand long-acting bronchodilators, but occasionally stops \\nusing them. She is atopic and is allergic to cats, dogs, sev -\\neral pollens, grass, dust mites, and more, to name a few. She \\nwas recently discharged from the intensive care unit after \\nsuffering from a severe asthma exacerbation, which was \\nbelieved to be triggered by influenza virus H1N1. Her body \\nmass index (BMI) is 30; she has gained weight slowly over \\ntime. Spirometry shows moderate airway obstruction with \\na large bronchodilator response. Her exhaled nitric oxide \\n(NO) is 90 ppb and her IgE level is 316 IU/mL. On previ -\\nous blood counts, her eosinophils were often 10% or less. \\nIn contrast, LB is a 40-year-old white female with asthma \\nthat was diagnosed in her late twenties. She has achieved \\npoor control despite being on high-dose ICSs and a long-\\nacting beta-agonist. She uses the emergency room frequently \\nand her inhaled medications do not give her great relief. Her \\nperipheral eosinophils are not elevated, she is nonatopic, \\nand her total IgE is 80 IU/mL. Her exhaled NO is 24 ppb, \\nand lung function testing only revealed mild airway obstruc -\\ntion with a 12% increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec \\n(FEV1) after bronchodilators. These subjects are both obese \\nasthmatics, yet as this chapter will discuss, the association \\nbetween asthma and obesity may be different in these cases. \\nIt is possible, for example, that, in the first case, obesity \\nis a consequence of the underlying asthma severity; in the second case, being obese could potentially be playing a more \\ncausative role in lack of asthma control and disease severity.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nGiven the continued rise in the average BMI among the gen -\\neral population, it is not surprising that a considerable num -\\nber of subjects with asthma are also overweight or obese. \\nMany studies have shown being overweight or obese is a risk \\nfactor for increased asthma severity, poor asthma control, \\nand lower asthma-related quality of life.1–4 Yet the strength \\nof the obesity/asthma association seems less apparent when \\nconsidering more objective clinical measures (i.e., those not \\ndepending on symptoms), such as bronchial hyperrespon -\\nsiveness (BHR) and biomarkers of airway inflammation.5 To \\nfurther complicate things, obesity can increase the risk of \\nbeing wrongly diagnosed with asthma, particularly among \\npatients presenting in the urgent care setting.6 This bias is \\nnot inconsequential, considering that in one study 30% of \\nsubjects diagnosed with asthma actually did not have it.7 \\nTaken together, this suggests that the obesity/asthma asso -\\nciation is more complex than initially thought. This relation -\\nship is probably comprised by a heterogeneous population \\nof subjects with asthma. For some, obesity mostly acts as \\na respiratory symptoms burden without affecting BHR or \\nairway inflammation, while in more susceptible subjects \\nobesity increases asthma severity by adversely modifying \\nairway function, specific inflammatory/injury pathways, or \\nboth. For others, obesity may even be the result, rather than \\nthe cause, of increased asthma severity.8 Understanding the 23Asthma and Obesity\\nClinical Implications\\nFernando Holguin\\nCONTENTS\\nCase Presentation  ...................................................................................................................................................................... 241\\nIntroduction  ............................................................................................................................................................................... 241\\nObesity, a Heavy Load for the Respiratory System  .................................................................................................................. 242\\nClinical Implications  ................................................................................................................................................................. 242\\nObesity as a Risk Factor for Asthma Control and Severity  .................................................................................................. 242\\nObesity and Response to Medications  ................................................................................................................................. 242\\nObesity and Biomarkers of Airway Inflammation and Oxidative Stress  ............................................................................. 243\\nObesity and Weight Loss in Asthma  .................................................................................................................................... 243\\nIs There an Obese Asthma Phenotype Determined by the Age of Asthma Onset?  .............................................................. 243\\nSummary  ................................................................................................................................................................................... 244\\nKey Practical Points  ............................................................................................................................................................. 244\\nReferences  ................................................................................................................................................................................. 244', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 259}),\n"," Document(page_content='242 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nheterogeneity of this relationship is essential for developing \\nspecific, phenotype-driven, weight-loss and pharmacologic \\ninterventions for asthmatics most susceptible to being obese.\\nThis chapter will review the clinical implications of \\nobesity and asthma; it will briefly discuss potential causal \\npathways linking both conditions, summarize the evidence \\nrelating obesity to asthma severity, and discuss the differen -\\ntial response of obesity to asthma medications. Throughout \\nthis chapter, asthma and obesity will be discussed in gen -\\neral terms; however, the last section will focus on the current \\nunderstanding of the “obese asthma phenotype.”\\nAlthough several epidemiological studies and a recent \\nmeta-analysis have shown that increasing BMI is a risk fac -\\ntor for incident asthma (i.e., new asthma medical diagnosis),9 \\nthis is not the focus of this chapter and will therefore not be \\nincluded in this review.\\nOBESITY, A HEAVY LOAD FOR \\nTHE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM\\nAs adiposity increases, several well-known physiologi -\\ncal changes occur. Restrictive lung physiology is induced \\nby excess adipose deposition around the upper abdomen \\nand chest wall and by diaphragmatic displacement due to \\nincreased abdominal fat. The reductions in fractional resid -\\nual capacity and expiratory reserve volume mean breathing \\noccurs in the less compliant part of the pressure–volume \\ncurve; thus, obese individuals require greater respiratory \\nwork of breathing in order to maintain adequate ventilation \\nlevels.10 Obese patients also have increased airway resistance \\nand closing volume, suggesting small airway closure and \\ndynamic air trapping.10,11 Further, obesity may alter airway \\nmechanics and increase the risk for developing BHR.12,13 \\nAlthough an obesity-mediated increase in BHR has not been \\nshown in all studies,5 this inconsistency may be explained \\nby using arbitrarily determined BHR cutoff levels instead \\nof the area under the curve, and by studies using heteroge -\\nneous asthma phenotypes, some of which may be more or \\nless susceptible to obesity-mediated BHR. Although there is \\nprobably construable heterogeneity across obese subjects, the \\ncombination of these obesity-mediated changes in lung func -\\ntion largely explain why obesity increases dyspnea and poor \\nexercise tolerance.\\nBeyond the increased mechanical load on the respira -\\ntory system, adiposity may affect airway function through \\nchanges in adipokine levels. With increasing BMI, there \\nis a concomitant increase in serum leptin and reduction in \\nserum adiponectin. BMI-related changes in these adipo -\\nkines may potentially be causatively related to obesity and \\nasthma.14 As shown in murine models, leptin and adiponectin \\nrespectively increase or decrease airway inflammation and \\nBHR.15,16 Airway leptin levels are also increased in relation to \\nBMI and are highest among obese asthmatics.17,18 Moreover, \\nairway macrophages from obese asthmatics produced the \\nhighest levels of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis fac -\\ntor-alpha (TNF- α) when treated with leptin.17 These data \\nwould suggest that leptin may play a role in mediating airway inflammatory responses in asthma. In contrast to leptin, \\ngreater levels of adiponectin have been found to be protective \\nin females with asthma, and to be inversely related to exhaled \\nNO in cross-sectional studies.19,20 Further studies are needed \\nto determine whether modifying adipokines leads to clini -\\ncal outcome changes among obese asthmatics. The metabolic \\nsyndrome may potentially be another mechanism linking \\nobesity to asthma. Among school-age children, higher tri -\\nglycerides and acanthosis nigricans (associated with insulin \\nresistance) were associated with higher asthma prevalence \\nrates.21 Interestingly, in adults, hyperglycemia and dyslipid -\\nemia associated with the metabolic syndrome are associated \\nwith steeper loss of lung function over time. There are poten -\\ntial mechanisms linking the metabolic syndrome to asthma; \\ninsulin resistance has been shown to have a mitogenic effect \\non airway smooth muscle cells and to induce a hypercontrac -\\ntile phenotype in these cells.22,23 In addition, leptin has been \\nshown to stimulate inflammatory signaling in human airway \\nepithelial cells.24\\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS\\nobesIty as a rIsK factor  for asthMa \\ncontrol  and sever Ity\\nBeing overweight or obese has been shown in several studies \\nto be a risk factor for increased asthma severity. Compared \\nwith lean asthmatics, obese and overweight asthmatics \\nhave more frequent respiratory symptoms, use rescue ther -\\napies more often, and have poorer asthma-related quality \\nof life and asthma control. Further, obesity is associated \\nwith increased emergency room visits and hospitaliza -\\ntions for asthma exacerbations.3 Yet the severity of asthma \\nexacerbations between obese and nonobese individuals is \\nsimilar.25 This would suggest that, potentially, other fac -\\ntors, such as symptom perception and symptom intensity, \\ncontribute to obesity’s association with greater numbers of \\nemergency room visits. Regardless, there is strong evidence \\nthat changes in body weight influence asthma control, as \\nshown in a longitudinal study of difficult-to-control asthma \\npatients. In this study, patients who gained 5 lb (2.27 kg) \\nduring the 12-month interval between baseline and follow-\\nup reported worse asthma control (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: \\n1.22; 95% CI: 1.01–1.49; P = 0.04) and quality of life (0.18; \\n95% CI: 0.30–0.06; P = 0.003), as well as a greater number \\nof steroid bursts (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.04–1.66; P = 0.02) \\nthan patients who either maintained or lost weight.26\\nobesIty and response  to MedIcatIons\\nPeters-Golden et al. reported, in a retrospective analysis of \\na clinical trial comparing ICS and montelukast versus pla -\\ncebo, that obese asthmatics have reduced responses to ICS \\ntherapy.27 Increasing BMI was inversely associated with \\nachieving adequate asthma control days while adjusting for \\npotential confounders. Interestingly, the inverse associa -\\ntion between asthma control days and BMI was less steep ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 260}),\n"," Document(page_content='243 Asthma and Obesity\\namong subjects randomized to montelukast, which suggests \\nthat leukotriene blockers could potentially be more effective \\namong the obese. However, a subsequent study showed that \\ninhaled fluticasone, regardless of BMI category, was superior \\nto montelukast in improving lung function, symptom scores, \\nand morning peak flow and reducing albuterol use.28 Even \\nwhen adhering to treatment guidelines, having a higher BMI \\naffects the response to therapy. As shown by Saint-Pierre \\net\\xa0al., overweight asthmatics have a significantly lower proba -\\nbility of achieving asthma control when compared with those \\nwith a lower normal BMI.29 Further, in a study of cortico -\\nsteroid-naïve asthmatics randomized to inhaled budesonide \\nor budesonide + salmeterol, obese and overweight asth -\\nmatics had lower odds ratios for achieving asthma control \\nat 12 weeks regardless of the assigned treatment.2 In chil -\\ndren participating in the Childhood Asthma Management \\nProgram (CAMP), those who were overweight or obese had \\nimprovements in FEV1 and bronchodilation in response to \\nbudesonide; however, this was a transient improvement that \\noccurred during the early but not late stages of the trial.30 \\nAlthough it is unclear why obesity may render inhaled ste -\\nroids less effective, there is evidence that it may increase ste -\\nroid resistance. It has been demonstrated that with increasing \\nBMI, the ability of dexamethasone to induce mitogen-acti -\\nvated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1, a key factor for \\nsteroid activity) in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) and \\nbronchoalveolar lavage cells is reduced. Also, the expression \\nof TNF- α in PBMC of asthmatics increased in relation to \\nBMI.31\\nobesIty and bIoMarKers of aIrway \\nInfla MMatIon and oxIdatIve stress\\nIncreasing BMI in asthmatics has either not been associated or, \\nsomewhat paradoxically, has been inversely related to airway \\nbiomarkers of eosinophilic inflammation. Several studies, for \\nexample, have shown that the fractional excretion of exhaled \\nnitric oxide (FeNO) is inversely associated with BMI or that \\nobese asthmatics have lower FeNO when compared with \\nthe leaner weight categories. More recently, it has been sug -\\ngested that among late-onset asthmatics, the inverse associa -\\ntion between FeNO and BMI may be partly determined by the \\nL-arginine and the asymmetric di-methylarginine (ADMA) \\nbalance. ADMA is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide syn -\\nthase (NOS) that can uncouple NOS, reducing NO production \\nwhile generating anion superoxide.32 Among consecutive out -\\npatient asthmatics, sputum eosinophils have not been shown to \\nbe different across the quintile BMI distribution; in contrast, \\namong difficult-to-control asthmatics, increasing BMI has \\nbeen inversely related to sputum eosinophils.20,33–36 In contrast, \\nsome obese asthmatics have been shown to have greater air -\\nway neutrophilia.37 Interestingly, after ingestion of a high-fat \\nmeal, there is an increase in airway neutrophilia in lean and \\nobese asthmatics, which is also associated with reduced bron -\\nchodilation.38 Higher BMI has also been linked to increased \\nlevels of 8-isoprostanes (a nonenzymatic biomarker of lipid \\nperoxidation), higher levels of 4-hydroxynonenal, and reduced airway pH.34,39,40 A greater degree of airway neutrophilia and \\noxidative stress could potentially explain why some obese \\nasthmatics are less ICS responsive.41\\nobesIty and weIght loss In asthMa\\nWeight loss is by all accounts beneficial to patients with \\nasthma. As shown in a meta-analysis, weight loss random -\\nized control studies (using diet, medication, and exercise) can \\nlead to reductions in respiratory symptoms, lower rates of \\nrescue medication use, and modest improvements in FEV1.42 \\nHowever, issues related to small sample size and potential \\nbias limit the interpretation of these results. Two studies have \\nshown that bariatric surgery-induced weight loss improves \\nasthma control, lessens asthma severity, and reduces BHR.43,44 \\nHowever, in a post hoc  analysis, Dixon et al. showed an effect \\nmodification on BHR based on whether subjects had lower \\nor normal versus high IgE. In other words, only among sub -\\njects with low or normal IgE (these patients are usually more \\nlikely to be late-onset asthma with less atopic patients) was \\nweight loss effective in improving BHR. Boulet et al. did not \\nfind that age of asthma onset modified the effect that bariatric \\nsurgery-induced weight loss had on BHR; however, this study \\nwas very small.44 Although it requires further evaluation, the \\nstudy by Dixon et al. suggests that obesity may differentially \\naffect airway function, depending on the underlying asthma \\nclinical phenotype.43\\nIs there an obese asthMa phenotype  \\ndeter MIned by the age of asthMa onset?\\nAsthma that begins later in life is now recognized as more \\ncommonly occurring in women and consisting of mul -\\ntiple different phenotypes, but is often less associated with \\nallergic/T-helper type 2 (Th2) inflammation than early-onset \\ndisease.45,46 While aspirin-sensitive asthma and occupational \\nasthma are considered adult-onset forms, more recent stud -\\nies have suggested that some late-onset asthma is associated \\nwith obesity. These studies suggest that the physiology and \\neven the pathobiology of adult-onset, obese asthma are dif -\\nferent from those of childhood-onset asthma.47 In fact, data \\nfrom cluster analyses of asthma phenotypes studies suggest \\nthat obesity is associated with a cluster, characterized by \\nlate-onset asthma in patients who are primarily obese women \\nwith a high degree of symptoms, despite having relatively \\npreserved lung function or low levels of airway inflamma -\\ntion.45,46 However, the obese-asthma phenotype is not nec -\\nessarily uniform across all obese individuals. Based on the \\ncombined analysis of two studies from the Asthma Clinical \\nResearch Network, there were two clusters with BMI in the \\nobese range: an uncontrolled asthma cluster, characterized by \\nhigher exhaled NO, lower BMI, and a younger age of asthma \\nonset (mean of 10 years); and a second, asthma-controlled \\ncluster, characterized by older age of asthma onset (mean of \\n16.1 years), lower exhaled NO, and lower IgE levels.48 These \\ntwo obese clusters could represent two distinct obese phe -\\nnotypes: an early-onset atopic one with more eosinophilic ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 261}),\n"," Document(page_content='244 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nairway inflammation, and a second, less atopic and of later \\nonset. The difficult question here is to determine in which of \\nthese phenotypes is obesity a factor for asthma severity or a \\nconsequence of increased asthma severity. Although cross-\\nsectional studies cannot fully answer this question, a recent \\nstudy from the Severe Asthma Research program (SARP) \\nshowed that among early-onset asthmatics ( <12 years of \\nage) BMI appears to linearly increase in relation to the dura -\\ntion of asthma; in contrast, there is no association between \\nasthma duration and BMI among later-onset asthmatics.8 \\nThis difference could potentially suggest that in early-onset \\nasthma, increasing BMI may be the consequence of asthma \\n(i.e., respiratory severity, inability to exercise, steroids, etc.), \\nwhereas in the late-onset disease obesity may be a primary \\ndeterminant of the disease, rather than a response to the dis -\\nease or its treatment (see Figure 23.1).\\nSUMMARY\\nThe association between obesity and asthma is highly com -\\nplex and potentially causative at many pathophysiological \\nlevels. Although it seems that obesity universally increases \\nthe respiratory symptoms’ frequency or severity, it may be, in \\na subset of more susceptible patients (i.e., obese asthma phe -\\nnotype), that obesity increases the exacerbation risk through \\nmechanisms such as increased BHR and changes in none -\\nosinophilic airway inflammation and oxidation. Identifying \\nthis asthma phenotype will be critical in developing specific \\ntherapies and public health interventions geared toward those \\nthat stand to benefit the most.\\nKey pract Ical poInts\\n• Obesity is a risk factor for increased respiratory \\nsymptom severity in subjects with asthma.\\n• The asthma phenotype (more susceptible asthmat -\\nics in whom obesity affects mechanisms or air -\\nway inflammation/function) may be characterized \\nby those with late-onset asthma, probably after \\n12\\xa0years of age, that are less atopic and have low \\nexhaled NO. This phenotype may be more frequent \\namong females.• Inhaled steroids (whether this is limited to only \\nthose with the “asthma phenotype” is unclear) may \\nbe less effective in obese asthmatics.\\n• Weight loss improves symptom scores and lung \\nvolumes, yet it appears that obesity-mediated BHR \\nis potentially limited to those with less allergic \\ninflammation.\\nREFERENCES\\n 1.

His symptoms begin within \\n1 h after arriving at work and persist throughout his shift. \\nInitially the symptoms resolved after leaving the workplace, \\nbut over time persisted at home, causing him to wake up \\ntwo to three times a night. His symptoms improve when the \\nplant is closed for holidays and when he is on vacation, but \\nresume immediately after returning to work. He has no his -\\ntory of asthma but has some spring and fall seasonal upper \\nrespiratory symptoms consisting of sneezing, nasal conges -\\ntion, and rhinorrhea. Other than some mild hypertension \\nand hypercholesterolemia controlled with diet, he is healthy. \\nHis work process involves operating a forklift in a warehouse \\nwhere finished powdered chemicals in one-ton plastic bales \\nare stored. He wears no personal protective equipment such \\nas a respirator. His physical exam reveals some mild inspi -\\nratory wheezing but is otherwise normal. His peak expira -\\ntory flow (PEF) is 350, which is decreased for his age and \\nheight (normal for 72-inch male: 632 L/min). Spirometry \\nreveals an FEV1 of 2.4 L (60% predicted), which improves \\nto 4 L (100% predicted) after bronchodilators. Exhaled \\nnitric oxide level is 72 ppb (normal <20 ppb). The worker \\nis provided with a PEF meter and diary and asked to record \\nPEF every 2 h while in the workplace and every 3–4 h at \\nhome while awake. He is given an albuterol inhaler to use \\nas needed for chest tightness and wheezing. He also is asked \\nto obtain material safety data sheets (MSDSs) for review. During\\xa0his\\xa0return\\xa0visit 2 weeks later he is still very symptom -\\natic. His PEF is 30% lower at work than at home. MSDSs \\nreveal he is exposed to trimellitic anhydride (TMA), phthalic \\nanhydride (PA), and maleic anhydride (MA) powders. Blood \\nis obtained for specific IgE and IgG to TMA, PA, and MA \\nfrom a commercial laboratory. He is started on an inhaled \\ncorticosteroid and instructed not to go into the warehouse. \\nAfter discussion with the company safety supervisor, the \\nworker is able to be placed in an area of the plant where there \\nis no chemical exposure. A return visit 4 weeks later reveals \\nthat the worker is symptomatically much improved and his \\nPEF has increased to 560 L/min; his FEV1 has improved to \\n3.7 L and his exhaled nitric oxide has decreased to 20 ppb. \\nResults of his blood testing reveal increased specific IgE and \\nIgG to TMA only. The worker is instructed to continue to \\navoid exposure to TMA and continue his inhaled corticoste -\\nroid as prescribed. A return visit 8 weeks later reveals he is \\ncompletely asymptomatic and his FEV1 has increased to 4 L.\\nDiagnosis:  TMA-induced occupational asthma.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nOccupational asthma (OA) is defined as “a disease charac -\\nterized by variable airflow limitation and/or hyperrespon -\\nsiveness and/or inflammation due to causes and conditions \\nattributable to a particular occupational environment and \\nnot to stimuli encountered outside the workplace”.1 OA clas -\\nsically is characterized by a latency period during which \\ntime workers are exposed to either a high-molecular-weight \\n(HMW) or low-molecular-weight (LMW) agent for a varying 24Occupational Asthma\\nJonathan A.

Differences \\nin incidence are mainly due to methodological differences \\nin calculating incidence and the types of occupations and \\nemployment opportunities in each country.6 The Sentinel \\nEvent Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) \\nwas first developed in several U.S. states in the 1980s to \\nencourage reporting of OA cases by physicians and to put \\nthem in contact with public health agencies responsible for \\ninvestigating high-risk workplaces.7 This program was suc -\\ncessful at increasing awareness among physicians about OA, \\nbut underreporting of cases has been a continuous problem.7 \\nOther countries have developed voluntary reporting regis -\\ntries to identify the ongoing incidence and prevalence of OA \\nwith varying degrees of success.8–12 The evaluation of asthma \\ncases being considered for workers’ compensation or disabil -\\nity benefits has been another source of estimated incidence \\nrates of OA.\\nIt is estimated that up to 15% of all new diagnoses of \\nasthma begin in the workplace. More than 300 agents in \\nthe workplace have now been associated with causing OA.13 \\nCross-sectional studies have provided prevalence data for \\na number of agents known to cause OA. Prevalence of OA \\nvaries widely between occupations. Studies have found \\nthe prevalence of OA for laboratory animal workers to be \\napproximately 20%, for western red cedar-induced OA \\napproximately 5%, for baker’s asthma 7%–9%, for isocyanate-\\ninduced OA 5%–21%, platinum-exposed workers 20%–50%, \\nand enzyme-exposed workers to be as high as 60%.6,14–16 The \\nprevalence of OA within a specific occupation depends on \\nenvironmental conditions within the plant, exposure levels, durations of exposure, and the effectiveness of procedures \\nimplemented in the workplace to reduce worker exposure.6 \\nUsing cross-sectional studies to determine OA prevalence \\ncan result in an underestimation due to the “healthy worker \\neffect,” which refers to the occurrence of symptomatic work -\\ners leaving the workplace without documenting the work \\nrelatedness of their illness, leading to what appears to be a \\nhealthier workforce.17 To obtain more accurate prevalence \\ndata information about the causes, risk factors, and natu -\\nral course of OA, surveillance programs for some high-risk \\nmanufacturing industries have been established in developed \\ncountries, including the United Kingdom, United States, and \\nFinland. The Surveillance of Work-Related and Occupational \\nRespiratory Disease (SWORD) program established in the \\nUnited Kingdom involves voluntary reporting of occupa -\\ntional illnesses from a variety of industries by pulmonolo -\\ngists and occupational medicine physicians.18 This program \\nhas been very useful for generating prevalence data due to \\nthe excellent response rate from participating physicians. The \\nSWORD database has found that OA is the most frequently \\nreported occupational respiratory illness and that isocyanates \\nare the most common specific cause of OA.18 As mentioned, \\nthe SENSOR program established in the United States has \\nnot been as successful in obtaining useful epidemiologic data \\ndue to a poor response rate from participating physicians.7 \\nIn contrast, the Finnish program has been successful over \\na relatively short period in estimating the country’s yearly \\nincidence of OA and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.8\\nIMMUNOPATHOGENESIS\\nThe pathogenic features of OA are similar to those observed in \\nnon-OA patients. In general, lung biopsies of patients with OA \\ndemonstrate increased numbers of inflammatory cells with \\na predominance of eosinophils and lymphocytes, increased \\nintercellular spaces between epithelial cells, and thickening of \\nthe reticular basement membrane due to deposition of types I, \\nIII, and V collagen.19 It has been demonstrated that the degree \\nof reticular basement membrane thickening differs between \\ndifferent forms of OA. For example, workers with RADS have \\nbeen demonstrated to have basement membrane thickening \\nas great as 30–40 μm compared with workers with diisocya -\\nnate-induced OA (6–15 μm) and normal subjects (3–8 μm).20 \\nSimilar bioactive mediators and proinflammatory cytokines \\noccur in OA and non-OA.19 Interestingly, agents including \\nnatural rubber latex, mushroom spores, acrylates, and epoxy \\nresins can cause work-related lower respiratory symptoms that \\nmanifest as eosinophilic bronchitis, characterized as a chronic \\ncough with sputum eosinophilia, in the absence of bronchial \\nAHR.21 Although less common, OA can manifest as neutro -\\nphilic inflammation with some LMW agents.22 For non-OA, \\nthe presence of neutrophils is believed to be a marker of sever -\\nity, but their role in different causes of OA is still unclear.23 \\nPatients with OA and non-OA can exhibit similar inflamma -\\ntory/physiologic phases of asthma.24 However, different causes \\nof OA characteristically exhibit different airway responses. \\nFor example, whereas an early airway response (EAR) is ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 266}),\n"," Document(page_content='249 Occupational Asthma\\nmore characteristic of HMW agents, the late airway response \\n(LAR) and dual airway response (DAR) are more commonly \\nobserved in workers with isocyanate-induced OA.24 It is pos -\\nsible to miss a diagnosis of isocyanate-induced OA as workers \\nwho exhibit a LAR may not manifest clinical symptoms until \\nleaving the workplace.24\\nMECHANISMS\\nHMW and LMW agents known to cause OA involve \\nT-helper type 2 (Th2) proinflammatory cytokines charac -\\nteristic of IgE-mediated allergic asthma.19 Enzymes are a \\ngood example of HMW agents whereas acid anhydrides \\nare a good example of LMW agents known to cause OA \\nthrough an IgE-mediated mechanism. In contrast to HMW \\nagents, most LMW chemicals (plicatic acid and diisocya -\\nnates) cause OA through as of yet unknown non-IgE-medi -\\nated mechanisms. Several mechanisms have been proposed \\nfor different clinical presentations associated with a num -\\nber of causative agents.19 For acid anhydrides, specific IgE, \\ncytotoxic, immune complex, and cell-mediated immune \\nresponses have all been reported (Table 24.1).25,26 The \\nmechanism(s) for irritant-induced asthma or RADS caused \\nby a single high exposure or chronic low exposure to a \\nchemical (i.e., anhydrous ammonia) also remains elusive.4 \\nIt is speculated that chronic inflammatory changes occur in \\nthese workers as a result of toxic injury to bronchial epithe -\\nlial cells leading to loss of epithelial-derived relaxing fac -\\ntors combined with neurogenic inflammation and release \\nof bioactive mediators and proinflammatory cytokines by nonspecific activation of mast cells.4 A number of OA ani -\\nmal models have been developed in an attempt to better elu -\\ncidate the role of innate and adaptive immune responses \\nin causing a variety of IgE and non-IgE-mediated induced \\nOA.27–29\\nGENETICS\\nGenetic associations in workers with OA have been reported. \\nFor example, workers who develop acid anhydride OA \\nexpress the class II HLA molecule DQB1*501.30 Interestingly, \\nthis genetic marker may be protective against developing OA \\nsecondary to isocyanates or plicatic acid.31,32 In laboratory \\nanimal handlers, the HLADRB1*07 phenotype was more \\ncommonly expressed in workers sensitized to rat lipocalin \\nallergens.33 Glutathione-S transferase (GST) polymorphisms, \\nassociated with reduction in oxidative stress, have been \\nreported to protect isocyanate-exposed workers from devel -\\noping asthma in a way similar to what has been observed \\nwith non-OA induced by ozone and diesel exhaust particu -\\nlate exposures.34 Subsequently, GST, microsomal epoxide \\nhydrolase, and manganese superoxide dismutase have been \\ndemonstrated to be associated with diisocyanate OA.35 More \\nrecently, polymorphisms of α-catenin gene (CTNNA3), a \\nkey protein of the adherence junctional complex on epithe -\\nlial cells important for cell adherence, have been found to \\nbe associated with diisocyanate OA.36 In addition, previ -\\nous studies have found that N-acetyltransferase genotypes, \\nspecifically the slow acetylator genotype, increased the risk \\nof isocyanate-exposed workers for developing OA almost \\nTABLE 24.1\\nTrimellitic Acid Anhydride Clinical Syndromes\\nCharacteristics Rhinitis/Asthma Late AsthmaLate Respiratory \\nSystemic Syndrome \\n(LRSS) aka TMA FluPulmonary \\nDisease-AnemiaIrritant-Induced \\nAsthma\\nLatency period Yes Yes Yes Yes No\\nOnset of symptoms \\nafter work exposureImmediate (30–60 min) 4–12 h 4–12 h Progressive with further \\nwork exposureVariable depending on \\nexposure\\nClinical symptoms Cough, wheeze, chest \\ntightness, shortness of \\nbreath, rhinorrhea, \\nnasal congestion, \\nsneezing, postnasal \\ndrainageCoughing, sneezing, \\ntightness in chest, \\nwheezing due to \\nconstriction of \\nairways, sneezing, \\nitching of noseResembles hypersensitivity \\npneumonitis.

A comprehensive review \\nof old and new causes of OA has recently been published.13\\nThe classic presentation of a worker with OA con -\\nsists of symptoms that begin while at work and resolve \\nor improve either shortly after leaving the workplace at \\nnight, during weekends, or while on vacation.41 However, \\na worker with OA may not improve away from the work -\\nplace because of chronic airway inflammation with or \\nwithout fixed obstruction of the airways as a result of per -\\nsistent workplace exposure to an agent for months or years \\nafter the initial onset of symptoms.41 In addition, patients \\nwith RADS typically do not improve away from work.4 \\nTherefore, the diagnosis of OA should not be overlooked \\nbecause of the apparent lack of correlation of symptoms \\nwith workplace exposure.\\nOmission or an inadequate history pertaining to the work -\\nplace can often delay the diagnosis of OA for months or years. Figure 24.1 is an algorithmic approach for the evaluation and \\ndiagnosis of OA.42 Structured occupational questionnaires \\nhave been developed as tools for determining the probability of \\nOA.40 The basic components of a structured occupational ques -\\ntionnaire include an employment history and medical history \\n(Table  24.3).40 The employment history should ascertain the \\nfollowing information: the worker’s past and present employ -\\nment history; their work process, including all jobs that could be \\nrelated to specific exposures; work processes in adjacent areas; \\nwork-shift hours; previous jobs where the worker may have been \\nexposed to similar or identical agents; relationship of symptoms \\nexperienced before, during, or after work to a specific exposure \\nin the workplace; duration of symptoms after leaving the work -\\nplace; improvement of symptoms on weekends or vacations; \\nassociated upper respiratory and dermatologic symptoms; sys -\\ntemic symptoms such as fever, chills, and temperature; smoking \\nhistory; preexisting allergy/asthma history; previous chemical \\nspill exposure; and potential risk factors for OA.40 Although \\noccupational questionnaires are helpful in ascertaining invalu -\\nable information that determines the likelihood of workplace-\\nrelated asthma, history alone is sensitive but not specific and \\ntherefore cannot be relied upon to make a definitive diagnosis of \\nOA without confirmatory objective testing.\\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) are an essential com -\\nponent of the occupational history.43 They provide invaluable \\ninformation regarding generic chemical names and specific \\nconstituents of raw materials being used in the workplace. \\nThey also provide standard information about threshold \\nlimit values (TLV) and permissible exposure levels (PEL) of \\npotentially toxic and/or sensitizing agents.43 When available, \\nTABLE 24.2\\nCriteria for Defining OA Proposed by the American College of Chest \\nPhysicians\\n A.

At times, OA must also \\nbe distinguished from other diseases, such as vocal cord dys -\\nfunction, chronic obstructive lung disease, pneumoconiosis, \\nbronchiolitis obliterans, and endotoxin-induced asthma-like \\nsyndromes such as grain fever or byssinosis.40 These disor -\\nders are differentiated from OA by history, chest radiograph, chest computerized tomography (CT) scan, lung volumes with \\ndiffusion capacity, and, if necessary, open lung biopsy.

Studies comparing IgE serum-specific assays \\nwith skin prick testing have found fairly good correlations \\nfor some LMW agents like TMA.44 Similarly, specific IgE \\nassays and skin test reagents for natural rubber latex and cat \\nand dog allergens have been found to have high positive and \\nnegative predictive values for occupational sensitization.40\\nMeasurement of specific IgG antibodies by ELISA is \\noften performed as part of immunosurveillance programs \\nin industries where workers are exposed to agents known to \\ncause OA. The significance of elevated specific IgG antibod -\\nies to a workplace allergen is less clear but for some agents \\nsuch as isocyanates and acid anhydrides there is evidence to \\nsuggest it could represent a biologic marker of exposure.44,45\\nThe proper interpretation of an immunologic test used in \\nthe diagnosis of OA requires validation against an accepted \\nbenchmark, such as the specific bronchoprovocation test \\n(SBPT). In addition, proper standardization of an immuno -\\nassay always requires the use of well-established positive \\nand negative control sera.40 Other in vitro  assays that have \\nbeen proposed as biomarkers for OA include monocyte \\nchemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), lymphocyte prolifera -\\ntion, and leukocyte histamine release, which have been used \\nprimarily as research tools in the investigation of workers \\nwith OA induced by various agents.40,46 Skin test responses \\nand in vitro  specific antibody responses may decline within \\nmonths or years after removal from exposure to the causative \\nagent, which may limit their clinical utility in the evalua -\\ntion of workers remotely exposed to an incriminated agent. \\nTable 24.4 summarizes a representative number of HMW \\nand LMW causes of OA and immunologic tests used for \\ndiagnosis.13,40\\nphysIolog Ic assess Ment\\nMany approaches have been used in measuring lung func -\\ntion in workers suspected of OA. It is recommended that \\nlung function be monitored in the workplace during a known \\nexposure to a suspected causative agent. However, this is \\nnot always logistically possible. Personnel experienced in \\nproper performance of pulmonary function testing may not \\nbe readily available to conduct serial testing of lung function \\nand employers may not be cooperative. Spirometry should \\ninclude the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced \\nvital capacity (FVC), and the maximum mid-expiratory flow \\nrate (FEF25–75).40 Assessment of cross-shift lung function \\n(i.e., pre- and post-shift FEV1) has been used to correlate \\nasthma symptoms to workplace exposure, but this approach \\nlacks sensitivity for confirming OA.40 Multiple assessments \\nof PEF at work (4–5 times per day) often capture enough \\ndata to diagnose or exclude OA.40 Furthermore, cross-shift \\nchanges in a worker’s lung function have been found to be \\ndirectly proportional to their level of exposure to the sensi -\\ntizing agent. Serial measurements of PEF, when performed \\nproperly, correlate moderately well with results of the SBPT \\nused in the diagnosis of OA.40 Serial PEF measurements should be interpreted with caution due to patient noncom -\\npliance and the potential for falsification of measurements. \\nUsing computerized peak flow meters that record effort \\nassociated with each measurement, reproducibility, and the \\nexact time of the reading may circumvent these problems.40 \\nAlthough not diagnostic, nonspecific bronchial hyperrespon -\\nsiveness (NSBH) testing with agonists such as methacho -\\nline, histamine, and mannitol is essential for confirming the \\npresence or absence of AHR, a central feature of asthma. \\nSubjects with a positive methacholine test and evidence of \\nspecific IgE to a HMW are more likely to exhibit a positive \\nSBPT to that agent. Negative tests of NSBH are most useful \\nin excluding a current diagnosis of OA in a currently symp -\\ntomatic exposed worker.40\\nThe SBPT is considered the gold standard for diagnosis \\nof OA. This test should only be administered in specially \\nequipped centers under the supervision of physicians expe -\\nrienced in conducting this procedure.40 Specific provocation \\ntesting is very time consuming and expensive to perform and \\ntherefore not readily available. However, if performed prop -\\nerly, the SBPT can be performed with minimal risk. Several \\nairway response patterns may be elicited that are character -\\nistic for workers presenting with OA.40 An isolated EAR is \\ncharacterized by the immediate onset of asthma symptoms \\nafter exposure to an agent that is more commonly associated \\nwith IgE-mediated OA. An isolated LAR, which occurs until \\n4–12 h after exposure to the challenge agent, is more charac -\\nteristic of nonimmunologic OA induced by LMW chemical \\nagents.40 Finally, workers with OA may exhibit a DAR char -\\nacterized by an EAR followed by a recovery period and then \\nan LAR. Multiple physiologic patterns have been observed in \\nOA caused by chemicals. For example, workers with diisocy -\\nanate-induced OA present 30%–50% of the time with DARs, \\n40% of the time with an isolated LAR, and <10% of the time \\nwith an isolated EAR.24,40\\nAsthma occurring in the workplace in the absence of a \\nlatency period is characteristic of RADS, also referred to as \\nirritant-induced OA.4 RADS typically occurs after one or \\nmore repetitive large inhalational exposure to a toxic chemi -\\ncal agent such as ammonia gas, acidic fumes, smoke, or \\nspray paints.4 RADS must be differentiated from the irritant \\nsymptoms that occur in patients with preexisting asthma. \\nIrritant symptoms disappear promptly after cessation of \\nexposure and are not associated with prolonged bronchocon -\\nstriction or bronchial hyperresponsiveness characteristic of \\nRADS.4 Workers with RADS typically do not manifest air -\\nway response patterns seen with OA induced by HMW and \\nLMW agents.\\nCLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF A PATIENT \\nWITH OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA\\nAs in the case summary presented in this chapter, the first \\nstep for assessing a suspected case of OA is to obtain a care -\\nful physician-administered history.40,42 This can be greatly \\nenhanced by using a validated occupational questionnaire \\nto capture the necessary clinical and exposure information ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 271}),\n"," Document(page_content='254 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nTABLE 24.4\\nEtiologic Agents of HMW and LMW OA and Reported Immunologic Tests\\nAgent In Vivo In Vitro\\nAzodicarbonamide Prick tests with 0.1%, 1%, and 5% azodicarbonamide Not done\\nBaby’s breath Intradermal titration testing RAST/histamine release\\nBacillus subtilis  enzymes Prick tests with 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 10 mg/mL RAST/radial immunodiffusion\\nBuckwheat flour Prick test with 10 mg/mL Reverse enzyme immunoassay/histamine release\\nCarmine dye Skin test with Coccus cactus RAST to dyes\\nCastor bean Prick test with 1:100 extract Not done\\nChloramine-T, halazone Scratch test at 10−5 dilution Not done\\nChromate Prick test at 10, 5, 1, and 0.1 mg/mL Cr2(SO4)3 RAST to HSA-chromium sulfate\\nCobalt Patch tests RAST to HSA-cobalt sulfate\\nCoffee bean Intradermal titration to coffee bean extract RAST to coffee bean extract\\nDiazonium tetrafluoroborate (DTFB) Not done RAST to HSA-DTFB\\nDimethylethanolamine Prick tests to dimethylethanolamine undiluted at 1:10, 1:100, \\nand 1:1000Not done\\nDouglas fir tussock moth Cutaneous tests with 1:25 extract Histamine release\\nDyes, textiles Prick or scratch tests to dyes at 10 mg/mL in 50% glycerine HSA-dye\\nEgg proteins Prick tests with 1:10 w/v egg white, egg yolk, whole egg;

A negative \\nmethacholine test (PC20 >10 mg/mL) excludes AHR and is \\na good negative predictor for asthma. A positive methacho -\\nline test indicates the presence of AHR suggestive of asthma \\nbut is nonspecific and does not confirm a diagnosis of OA. \\nIn this case, assessment of lung function performed at and \\naway from the workplace to demonstrate AHR around the \\nsuspected agent is very useful for supporting a diagnosis of \\nOA.42 When possible, a workplace challenge, which consists \\nof supervised measurements of lung function (i.e., FEV1) in \\nthe actual work site before and during work shifts for at least \\n1 week of work exposure, should be conducted. Improvement \\nof symptoms and lung function after removal from the work -\\nplace with subsequent deterioration after reintroduction into \\nthe workplace further supports a diagnosis of OA, except in \\nthe case of RADS.42 If a workplace challenge cannot be per -\\nformed, PEF monitoring should be conducted over 2–3 weeks \\nat work.42 The worker should measure and record his or her \\nPEF every 2 h at work and every 3–4 h while awake at home \\nor at least four times a day. Work exposure, symptoms, and \\nmedication usage should be recorded in a diary during this \\ntime. Diurnal variability of >20% at work as compared with \\nnormal variability at home is consistent with OA.40,42 The \\ngold standard for the diagnosis of OA is the SBPT.40,42 If a \\nspecific substance in the workplace is suspected of causing \\nOA and the workplace challenge is equivocal, a SBPT may \\nbe necessary.40,42 The PC20 ascertained by methacholine or \\nhistamine testing may be helpful for estimating the initial \\ndose of an occupational agent prior to the specific inhalation \\nchallenge test. An SBPT should not be performed in workers \\nwith severe cardiac or pulmonary disease (FEV1 <60%).40,42 \\nSpecific inhalation challenge tests have also been used to doc -\\nument causation of OA by new substances in index cases and \\nfor medical/legal purposes in proving or excluding a worker’s \\neligibility for workers’ compensation. Although specific chal -\\nlenge tests confirm a diagnosis of OA if positive, negative \\ntests do not always exclude the diagnosis in workers who have \\nbeen removed from the workplace for a period of time, dur -\\ning which bronchial AHR to the suspected agent may have \\nresolved. It is therefore important to perform a SBPT either \\nbefore or shortly after removing the worker from his or her \\nworkplace. Other potential problems with specific inhalation \\nchallenge testing are poor standardization of methods used \\namong different centers and inability to reproduce workplace \\nexposure conditions in the laboratory including temperature, \\natmospheric pressure, and concentration.40,42 As with any specific inhalation challenge, false positive and false negative \\ntests can occur and therefore results must be interpreted with \\ncaution.42 In addition to lung function assessment, it is impor -\\ntant to identify the worker’s allergic status by skin testing to \\ncommon seasonal and perennial aeroallergens, especially for \\nworkers exposed to HMW agents. Skin prick testing to the \\nsuspected causative agent and/or specific IgE in vitro  assays \\ncan also be performed when appropriate.40,42\\nTREATMENT\\nOnce the diagnosis of OA has been confirmed, the treatment \\nof choice is to remove the worker from further exposure.42 \\nStudies evaluating the clinical course of workers after removal \\nfrom the workplace have found that persistence of their \\nasthma was correlated with the duration of exposure and \\nsymptoms prior to diagnosis. Individuals with OA caused \\nby diisocyanates or western red cedar wood dust had a bet -\\nter prognosis if they were diagnosed early, had relatively \\nwell-preserved lung function, and less AHR compared with \\nsymptomatic workers who remained in the workplace for \\nlonger periods of time and had greater deterioration of lung \\nfunction, leading to chronic persistent asthma requiring \\nincreased medication use even after being removed from \\nexposure. Use of respirators and other personal protective \\nequipment (PPE) should be enforced for workers exposed \\nto known causes of OA such as enzymes, isocyanates, and \\nacid anhydrides. However, once OA has been established, \\nuse of PPE does not always prevent or reduce exposure \\nor prevent clinical deterioration.48 Some studies have sug -\\ngested that certain types of respirators such as airstream \\nhelmets may offer adequate protection for the worker from \\nthe offending agent; however, they are generally not con -\\nsidered adequate substitutes for absolute avoidance mea -\\nsures.49 Pharmacologic treatment of acute or chronic OA \\nis similar to that of non-OA, which involves inhaled cor -\\nticosteroids, with or without long acting beta2-adrenergic \\nagonists, leukotriene-modifying agents, xanthine oxidase \\ninhibitors like theophylline, and, for severe asthma exac -\\nerbations, oral corticosteroids.48,49 Medications can be used \\nin various combinations depending on the severity of the \\nworker’s symptoms. Immunotherapy may play a role in the \\ntreatment of some forms of OA caused by HMW protein \\nallergens such as laboratory animal proteins.49\\nPREVENTION AND IMMUNOSURVEILLANCE\\nThe primary categories of prevention include reducing expo -\\nsure to known occupational inciting agents, identifying sus -\\nceptible workers and removing them from exposure, and \\nadministering workplace controls to reduce the number of \\nworkers exposed and the duration of their exposure.\\nIt is important to educate at-risk atopic individuals about \\navoidance of occupations where the likelihood for devel -\\noping OA is increased (e.g., laboratory handlers).40,42,48,49 \\nEffective prevention of OA requires cooperation between \\nmanagement and workers in the implementation of good ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 273}),\n"," Document(page_content='256 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nindustrial measures aimed at preventing exposure to agents \\nknown to cause OA.

Perhaps, most importantly, using medications \\nfor prevention of serious exacerbations of asthma and ongoing \\ninadequately controlled asthma are advocated as compared \\nwith minimizing pharmacotherapy.\\nphysIology  dur Ing pregnancy  and effects  \\nof an acute exacerbat Ion of asthMa\\nPregnancy is associated with alterations in maternal physi -\\nology that are impacted by inadequate control of asthma. \\nWhen there is poorly controlled or uncontrolled asthma that \\nresults in maternal hypoxemia or hypoxia, the fetus also \\ncan be stressed when the low-oxygen intrauterine environ -\\nment becomes compromised. Oxygen delivery to the fetus is \\ndependent on maternal cardiac output to generate adequate \\nblood flow to the uterus, an effectively functioning placenta, \\nand sufficient maternal arterial oxygen content.18 Because of \\nthe increase in heart rate and stroke volume and decreased \\nvascular resistance, maternal cardiac output increases some \\n25% over prepregnant levels by 6 weeks of gestation and \\nincreases by 30%–60% as pregnancy progresses.19,20 These \\nchanges result in greater preload and less afterload. The uter -\\nine blood flow increases as much as eightfold from about \\n50 mL/min to 400 mL/min by 20 weeks and remains at that \\nlevel to term.21 A pregnant woman’s blood volume expands \\nby 1200–1600 mL,20 and total body water increases by \\napproximately 5 L.22 There is an increase of red cell mass \\nby 17%–40% without any change in red cell life.20 The \\nexpansion of plasma volume is greater than the increase in \\nred cell mass, which results in the “physiologic anemia of \\npregnancy.” The maternal hemoglobin concentration may be \\n11–12 g/dL. However, the increase in red cell mass helps in \\ndelivery of oxygen to the fetus.\\nThe fetus grows in a low oxygen tension environment. The \\nfetal hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve is shifted to the \\nleft, meaning that it is steeper when compared with that of a \\nnonpregnant, adult woman. The fetal hemoglobin concentra -\\ntion is 16.5 g/L, and fetal hemoglobin is 50% saturated at a \\npO2 of 22 mmHg compared with 26–28 mm/Hg for maternal \\nhemoglobin. Any major reduction in maternal arterial oxy -\\ngen tension has the potential for immediate harm (potentially \\nwithin a few minutes). Alternatively, when there are increases \\nin the maternal arterial oxygen tension, the leftward shift \\nof the fetal hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve results in \\nsharper increases in fetal oxygen saturation than in the moth -\\ner’s arterial blood. There is an expected respiratory alkalosis \\nduring pregnancy resulting in a shift of the maternal hemoglo -\\nbin oxygen dissociation curve to the left, which does not favor \\nunloading of oxygen from hemoglobin at the time of need. \\nWhen the pregnant woman experiences an exacerbation of \\nasthma resulting in hyperventilation, the maternal respiratory \\nalkalosis could worsen the oxygen delivery to the fetus com -\\nbined with ventilation–perfusion abnormalities that reduce \\nthe maternal oxygen tension. Thus, during the acute exac -\\nerbation of asthma producing hyperventilation (and reduced \\nvenous return) with the expected respiratory alkalosis in pregnancy, maternal oxygen tension can decrease, and there \\nis a shift in the maternal hemoglobin oxygen dissociation \\ncurve to the left. When the pregnant woman inspires higher \\nconcentrations of oxygen, the increase in her arterial oxygen \\ntension can be expected (in most cases depending on severity \\nof attack and any concurrent conditions such as pneumonia), \\nbut the increase in oxygen tension in the uterine veins is mod -\\nest, consistent with a large maternal-uterine shunt. Should the \\nacute exacerbation of asthma result in “normal” range pCO2 \\nand pH, this stage of asthma is especially dangerous for the \\nmother as she could be developing acute respiratory acidosis \\nwith a continued rise in pCO2. Intubation and controlled ven -\\ntilation may be indicated as a life-saving measure. There is \\nthe possibility of stillbirth or fetal demise.\\nlessons  learned  froM pregnanc Ies \\noccurr Ing at hIgh altItudes\\nWomen living at high altitudes in Colorado (>8000 ft, 2500 m) \\ndeliver lighter-weight babies; they are reported to be 121 g \\nlighter for 1000 m of elevation. This is thought to be related \\nto slower fetal growth and not a shortened period of gesta -\\ntion.23,24 When women were studied in La Paz (elevation \\n11,880 ft, 3600 m) and El Alto, Bolivia (elevation 14,470 ft, \\n4082 m), comparisons were made between Andean women \\nwho were born and reared at high altitudes and European \\nwomen who had lived in the mountains for an average of \\n4 years.24 During pregnancy, there were increases in resting \\nventilation and arterial oxygen saturation (from 91% to 94%), \\nhelping to offset the reduction in hemoglobin concentration \\nof pregnancy. In comparison, although pregnant women liv -\\ning at sea level also increase their resting ventilation dur -\\ning pregnancy and PaO2, there is no significant increase in \\nmaternal oxygen saturation as the PaO2 is already close to \\nmaximal tension. Indeed, some pregnant women at sea level \\nhave resting PaO2 > 100 mmHg.25 The maternal arterial oxy -\\ngen content can decrease at sea level because of the physi -\\nologic anemia of pregnancy. In contrast, at high altitudes, the \\nincrease in oxygen saturation is thought to maintain and pro -\\ntect the maternal arterial oxygen content, and this occurred \\nin women of both Andean and European backgrounds. The \\nuteroplacental circulation of Andean women appears to have \\nadapted over time to achieve higher flow rates and for various \\nreasons Andean women delivered babies on average 209 g \\nheavier than babies born to European women.24 If a woman \\nliving at sea level has significant hypoxemia from poorly con -\\ntrolled asthma, the compensatory mechanisms may be insuf -\\nficient to avoid hypoxic harm in the fetus.

During acute smooth \\nmuscle contraction of the bronchi in asthma, the pregnant \\nwoman needs to generate increased intrathoracic pressure \\nto apply radial traction on the bronchi as a compensatory \\nprocess to support patency of the airways. Minute ventila -\\ntion does increase as much as 50% by late pregnancy.18 The \\nincreased concentrations of estrogen and especially proges -\\nterone favor the increased ventilation and respiratory alka -\\nlosis. At the same time, oxygen consumption increases. The \\ncarotid body becomes more sensitive to reductions in oxygen, \\nand these respiratory changes occur well before significant \\nenlargement of the uterus. Most studies have found no impor -\\ntant changes in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine; in \\none study there was doubling of the PC20, but the changes \\nwere from 0.35 mg/mL at baseline to 0.72 mg/mL during \\npregnancy.26\\n“Dyspnea” of pregnancy is not from airway obstruction \\nbut rather from progesterone-induced hyperventilation caus -\\ning increased tidal volume in the first and second trimes -\\nters.27 In later pregnancy, “dyspnea” also can be from the \\nenlarging uterus.27\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe incidence of asthma during pregnancy ranges from 8.4% \\nto 13.9%7,11,13,16,28 and the trend has been increasing just as \\nthe prevalence of asthma in the general population has been \\nincreasing (now being 25 million in the United States or 8.3% \\nof the population).29 The questions raised focus on the impact \\nthat pregnancy has on the severity of asthma, the safety (and \\nnecessity) for pharmacotherapy, what dietary changes during \\npregnancy should be incorporated to prevent or reduce the \\nlikelihood of asthma developing in the baby (or over time), \\nto what extent breast-feeding and/or allergen immunother -\\napy will prevent/delay asthma or allergic disorders such as \\neczema or allergic rhinitis, and whether influenza immuniza -\\ntion is necessary.\\neffect of pregnancy  on course  of asthMa\\nThe patient presented has persistent asthma requiring com -\\nbination therapy; thus, she is at risk of worsening asthma as \\ncompared with the “prototype” pregnant woman with per -\\nsistent asthma who is managed with an ICS as controller \\ntherapy. From a case-control series where nurse-interviewers \\nspoke with women at 12 and 18 weeks of gestation and by \\n6 months postpartum, who did not have pulmonary function \\ndata but did record medications, 53% of women reported no \\nchange in symptoms during the pregnancy.16 This average \\nranged from 69% in “well-controlled” to 41% in “poorly con -\\ntrolled” patients.16 Of the 47% of pregnant women who had \\nchanges in their symptoms, about half of this group (24.6%) \\nimproved and the other half (22.4%) reported worsening. It is \\nuseful to know that if a pregnant woman reported being “well controlled,” she was likely to remain so, because just 16.7% \\nof “well-controlled” women reported improving. In the preg -\\nnant women who were “poorly controlled,” some 34.9% \\nreported improving.16 A target for system-wide improvement \\nis why this percent was not greater. The authors noted that \\n63.3% of pregnant women whose asthma was “poorly con -\\ntrolled” did not use a controller medication, implying failure \\nto receive evidence-based recommended pharmacotherapy.16 \\nWorsening of asthma was divided evenly over the three tri -\\nmesters, whereas in those pregnant women who reported \\nimprovement in their asthma this change occurred more \\nlikely in the first (11.8%) than in the second (8.3%) or third \\n(4.5%) trimester.16 Based on pregnancies occurring from 1998 \\nto 2006 in Massachusetts, this study presents opportunities \\nfor improvement in care of pregnant women with asthma. \\nIn another prospective study, where pregnant women were \\nenrolled by 24 weeks of gestation (mean 15 weeks) and in \\nwhich they were interviewed by research assistants in person \\nin their places of residence and then by phone at weeks 20, \\n28, and 36 weeks gestation and in the hospital postpartum, \\nseverity of asthma (intermittent, persistent mild, moderate, \\nor severe) and medications were assessed according to the \\nGINA guidelines.30 More women had intermittent asthma \\n(57.5%) than persistent mild asthma (20.1%) and persistent \\nmoderate or severe asthma (22.5%).30 Women with persis -\\ntent asthma (mild or moderate/severe) were more likely to \\ndevelop severe asthma during pregnancy compared with \\nwomen with intermittent asthma. When analyzing all three \\nseverity groups prospectively, there was “little evidence of a \\nchange in asthma severity over the course of pregnancy.”30 \\nThe authors then analyzed whether the women were receiv -\\ning GINA-recommended medications according to the sever -\\nity class. Importantly, for all three classes, the average GINA \\nseverity score was lower if the medications being used were \\nin accordance with guidelines.30\\nThe old adage that “asthma in pregnancy improves in \\none-third of women, is unchanged in one-third of women, \\nand worsens in one-third of women” is not supported by evi -\\ndence.16,30–33 More severe asthma is more likely to remain \\nsevere or exacerbation prone during pregnancy.9,10 Women \\nwith persistent mild, moderate, or severe asthma are not \\ntaking medications according to recommended evidence, in \\nparticular the use of ICSs.2,30,31 Furthermore, quality of life \\nis reduced in early pregnancy, which can be associated with \\nsubsequent exacerbations, independent of FEV1.34 Asthma is \\na complex condition and there is heterogeneity of responses \\nto treatment.35 Perhaps it is not surprising that many general \\npractitioners reported a lack of confidence and knowledge in \\nmaking decisions in pregnant women with asthma.36\\nsafety of pharMacotherapy  dur Ing pregnancy\\nAlthough the term “appropriate” for use in pregnancy may \\nbe preferred to “safety,” the benefits of current medications \\nrequired to achieve effective control of asthma outweigh any \\npotential risks.1,8,11–14,17,18,32 The evidence supporting ICSs \\ncontinues to grow.9,37–39', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 279}),\n"," Document(page_content='262 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nFor rescue treatment, most of the data for SABAs are for \\nalbuterol (salbutamol) whereas for LABAs the safety data is \\nbased on salmeterol compared to formoterol.40 Evidence sup -\\nporting experience with the leukotriene D4 receptor antago -\\nnist, montelukast, has been published.41,42\\nIt has been speculated that oral corticosteroid administra -\\ntion for treatment of exacerbations of asthma may contribute \\nto reduced birth weights (200 g) in infants.43 Nevertheless, \\ninadequately controlled asthma is associated with reduced \\nbirth weights.

In a recent survey of patients in the Asthma \\nCare Network, nearly 75% reported symptoms indicative of \\npoorly controlled asthma.1 As a result, health-care expendi -\\ntures related to asthma are higher than the costs associated \\nwith HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis combined, due in large part \\nto poor asthma control.2 Thus, identifying factors that con -\\ntribute to poor asthma control is particularly important. It \\nhas long been appreciated that co-occurring psychological \\nsymptoms and disorders are fairly common among asthma \\npatients. Indeed, recent epidemiological work indicates that \\nindividuals with asthma are nearly 1.7 times more likely \\nthan those without to have a lifetime history of any mental \\ndisorder.3 Moreover, the presence of co-occurring psycho -\\npathology is related to greater difficulties in achieving and \\nmaintaining asthma control as well as more frequent asthma \\nexacerbations.4\\nThe purpose of the current chapter is to examine the \\nassociation between asthma and both anxiety and depres -\\nsive symptoms and disorders. The chapter will begin with \\na brief case study to illustrate some of the clinical issues \\nassociated with co-occurring asthma and anxiety and/or \\ndepression. Then we will provide a description of anxiety \\nand depressive symptoms and disorders as well as clarifi -\\ncation of appropriate terminology. Next, the prevalence of \\nanxiety and mood disorders among individuals with asthma \\nwill be reviewed, with a particular focus on the associa -\\ntion between asthma and panic disorder. Then, the effect of \\nanxiety and depression on asthma-related outcomes will be \\nexamined (i.e., severity, control, symptom perception, qual -\\nity of life, health-care use), followed by an examination of \\npsychological interventions to address comorbid asthma and \\npanic disorder. Next, a potential mechanism that contributes \\nto the asthma–anxiety association, anxiety sensitivity (fear \\nof one’s own anxiety symptoms), will be examined. Lastly, \\nlimitations of the current literature and directions for future \\nresearch will be discussed.\\nDEPRESSION AND ANXIETY OVERVIEW\\nApproximately half of the U.S. population will suffer from \\none or more psychiatric disorders at some point in their life -\\ntime.5 Of these disorders, mood and anxiety disorders are \\nthe most common, with lifetime prevalence rates of 21% and \\n29%, respectively.5 Aside from a high prevalence rate, mood \\nand anxiety disorders generally maintain a chronic, fluctuating \\ncourse, resulting in substantial impairment across the life span. \\nIn addition, anxiety and mood disorders place a large burden on \\nthe financial and social resources of society. It is estimated that \\nanxiety and mood disorders result in approximately $86 billion \\nin direct and indirect costs in the United States each year.6,7Mood dIsorders\\nMood disorders, also called affective disorders, represent a \\ncategory of mental health problems in which the primary \\nunderlying problem is an individual’s persistent emotional \\nstate or mood. There are three primary mood disorders that \\nare relevant to the current literature review: major depressive \\ndisorder (MDD), dysthymia, and bipolar disorder (formerly \\ncalled manic depression). The lifetime prevalence rate of any \\nmood disorder is 20.8%, with MDD being the most common \\n(16.6%), followed by bipolar disorder (3.9%), and dysthymia \\n(2.5%).5 Mood disorders affect individuals of all ages, but \\nthey typically manifest in the midtwenties and are more com -\\nmon in women than men.8\\nMDD is what is often thought of by the term “depres -\\nsion” and is characterized by the presence of one or more \\nmajor depressive episodes that cause significant distress and \\nimpairment. A major depressive episode is a period of two or \\nmore weeks of a depressed or irritable mood and/or markedly \\ndiminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities. \\nThese primary symptoms are accompanied by a combina -\\ntion of the following additional symptoms: significant weight \\nloss or gain, insomnia or hypersomnia, fatigue, psychomo -\\ntor agitation or retardation, feelings of worthlessness, dif -\\nficulty concentrating, and suicidal ideation.8 Dysthymia \\nis often thought of as a less severe form of MDD, because \\nmany of the symptoms of MDD are present, but to a lesser \\ndegree. It is characterized by a chronic, low-grade depressed \\nor irritable mood that lasts for at least 1 year. Bipolar disor -\\nder, in its most classic form, can be thought of as alternating \\nperiods of major depressive and manic episodes or unusual \\nshifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and the ability to carry \\nout everyday tasks. A manic episode is a period of abnor -\\nmally elevated or irritable mood that lasts for at least 1 week \\nand is accompanied by symptoms of inflated self-esteem, \\ndecreased need for sleep, pressured speech, racing thoughts, \\nand increased activity.8\\nanxIety dIsorders\\nAnxiety is a future-oriented, negative mood state that results \\nin feelings of helplessness due to a perceived inability to \\ncontrol or predict events. Anxiety consists of symptoms \\nacross physiological (e.g., sympathetic nervous system acti -\\nvation), cognitive (e.g., hypervigilance, worry), and behav -\\nioral domains (e.g., avoidance, exaggerated startle response). \\nWhile anxiety is a normal response to stressful events or the \\nanticipation of such events, anxiety becomes abnormal when \\nit is pervasive, persistent, and accompanied by excessive \\navoidance and clinically significant impairment. While prev -\\nalence rates vary across the specific anxiety disorders, the \\nlifetime prevalence rate for any anxiety disorder is 28.8%.5 \\nThe most common anxiety disorder is specific phobia with a \\nlifetime prevalence rate of 12.5%, followed by social phobia \\n(12.1%), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 6.8%), gen -\\neralized anxiety disorder (GAD; 5.7%), separation anxiety \\ndisorder (5.2%), panic disorder (4.7%), obsessive–compulsive ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 284}),\n"," Document(page_content='267 Anxiety and Depression and Asthma\\ndisorder (OCD; 1.6%), and agoraphobia without panic disor -\\nder (1.4%).5\\nA specific phobia is an extreme or irrational fear of a spe -\\ncific object or situation (e.g., heights, snakes, flying). Social \\nphobia is a marked or persistent fear of social or perfor -\\nmance situations involving unfamiliar people or scrutiny by \\nothers. PTSD consists of symptoms of reexperiencing (e.g., \\nflashbacks), avoidance, and physiological arousal (e.g., exag -\\ngerated startle response) following exposure to a traumatic \\nevent where an individual experienced extreme fear, help -\\nlessness, or horror.8 Generalized anxiety disorder is typi -\\ncally what is thought of by the term “anxiety” and consists \\nof periods of intense worry that are excessive, pervasive, and \\nuncontrollable. Separation anxiety disorder is a disorder of \\nchildhood only, that is characterized by developmentally \\ninappropriate and excessive anxiety regarding separation \\nfrom home or from those to whom the individual is attached. \\nPanic disorder consists of recurrent or unexpected panic \\nattacks (discrete periods of fear in which physical symptoms \\ndevelop abruptly and peak within 10 min) as well as worry \\nabout future panic attacks and avoidance of situations that \\nmight produce panic attacks. OCD consists of intrusive and \\nrecurring thoughts (obsessions) that often result in repetitive \\nbehaviors or rituals that are repeated excessively to reduce \\nanxiety (compulsions). Agoraphobia, or anxiety about being \\nin a place or situation where escape might be difficult in the \\nevent of a panic attack, can occur within the context of panic \\ndisorder or alone.8\\nterMInology\\nIn the literature reviewed in the remainder of the chapter, \\nmental health terms are not always used consistently or accu -\\nrately. Thus, there is a need to clarify terms that will be used \\nthroughout the chapter. The terms “anxiety” and “depres -\\nsion” will be used to refer to global levels of anxiety and \\ndepression symptoms  and not to clinical levels of anxiety and \\ndepression (i.e., disorders ). When referring to clinical levels \\nof anxiety and depression, the terms “anxiety disorders” and \\n“mood disorders” will be used, or the specific anxiety or \\nmood disorder will be identified. Although not an officially \\nrecognized category of disorders, the term “depressive dis -\\norders” is often used to indicate mood disorders that only \\ninclude depression (e.g., MDD, dysphoria) and not mania \\n(e.g., bipolar disorder) by many researchers. This term will \\nbe utilized in this manner throughout the chapter as well.\\nCO-OCCURRENCE OF ASTHMA AND \\nANXIETY AND MOOD DISORDERS\\nIn addition to being common in the general population, \\nanxiety and mood disorders are even more common among \\nindividuals with asthma. The presence of asthma has been \\nlinked with anxiety and mood disorders across developmen -\\ntal periods, and clinical and nonclinical samples, and using a \\nvariety of methodologies (e.g., longitudinal, cross-sectional, \\nepidemiological).chIldren\\nEpidemiological data indicate that children with asthma, \\ncompared with those without, are more likely to have any \\nanxiety disorder (OR = 1.6), specific phobia (OR = 1.70), \\nseparation anxiety (OR = 1.82), and GAD (OR = 1.89), \\nwhile children with a chronic illness other than asthma are \\nmore likely to meet criteria for any depressive disorder.9 \\nSimilarly, in a nonclinical sample, adolescents with asthma, \\ncompared with those without, were nearly twice as likely to \\nhave an anxiety or depressive disorder.10 Factors associated \\nwith the presence of comorbid depressive or anxiety disor -\\nders included female gender, more recent asthma diagnosis, \\nliving in a single-parent household, greater externalizing \\nbehaviors, and greater functional impairment.10 However, at \\nleast one study has found that associations between asthma \\nand depressive and anxiety disorders are no longer signifi -\\ncant after controlling for confounding factors (e.g., exposure \\nto childhood adversity).11\\nadults\\nFindings from studies among adults generally mirror what \\nis found in children and adolescents. On average, the preva -\\nlence rate of any anxiety disorder among adults with asthma \\nis 34%.12 The most common co-occurring anxiety diagnoses \\namong adults with asthma are panic disorder (12%), ago -\\nraphobia (12%), and GAD (9%). Prevalence rates for these \\ndisorders are significantly higher than those found among \\nindividuals without asthma, while rates of specific phobia, \\nsocial phobia, and PTSD are similar to, or lower than, rates \\namong individuals without asthma.12 Contrary to what has \\nbeen found in children and adolescents with asthma, in a \\ncross-national study of adults, early-onset MDD (OR = 1.91), \\npanic disorder/agoraphobia (OR = 1.86), and any depres -\\nsive/anxiety disorder (OR = 1.54) each predicted adult-onset \\nasthma independent of the effects of childhood adversity.13 In \\nterms of differential associations based on asthma severity, \\ncurrent nonsevere asthma has been found to be associated \\nwith an increased likelihood of having any mood disorder \\n(OR = 2.42), and current severe asthma has been associated \\nwith increased risk for any anxiety disorder (OR = 2.65), spe -\\ncific phobia (OR = 4.78), and panic disorder (OR = 4.61).14 \\nIn this same study, lifetime severe asthma was associated \\nwith an increased risk for any anxiety disorder, panic dis -\\norder, specific phobia, social phobia, GAD, and bipolar dis -\\norder, while lifetime nonsevere asthma was associated with \\nincreased odds of any anxiety disorder, anxiety disorder not \\notherwise specified, and somatoform disorder.\\nasthMa and panIc psychopathology\\nAlthough extant research has clearly documented an asso -\\nciation between asthma and both depressive and anxiety \\ndisorders, there is evidence for a relatively specific associa -\\ntion between asthma and panic psychopathology (i.e., panic \\nattacks, panic disorder, and agoraphobia). Indeed, rates of ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 285}),\n"," Document(page_content='268 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\npanic attacks and panic disorder are consistently higher \\namong individuals with asthma compared with the gen -\\neral population.14,15 Moreover, there appears to be a dose–\\nresponse relationship, such that with every additional panic \\nsymptom the likelihood of asthma increases.15,16 A recent \\n20-year longitudinal study found a significant bidirectional \\nrelationship between the two; asthma was a significant pre -\\ndictor of future panic disorder (OR = 4.5), and panic disorder \\npredicted later asthma activity (OR = 6.3).16\\nIMPACT OF CO-OCCURRING \\nANXIETY AND DEPRESSION\\nasthMa sever Ity\\nDue to the high rates of co-occurrence between asthma and \\nboth anxiety and depression, researchers have begun to exam -\\nine the effects of these comorbid mental health conditions \\non asthma severity, including asthma symptoms and pulmo -\\nnary function. Among youth, the presence of one or more \\nanxiety or depressive disorders has been found to be associ -\\nated with greater asthma symptoms, with a linear increase \\nin asthma symptoms as severity of anxiety and depressive \\ndisorders increases.17 Similarly, depression has been found to \\nbe associated with greater asthma severity and a greater risk \\nfor future hospitalization due to asthma.18\\nIn terms of pulmonary function, one study found that \\nthe presence of depression, but not anxiety, was associated \\nwith decreased FEV1 and FEV1/FVC values, independent \\nof asthma severity.19 The nonsignificant findings for anxi -\\nety, however, may be due to the small sample size in this \\nstudy ( n = 38). When looking at diagnoses, current or life -\\ntime MDD, but not GAD, panic disorder, or PTSD, are pre -\\ndictive of slightly lower FEV1 and FEV25%–75%, but only \\namong males.20 The results, however, have not always been \\nconsistent. Indeed, Lavoie and colleagues found no differ -\\nences between those with and without a mood or anxiety \\ndisorder in terms of pulmonary function, asthma duration, \\nasthma severity, presence of atopy, and number of emer -\\ngency department visits (ED) or hospitalizations in the past \\nyear.21\\nThere are a few studies examining associations between \\nanxiety and depression and asthma-related death, with con -\\nflicting results. In one historical cohort and nested case \\ncontrol study, there was an increased mortality rate among \\nasthma patients with comorbid depression22 (OR  = 1.87); \\nhowever, the authors caution that the cause of this association \\nhas yet to be examined. On the other hand, other work has \\nfound similar or even lower mortality rates among asthma \\npatients reporting depression or anxiety symptoms.23,24 \\nThere is also a small but growing body of literature exam -\\nining increased risk of suicidal ideation (OR = 2.3), suicide \\nattempts (OR = 3.5), and death by suicide among individuals \\nwith asthma.25–27 There are, however, a number of method -\\nological limitations to many of the studies in this area; thus, \\nfurther research is needed before any definitive conclusions \\nabout the impact of depression or anxiety on asthma-related death as well as the impact of asthma on suicidal ideation and \\nbehavior can be made.\\nasthMa control\\nThe results for asthma control, on the other hand, are more \\nconsistent. The majority of studies in this domain have found \\nthat anxiety and depression (both symptoms and disorders) \\nare associated with poorer asthma control.21,28,29 Compared \\nwith individuals without psychiatric disorders, individu -\\nals with comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders report \\ngreater bronchodilator use, more nocturnal waking, and \\nworse symptoms in the morning, shortness of breath, and \\nwheezing, despite no differences in measures of lung func -\\ntion.29 In an epidemiological survey, individuals with an \\nanxiety or depressive disorder were more likely to have had \\nan asthma attack in the past 30 days and more than three ED \\nor doctor’s office visits in the past year.30 Further, individu -\\nals with a lifetime history of an anxiety disorder were nearly \\ntwice as likely to have used an inhaler more than 30 times in \\nthe past 30 days compared with those without such a history.\\nThere is some question as to whether the effects of depres -\\nsion on asthma are stronger or more severe than the effects of \\nanxiety. Although the body of literature is small, a few stud -\\nies have found that only those with depressive, but not anxi -\\nety, disorders reported poorer asthma control.21,31 However, \\nthere are also studies that have found that both anxiety and \\ndepression are independent predictors of asthma control.28 \\nSimilar contradictory findings can be seen when looking \\nat the interaction of anxiety and depression. Lavoie and \\ncolleagues found no significant increase in risk for poorer \\nasthma control associated with the presence of both anxi -\\nety and depressive disorders.21 However, another study found \\nthat only a combination of anxiety and depression was a sig -\\nnificant predictor of poor asthma control.32\\nsyMptoM percept Ion\\nOne potential explanation for the association between anxi -\\nety and depression and poor asthma control is that these \\nconditions affect symptom perception, a key component in \\nasthma management. Previous research indicates that anxi -\\nety and depression are associated with greater frequency \\nof self-reported hyperventilation and airway obstruction \\nsymptoms.33 However, it is unclear whether individuals with \\ncomorbid asthma and anxiety or depression perceive, report, \\nor recall their asthma symptoms differently, or whether they \\nare truly experiencing more symptoms. One study examined \\nsymptom perception in childhood asthma and found that, \\nafter controlling for pulmonary function, trait anxiety was \\nassociated with heightened symptom perception at baseline, \\nbut not during a methacholine challenge.34 Such findings lend \\nsupport to the idea that individuals with high anxiety tend \\nto pay more attention to (i.e., overperceive) ambiguous (i.e., \\nmild) symptoms, but are able to accurately perceive symp -\\ntoms of changes in bronchoconstriction.

Some studies have found that when con -\\ntrolling for the effects of anxiety, depression is no longer a \\nsignificant predictor of quality of life.32 On the other hand, in \\na study of patients with poorly controlled asthma, when con -\\ntrolling for the effects of anxiety, only depression was found \\nto be a significant predictor of poorer quality of life.33 The \\nsubstantial overlap between depression and anxiety symp -\\ntoms may partly explain these inconsistent findings. Similar \\ninconsistencies have been found when trying to determine \\nwhether the presence of both anxiety and depression is worse \\nthan either alone. One study found an additive negative effect \\nof having depression in addition to anxiety in terms of qual -\\nity of life;32 however, no such additive effect was found in a \\nstudy of patients with poorly controlled asthma.33\\nhealth-care use\\nDepression and anxiety have also been associated with greater \\nasthma-related health-care use.28 Higher levels of anxiety are \\nassociated with higher rates of ED visits, more frequent rou -\\ntine and unscheduled medical visits and overnight hospital -\\nizations, greater use of short-acting beta-agonists, and more \\nfrequent need for oral corticosteroid treatment.28 Independent \\nof objective pulmonary functioning, individuals with anxiety \\ntend to overuse short-acting beta-agonist medication, receive \\nmore intensive corticosteroid regimens, and have longer and \\nmore frequent hospitalizations.39–41 Comorbid asthma and \\npanic disorder seem to be particularly problematic. These \\npatients are over six times as likely to visit their primary care \\nprovider and report greater use of short-acting beta-agonists \\ncompared with those with asthma only.4,42\\nAt least two studies have found that depression, but not \\nanxiety, is associated with greater health-care use. In one, \\ndepression, but not anxiety, was found to be associated with \\nmore frequent unscheduled doctor’s visits.33 Another found \\nthat depression was associated with more hospital visits and \\ngreater number of days on oral corticosteroids in the past \\nyear, even after controlling for anxiety.36 While the majority \\nof studies have focused on asthma-related health-care use, it \\nshould be noted that at least one study found that the increase \\nin health-care costs among individuals with asthma and comorbid anxiety and depression was related to treatment of \\nthe mental health condition and not to asthma.38\\nINTERVENTIONS FOR CO-OCCURRING \\nANXIETY AND DEPRESSION\\nWith the high rates of depression and anxiety found among \\nindividuals with asthma and the resulting increases in mor -\\nbidity and functional impairment, there is a clear need for \\ninterventions to treat these comorbid problems. Thus, it is \\nsurprising that, despite the existence of well-validated and \\nhighly efficacious cognitive behavioral treatments for anxi -\\nety and depressive disorders, there has been little attempt \\nto apply cognitive behavioral principles to develop effica -\\ncious treatments for asthma patients with comorbid anxiety \\nor depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in this \\ncontext would focus on understanding and changing dys -\\nfunctional behaviors and beliefs about bodily symptoms and \\nthe asthma diagnosis itself (e.g., perceived burden associated \\nwith asthma management).\\nDue to their high rates of co-occurrence, the majority of \\nwork in this area has focused on developing interventions \\nto treat comorbid asthma and panic disorder. To date, there \\nhave been two different CBT interventions developed to treat \\ncomorbid asthma and panic disorder. The first intervention \\nwas a nurse-administered 8-week group treatment program \\nthat combined CBT for panic disorder with asthma educa -\\ntion.43 The CBT portion of the treatment program consisted \\nof four major components: (1) psychoeducation regarding the \\nnature of anxiety and panic; (2) cognitive therapy techniques \\nto identify, monitor, and modify cognitive misappraisals that \\ncontribute to and maintain panic symptoms; (3) training on \\ndiaphragmatic breathing to reduce physical symptoms that \\nmay elicit panic attacks; and (4) interoceptive exposure exer -\\ncises designed to reduce fear of the bodily sensations associ -\\nated with anxiety and panic attack symptoms.\\nThe asthma education portion of the treatment consisted \\nof six components: (1) information regarding airway inflam -\\nmation and bronchoconstriction; (2) information about the \\ncorrect use and side effects of short- and long-acting asthma \\nmedications; (3) inhaler techniques; (4) instruction about self-\\nmonitoring of symptoms; (5) asthma triggers and control strat -\\negies; and (6) action plans. Each treatment session contained a \\nCBT component and an asthma education component. For the \\nfirst 4 weeks, participants met twice weekly in small groups \\nfor 90-min sessions. For the last 4 weeks, sessions were held \\nweekly, for a total of 12 treatment sessions. Results in a study \\nof women only indicated that, compared with a wait-list con -\\ntrol, the treatment program resulted in significant reduction of \\nfrequency of panic symptoms, general anxiety, and anxiety \\nsensitivity (fear of anxiety-related sensations), and improve -\\nments in asthma-related quality of life and morning PEF rat -\\nings. The improvements in all outcomes except quality of life \\nwere maintained throughout the 6-month follow-up period.\\nThe second intervention was similar to the first and was \\na pilot test of the efficacy of a 14-session and 8-session pro -\\ntocol that combined components of CBT for panic disorder ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 287}),\n"," Document(page_content='270 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nwith asthma self-management programs.44 The 14-session \\nprotocol consisted of education about asthma, proper medi -\\ncation use, and differentiating between asthma and panic \\nsymptoms (Sessions 1–2); progressive muscle relaxation and \\nbreathing retraining (Sessions 3–5); cognitive restructur -\\ning and asthma problem solving (Sessions 6–7); exposure \\n(Sessions 8–10); asthma and medication, effective commu -\\nnication with doctors (Session 11); smoking reduction and \\ntreatment of agoraphobic symptoms (Session 12); assertive -\\nness training (Session 13); and relapse prevention (Session \\n14). The 8-session protocol was a condensed version of the \\n14-session version. Both protocols resulted in a more than \\n50% decrease in panic symptoms, significant decreases in \\nasthma symptoms, and improved asthma-related quality \\nof life. The 14-session protocol also resulted in decreased \\nshort-acting beta-agonist use; however, there was signifi -\\ncantly greater dropout rate in the 14-session (50%) com -\\npared with the 8-session protocol (18%).\\nThere has been one examination of a CBT-based preven -\\ntion program to treat individuals with asthma and high levels \\nof anxiety and asthma-related panic fear, which would place \\nthese individuals at higher risk for developing a comorbid \\nanxiety disorder.45 As with the previous two studies, this \\nintervention combined education about asthma and anxiety, \\nCBT, and asthma self-management. Treatment was tailored to \\neach individual based on a functional analysis of the relation -\\nship between his or her specific situational triggers, asthma-\\nrelated beliefs, maladaptive cognitions, attention focus, and \\nphysiological factors. Based on this analysis, the intervention \\ncould contain the following components: (1) education about \\nasthma and how to differentiate between asthma and anxiety \\nsymptoms; (2) self-monitoring of anxiety-related cognitions, \\nparticularly those involving catastrophic misinterpretation \\nof bodily sensations; (3) attention retraining; (4) exposure; \\n(5) education about methods to control hyperventilation; (6) \\nidentifying panic fear triggers; (7) improving problem-solv -\\ning skills; and (8) exploration of dysfunctional asthma-related \\nbeliefs. After an introductory 1.5-h session, sessions were \\n1 h in length and occurred weekly for 4–6 weeks. Results \\nindicated that the intervention resulted in a significant reduc -\\ntion of asthma-related panic fear, but not general anxiety, by \\nthe end of treatment, and this reduction was maintained at \\nthe 6-month follow-up. There were also significant improve -\\nments in asthma-related quality of life and depression at the \\nend of treatment, but these gains were not maintained at the \\n6-month follow-up.\\nANXIETY SENSITIVITY: A POTENTIAL \\nPSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISM\\nResearch has clearly documented substantial negative health \\neffects as well as personal and economic costs associated \\nwith co-occurring asthma and depression and/or anxi -\\nety, particularly for co-occurring panic disorder. However, \\nlittle is known about the etiology of these associations and \\nwhat factors may serve to maintain them. Efforts to under -\\nstand these underlying mechanisms would not only fill an important gap within the empirical literature, but would also \\nprovide specific targets for intervention efforts that could \\nimprove asthma control and ultimately reduce health-care \\ncosts. One way in which to accomplish this task is to identify \\nmalleable psychological risk factors for not only mood and \\nanxiety symptoms and disorders, but also for poor asthma \\ncontrol. Given the particularly strong relationship between \\nasthma and panic disorder, we focus here on one panic-\\nrelated risk factor that has been receiving increased research \\nattention in terms of its association with asthma, namely \\nanxiety sensitivity.\\nAnxiety sensitivity is a modifiable cognitive predisposition \\ndefined as the fear of anxiety-related physical and psycholog -\\nical sensations that is theoretically and empirically distinct \\nfrom the tendency to experience negative affect.46 Anxiety \\nsensitivity encompasses three lower-order dimensions: phys -\\nical, cognitive, and social concerns that load onto a single \\nhigher-order factor.47 When anxious, individuals with high \\nanxiety sensitivity become acutely fearful due to beliefs that \\nthese anxiety-related interoceptive sensations have harmful \\nphysical, psychological, or social consequences. In line with \\nthis theory, anxiety sensitivity is concurrently and prospec -\\ntively associated with an increased risk of anxiety symptoms \\nand with the onset of certain anxiety disorders, most notably \\npanic disorder and PTSD.48,49\\nAlthough not yet empirically tested, a cognitive behav -\\nioral model may help explain how anxiety sensitivity impacts \\nasthma. Individuals with asthma tend to be fearful of pulmo -\\nnary-based and other bodily sensations and may react with \\ngreater levels of anxiety or related negative affect when con -\\nfronted with such stressors. Since anxiety sensitivity results \\nin the amplification of negative emotional experiences, an \\nindividual with asthma who is high in anxiety sensitivity \\nwould perceive bodily sensations associated with autonomic \\narousal as a sign of imminent harm, resulting in greater dis -\\ntress about these physical sensations and an increased ten -\\ndency to catastrophize about them, resulting in avoidance of \\nsituations that may elicit such sensations. As a result, this \\nasthma patient with high anxiety sensitivity would likely \\nexperience elevated levels of anxiety and be at risk for devel -\\noping panic disorder as well as increased asthma symptoms \\nand exacerbations.\\nResearch examining anxiety sensitivity and asthma, \\nalthough limited, is promising. For example, anxiety sensitiv -\\nity has been shown to significantly predict panic in response \\nto symptoms of asthma (i.e., panic fear) independently of \\nasthma severity.50 Other work has found that patients with \\natopic asthma have higher levels of anxiety sensitivity than \\nthose with nonatopic asthma.51 In terms of asthma-related \\noutcomes, anxiety sensitivity, particularly the physical con -\\ncerns facet, has been found to significantly predict asthma \\ncontrol and asthma-related quality of life among individu -\\nals with self-reported and physician-verified asthma diagno -\\nses.52,53 These effects were significant even after controlling \\nfor relevant demographic variables and negative affect. These \\nfindings suggest that individuals with asthma who are fearful \\nof physiological arousal are a particularly “at risk” population ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 288}),\n"," Document(page_content='271 Anxiety and Depression and Asthma\\nfor poor asthma control and that there may be utility in reduc -\\ning anxiety sensitivity levels to improve asthma control.\\nSUMMARY\\nOverall, extant research indicates a significant association \\nbetween asthma and depression and anxiety in terms of \\nboth global symptoms and specific disorders, most notably \\npanic disorder. The presence of co-occurring anxiety and \\ndepression negatively impacts asthma, particularly in terms \\nof asthma control, quality of life, and health-care usage. \\nAlthough the findings are not consistent, co-occurring anxi -\\nety and depression do appear to be associated with greater \\nasthma severity in terms of more severe and frequent symp -\\ntoms, more frequent hospitalizations, and greater medication \\nuse. However, the majority of studies also found that there was \\nno effect of co-occurring anxiety and depression on objective \\nmeasures of lung function. Indeed, it appears as if one of the \\nprimary ways in which anxiety, in particular, exerts its influ -\\nence on asthma is through increased symptom perception, \\nparticularly for ambiguous symptoms. Such overperception \\nof symptoms is problematic as individuals with asthma rely \\non their subjective experience of asthma symptoms to guide \\nthe management of their asthma and physicians tend to rely \\nmore heavily on patients’ subjective reports of asthma symp -\\ntoms than on objective assessments of lung function to inform \\ntreatment decisions (e.g., medication class or dosage).54 As a \\nresult, co-occurring anxiety and depression appear to result \\nin poorer asthma outcomes in the absence of actual physical \\ncauses. Thus, interventions to treat anxiety and depression \\nare needed to reduce this overperception. Although there are \\npsychological treatments for comorbid asthma and panic dis -\\norder, little attention has been given to developing preventive \\ninterventions for asthma patients that would target risk fac -\\ntors for developing comorbid anxiety or mood disorders. One \\npotential target that has been identified is anxiety sensitiv -\\nity. Exposure-based techniques to reduce anxiety sensitivity \\nhave been used to improve outcomes in other health prob -\\nlems (e.g., smoking cessation),55 but have yet to be applied \\namong asthma patients. Such interventions are shorter than \\nexisting CBT interventions for comorbid anxiety and asthma \\nand can easily be implemented in a clinic setting.\\nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\\nAlthough a great deal of research attention has been paid to \\nco-occurring asthma and depression and anxiety, a number \\nof directions for research in this area remain relatively unex -\\nplored. Much of this research has focused on documenting \\nthis co-occurrence and its effects, and less research attention \\nhas been paid to developing and testing theoretical models to \\nexplain the etiology and maintenance of this co-occurrence. \\nSuch a theory would not only guide research, but also pro -\\nvide a framework for understanding how data from various \\nstudies fit together. Furthermore, it is difficult to draw defini -\\ntive conclusions about the associations between anxiety and \\ndepression and asthma based on the numerous discrepancies found in extant research. These discrepancies are due, in part, \\nto the types of samples used (e.g., community vs. clinical), but \\nalso to what specifically is being examined (e.g., anxiety or \\ndepression or both) and how variables are defined. In terms of \\nanxiety and depression, both have been looked at as symptoms \\nas well as clinical disorders. No studies, to our knowledge, \\nhave examined the differential effects on asthma outcomes of \\nsubclinical levels of anxiety and depression symptoms com -\\npared with actual clinical anxiety and depressive disorders. \\nSuch work would provide important information about which \\nlevels of anxiety and depression are particularly problem -\\natic, and what specific effects these differing levels have on \\nasthma. Further, it may be useful to clarify the definition of \\nthe constructs used as well as the method of their assessment \\nto increase consistency across studies.\\nAlong these same lines, researchers often combine a wide \\nrange of anxiety or mood disorders into one group, rather \\nthan examining each disorder individually. This strategy is \\nunderstandable, as relatively large sample sizes are needed to \\nhave sufficient representation of each disorder. However, it is \\nthen difficult to ascertain associations between specific anxi -\\nety or mood disorders and asthma. Moreover, studies looking \\nat classes of disorders do not necessarily include all disorders \\nwithin a certain class. That is, when researchers examine \\nanxiety disorders, they typically do not include every anxiety \\ndisorder. Thus, even the conclusions about anxiety disorders \\nas a class can be somewhat misleading since they do not cover \\nall anxiety disorders. Similarly, researchers have focused pri -\\nmarily on the depression end of the spectrum of mood dis -\\norders, and little research has been done on the effects of \\ndisorders involving mania (e.g., bipolar disorder). This lack \\nof attention is unfortunate as at least one study found that \\nbipolar disorder is associated with lifetime severe asthma.14\\nMore research is needed to examine the differential \\neffects of depression and anxiety on asthma. Several stud -\\nies attempted to determine whether anxiety or depression, \\nor both, exerted a stronger negative effect on asthma, with \\nconflicting results.21,28,31–33 There is substantial symptom \\noverlap between anxiety and depression, and most self-report \\nmeasures of depression and anxiety do not take this over -\\nlap into consideration. The tripartite model is one attempt \\nto differentiate between anxiety and depression. This model \\nposits that negative affectivity serves as a general distress \\nfactor, lack of positive affect is specific to depression, and \\nautonomic arousal is specific to anxiety.56 Measures based \\non this conceptualization (e.g., Inventory of Depression and \\nAnxiety Symptoms) contain scales that assess symptoms \\nspecific to anxiety and specific to depression.56 Use of such \\nmeasures in future research may help clarify the differential \\neffects of depression and anxiety. In addition, there is a need \\nto more clearly differentiate between subjective and objec -\\ntive measures of asthma outcomes. Research has shown that \\nasthma patients with co-occurring anxiety, in particular, tend \\nto perceive more symptoms than would be expected based on \\nobjective measures of lung function.35 Unfortunately, various \\nmeasures of asthma control and asthma severity are largely \\nbased on patients’ subjective reports of symptoms. Thus, it ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 289}),\n"," Document(page_content='272 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nis unclear to what extent anxiety and depression actually \\nexert a negative influence on asthma outcome measures as \\nthe effects of depression and anxiety on symptom perception \\ncould confound significant findings.\\nThe majority of studies have compared individuals with \\nasthma to those without; however, anxiety and depression \\nare commonly found among most chronic medical condi -\\ntions.

The main \\ngoal was to lessen the burden of asthma on individuals and \\nsociety. The program has been a success, which is attributed \\nto early diagnosis, active anti-inflammatory treatment from \\nthe outset of disease, guided self-management, and effective \\nnetworking with general practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, \\nand nongovernmental organization (NGO) patient advocates \\n(i.e., patient associations). The Finnish experience demon -\\nstrated that careful planning and simple interventions (i.e., \\ndefined goals and systematic follow-up), over a relatively \\nshort period of time, significantly reduced patient morbidity \\nand the economic burden associated with asthma on society. \\nThe proper management of asthma involves all stakeholders, \\nnot just the patient. Most of the suffering due to asthma is \\nunnecessary and considerable cost savings can be obtained \\nif the best clinical practices are implemented in a system -\\natic way. However, reducing the incidence of asthma remains \\na challenge. In the footsteps of the Asthma Programme , a \\nnew Allergy Programme 2008 –2018  is being implemented in \\nFinland to extend the benefits of the Asthma Programme to \\nother allergic conditions. The preliminary outcomes of this program, the purpose of which is to increase immunological \\ntolerance by promoting both primary and secondary preven -\\ntion, appear promising.\\nASTHMA BURDEN\\nAsthma is an important public health issue and causes sig -\\nnificant suffering and disability resulting in increased health-\\ncare costs.\\nThe scale of the asthma and allergy epidemic around \\nthe world is tremendous. The number of patients suffering \\nfrom asthma has doubled over the past 10 years. The World \\nHealth Organization (WHO) estimates that 300 million \\npeople around the world are affected by this disease and its \\nincidence is still rising; it is projected to afflict 100 million \\npatients by 2025.\\nApproximately 250,000 people are estimated to die pre -\\nmaturely each year as a result of asthma,1,2 although overall \\nmortality rates have fallen since the 1980s.1 Although asthma \\ndeaths represent only the tip of the asthma burden pyramid \\n(Figure 27.1), they reflect the overall lack of efficacy and \\norganization of treating patients. It is the author’s conserva -\\ntive estimate that in the European Union at least 2 million \\nhospital days have been allocated for acute asthma treatment. \\nNo estimate exists for emergency room visit numbers.27Managing Asthma and Allergy\\nA Countrywide Approach to Integrating Care\\nTari Haahtela\\nCONTENTS\\nSummary  ................................................................................................................................................................................... 277\\nAsthma Burden  ......................................................................................................................................................................... 277\\nFailures and Pitfalls of Treatment  ............................................................................................................................................. 278\\nThe Finnish Initiative  ................................................................................................................................................................ 280\\nGoals: Simple and Measurable ............................................................................................................................................. 280\\nResults: The Burden of Asthma Has Decreased  .................................................................................................................. 281\\nCosts Are Down for Patients and Society  ............................................................................................................................ 281\\nPatient Benefits: Early Detection, Timely Treatment  ........................................................................................................... 281\\nOther Countries: Same Success  ........................................................................................................................................... 281\\nExpanding to All Allergic Conditions  ....................................................................................................................................... 281\\nNew Knowledge: A Prerequisite to Motivation  ................................................................................................................... 281\\nInspiring Goals  ..................................................................................................................................................................... 282\\nDefined Methods  .................................................................................................................................................................. 282\\nOutcomes and Preliminary Results  ...................................................................................................................................... 283\\nCooperation Both Nationally and Internationally  ................................................................................................................ 283\\nStop Asthma Deaths  .................................................................................................................................................................. 283\\nWhat Have We Learned?  ........................................................................................................................................................... 283\\nReferences  ................................................................................................................................................................................. 284', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 295}),\n"," Document(page_content='278 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nNot surprisingly, asthma is associated with enormous \\nhealth-care expenditures. Almost 10 years ago the annual \\nasthma-related costs in the EU amounted to €18 billion, \\nwhile the estimated loss of productivity was approximately \\n€10 billion per year. A systematic review showed that despite \\nthe availability of effective therapies, the costs of treating \\nasthma are increasing.3\\nFAILURES AND PITFALLS OF TREATMENT\\nAsthma usually responds well to appropriate medication. \\nThe treatment of choice for asthma is inhaled corticoste -\\nroids (ICSs), which control airway inflammation and relieve \\nbronchoconstriction. If optimally utilized, mortality in \\nasthma could be almost abolished and hospital days reduced \\nsignificantly.\\nWhy treatment still fails far too often is still unclear. From \\nthe public health perspective, the key issue is to implement \\nthe best standards of care in everyday practice. Effective \\nimplementation requires networking with general practi -\\ntioners (GPs), nurses, pharmacists, and patient advocacy \\norganizations. Family doctors, primary care physicians, and \\npediatricians are usually the patient’s first contact with health \\ncare and therefore play a vital role in the early diagnosis and \\nintroduction of appropriate treatment.4 All health-care pro -\\nfessionals should be aware of the excellent possibilities of \\nsignificantly improving asthma outcomes.\\nThere are numerous national and international guidelines \\nfor the evaluation, management, and treatment of asthma. \\nHowever, the critical charge is to effectively implement these \\nrecommendations into practice. While evidence-based medi -\\ncine (EBM) is an important tool, it is used retrospectively; \\nwhat is needed is an approach that allows the doctor to cur -\\nrently treat a patient and plan for future treatment. A system is \\nneeded to adapt EBM guidelines sensibly to individual patient \\ncare. They are not army rules that can be applied to everyone!\\nIndividual patients should be educated to understand their \\ndisease and provided with tools for self-management. Guided \\nself-management  is the key to proactively prevent attacks \\nand exacerbations, which cause the most trouble and costs \\n(Figure 27.2). A concept of mini-attacks could be adapted: every time the patient needs a short (rapid)-acting beta2-\\nadrenergic agonist (SABA) for breathlessness, it is a mini-\\nattack ! The patient should know what to do when the need \\nfor treatment is increasing.\\nPatients only take 30%–40% of their prescribed doses of \\ninhaled medication.5 For tablets the adherence is 60%–70%.5 \\nInhalation technique is inadequate in at least 50% of patients, \\nand should be taught properly at the first opportunity and \\nchecked regularly.\\nAt the population level, most asthma (70%–80%) is inter -\\nmittent or mild, and the treatment is relatively simple [ref -\\nerence needed]. More clinical studies should be done at the \\nmild end of the asthma spectrum to guide for proper treat -\\nment strategies. Intermittent asthma could be treated inter -\\nmittently; persistent disease needs regular maintenance \\nmedication.\\nIn creating clinically relevant treatment strategies, we \\nshould realize that most asthma drug studies have been \\nperformed in patients with moderately persistent asthma in \\norder to show differences between drugs. The results have \\noften been carelessly generalized to the asthmatic popula -\\ntion in general; when strictly speaking they are applicable \\nonly to those fulfilling the study-specific inclusion and exclu -\\nsion criteria. We need better evidence for different treatment \\napproaches in real-life  situations, especially for patients at \\nthe mild end of the severity spectrum.6\\nPatients with moderate to severe asthma should be care -\\nfully monitored, because they are most at risk of the need for \\nfuture emergency treatment, long-term lung function decline, \\nand increased health-care utilization costs. The problem is \\noften that insufficient anti-inflammatory treatment is pre -\\nscribed, and that patients rely too much on symptomatic \\nbeta2-agonist use. The global guidelines (GINA) had the fore -\\nsight to focus on and emphasize the need for asthma control  \\nin 2006. If control is inadequate, the anti-inflammatory treat -\\nment needs optimization, and the clinician needs to ask some \\nquestions such as: Is the patient really taking it? Is the inha -\\nlation technique correct? Does the patient need more effec -\\ntive anti-inflammatory medication or higher doses? Is there \\nsomething in the medication that, in fact, worsens asthma \\ncontrol (such as regular use of high doses of beta2-agonists, \\nor nonselective beta-blockers for cardiovascular problems).\\nFirst-line, early, and effective use of ICSs has revolu -\\ntionized asthma treatment. However it is unknown whether \\nICSs prevent lung function decline (measured by FEV1), \\nwhich may take place over the years in moderate to severe \\nasthma and is caused by permanent structural changes of \\nthe airway wall (remodeling). In other words, do ICSs have \\nthe potential to change the natural course of asthma? The \\nfirst study that suggested this may be the case was Haahtela \\net\\xa0al.,7 and 10-year observational data from Denmark seem to \\nconfirm this.8 Busse et al.9 and O’Byrne et al.10 also showed \\nthat severe asthma exacerbations are associated with a more \\nrapid decline in lung function, and maintenance treatment \\nwith low doses of ICSs prevents severe asthma-related events \\nand attenuates lung function decline. The question, however, \\nremains open.Take asthma into control–\\nhit early and hit hard !\\nReduce a sthm a\\nburden !Zero tolerance t o\\nasthma att acksAsthma att acks (deaths )\\nEmergen cy,\\nexacer bation\\nvisits\\nBed days,\\nhospitaliz ations\\nDisability : days oﬀ\\nwork, scho ol, pe nsions ....\\nCost s\\nFIGURE  27.1 Asthma deaths comprise only the very top of the \\nasthma burden pyramid.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 296}),\n"," Document(page_content='279 Managing Asthma and Allergy\\nAt the population level, most asthma is intermittent or \\nmild and relatively easy to control. These patients do not face \\nany clinically significant lung function loss over time, what -\\never the treatment. Nevertheless, the ICS-responsive inflam -\\nmatory changes seem to be present even in the mildest forms \\nof asthma, or even in patients with asthma-like symptoms (or \\npre-asthma).6 Therefore, these patients should be prescribed \\nanti-inflammatory or controller treatment rather than beta2-\\nagonists alone.11 It is also evident that many adults and chil -\\ndren with mild forms of disease can cope with intermittent \\nrather than continuous treatment.12,13 In these patients, the \\neffect of ICSs on lung function is difficult or even impossible \\nto verify.\\nIt is increasingly clear that genetic polymorphism affects \\nindividual patients’ responses to drugs. While many patients \\nrespond to low doses of ICSs, there are patients who need \\nhigh doses and do not demonstrate the expected clinical \\nresult. True corticosteroid resistance is very rare; however, \\nif the patient has comorbidities like chronic obstructive \\npulmonary disease (COPD), the ICS effect may only be \\nmodest. About 80% of patients do benefit from leukotriene \\nantagonists (LTRAs), but 20% do not. After an initial trial \\nof therapy (1–3 months), the drug should be dropped if no \\nobvious improvement is observed. LTRAs are anti-inflam -\\nmatory and may control mild asthma alone and more severe disease combined with ICSs. LTRAs are quite free from \\nside effects.\\nBeta2-receptor tolerance develops early, during the first \\nfew weeks of treatment, in a marked proportion of asthmat -\\nics. Often this is relatively harmless, if ICSs are used at the \\nsame time. However, some of these patients may deteriorate \\nwith regular high-dose long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists \\n(LABAs). Rapid-acting beta2-agonists are essential for rescue \\nuse, but fixed combinations of ICSs and LABAs are increas -\\ningly used in maintenance treatment of all asthma whether \\nmild or severe. The combination preparations have, indeed, \\ndecreased exacerbations in specified patient groups.14,15 LABAs \\ndo not, however, tackle the inflammation, and regular adminis -\\ntration causes tachyphylaxis,16 which means a reduced preven -\\ntive effect on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction as well as \\nreduced bronchodilator effect.17 LABAs should be introduced \\nfor long-term maintenance only after some thought, and always \\nconcomitantly with ICSs in patients who are not controlled \\nwith anti-inflammatory treatment alone. While patients should \\nnot be undertreated, which is still commonplace, there is an \\nemerging problem due to overtreatment.18\\nIt is conceivable that in the not-too-distant future, pharma -\\ncogenomics will provide clinicians with affordable genetic \\ntests that may predict drug response and especially explain fail -\\nures.

In young age groups there is \\nvirtually no asthma mortality. Medicine use, especially early \\nuse of ICSs to deal with the airway inflammatory process, \\nhad increased by 75% during the early years of the Program \\n(1994–1999).\\ncosts are down for patIents and socIety\\nIn spite of the still slightly increasing prevalence of asthma, \\nthe overall costs related to asthma (compensation for disability, \\nmedicines, hospital care, and outpatient doctor visits) have lev -\\neled off and started to decrease.21,24 This has been in stark con -\\ntrast to what was predicted. The overall cost of treating asthma \\nin 1993 was approximately $US446 million, including loss of \\nproductivity. By 2010, this figure had dropped to $US360 mil -\\nlion. The total asthma costs in 2010 (health-care, drugs, disabil -\\nity and production loss) were predicted to vary from $US783 \\nmillion (minimum scenario) to $US1253 million (maximum \\nscenario). The cost prediction is a theoretical model, but shows \\nthe enormous potential of cost savings by improving treatment. \\nThe estimate of the potential savings for the year 2010 alone was \\n$US423–893 million, depending on the scenario used.\\nAnnual costs per patient attributable to asthma have been \\nreduced by more than 50%.

The long-term aim of this \\nextended program was to decrease the incidence of asthma \\nand allergies.\\nThe Finnish initiative is a comprehensive plan designed \\nto change the course of allergy in society. This was launched \\nto increase both immunological and psychological tolerance \\nand to change attitudes to support health, not just allergy. \\nAllergy health emphasizes that those with allergic symptoms \\nshould not be prevented from living a normal life. For severe \\nallergies, early and effective treatment  is strongly empha -\\nsized. Guided self-management  is again the key to stopping \\nattacks proactively.\\nnew Knowledge : a p rerequ IsIte to MotIvatIon\\nThe prevalence of allergic diseases has grown in Finland dur -\\ning the past 50 years, similarly to what has been observed for \\nmany other industrialized and urbanized countries. Although \\nthe origin of allergy remains unresolved, an increasing body \\nof evidence indicates that modern man living in an urban \\nbuilt environment is deprived of environmental protective \\nfactors (e.g., soil microorganisms) that are fundamental for \\nnormal tolerance development. Reduced contact with natu -\\nral, biodiverse environments may adversely affect the human \\ncommensal microbiota and its immunomodulatory capacity. \\nRecent results from North Karelian teenagers have prompted \\nthe so-called biodiversity hypothesis , which expands the \\nwell known “hygiene and microbial deprivation” hypotheses \\nby taking into account the interrelationships of three DNA \\ncompartments: human cells, skin-mucosal microbiomes, and \\nenvironmental microbiomes.40–42', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 299}),\n"," Document(page_content='282 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nThe current dogma of allergen avoidance has not proved \\neffective in halting the “allergy epidemic,” although aller -\\ngen avoidance is, and will remain, a cornerstone in the \\ntreatment armamentarium of allergic patients. It is the \\nFinnish consensus that restoring and strengthening toler -\\nance  is the key to a balanced immune system and should be \\na focus of research in the future (Box 27.2). Understanding \\nthe mechanisms of tolerance will serve to pave the way \\nfrom the central emphasis on treatment to prevention and \\nimproved public health.InspIrIng goals\\nThe 10-year implementation program aims to reduce the bur -\\nden of allergies at both the individual and societal levels.\\nAllergy Program goals:\\n 1. Prevent the development of allergic symptoms\\n 2. Increase tolerance against allergens\\n 3. Improve diagnostic quality\\n 4. Decrease work-related allergies\\n 5. Allocate resources to manage and prevent asthma \\nand allergy attacks\\n 6. Decrease costs due to allergic diseases\\nThe goals are also numeric if the program is successful, \\nfor example, asthma emergency visits should drop 40% in \\n10 years.\\ndefIned Methods\\nFor each goal, specific tasks, tools, and evaluation methods have \\nbeen defined. We have developed tools for practical implemen -\\ntation for childhood allergies .43,44 Mild allergic symptoms are \\ncommon and should not be treated unnecessarily. Mild allergy \\nis not predestined to become more severe in time and outcomes \\nare generally favorable.45\\nSevere forms of allergy require specific focus. To help \\npatients proactively stop allergic reactions and exacerbations, \\nsimple self-management plans have been launched for aller -\\ngic rhinitis, anaphylaxis, asthma, asthma in small children, \\natopic eczema, food allergy, and urticaria. Patients are trained \\nin self-management. Disease control is strongly emphasized \\nand education is provided for both health-care personnel and \\npatients. Allergic inflammation in asthma, atopic dermatitis, \\nand rhinitis are treated most effectively very early on in the \\ncourse of illness.46 The importance of patient follow-up and \\nlong-term maintenance therapy is stressed. For children with \\nmild persistent asthma (the majority!), a strategy of intermit -\\ntent (periodic) treatment has been developed.47\\nImmunotherapy and especially sublingual immunother -\\napy (SLIT) are advocated where feasible. Food allergy diets \\nare critically reevaluated and stopped if possible. Specific \\noral tolerance induction (SOTI) for milk, wheat, and pea -\\nnuts has been studied intensively and employed increasingly \\nin clinical practice.48 Long avoidance lists of allergens or \\nirritants have been eliminated. Avoidance must be based on \\nproper diagnostic work-up and recommendations must be \\nprecise regarding what should be avoided and for how long. \\nIn patients with troublesome food allergies, a clear shift from \\npassive avoidance to active treatment has been taken.\\nNationwide implementation acts through the network of \\nlocal public health coordinators (GPs, nurses, pharmacists). \\nIn addition, three NGOs started a 5-year project in 2011 to \\nimplement these new recommendations among allergic peo -\\nple and the general public.\\nAll 21 central hospital districts are currently carrying out \\na three-step educational process:BOX 27.2 PRACTICAL ADVICE \\nFOR PROFESSIONALS TO HELP \\nPATIENTS BUILD UP AND IMPROVE \\nIMMUNE TOLERANCE AND PREVENT \\nAND TREAT INFLAMMATION\\nPrimary prevention\\n• Support breastfeeding.

Overall asthma severity determines the attack \\nrisk, and a new classification for severity has been pub -\\nlished.54 Simple tools for clinical work are needed. WHO has \\na performance score from 0 to 5 for cancer patients.55 This \\nidea could be modified for asthma based on symptoms, dis -\\nability, and medication (Table 27.1).

Both were \\ndiagnosed with persistent asthma and both began therapy \\nwith moderate-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). After this, \\nthe courses of their diseases differed.\\nJohn is an athlete whose asthma was adequately con -\\ntrolled until about 2 years ago. Now he consistently has \\nproblems during soccer and basketball practice. In addi -\\ntion, he awakes several nights a month. While his spirom -\\netry is within normal limits, he continues to remain poorly \\ncontrolled. Over the past 2 years, he has progressed from \\nhis moderate-dose ICS to a high-dose combination of ICS \\nand long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) but con -\\ntinues to use his short-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist \\n(SABA) almost daily with limited results. He is waking up to 2–3 nights a month coughing and had to sit out the last \\nsoccer practice. His family physician has assessed potential \\nallergens with in vitro assays with positive results for grasses \\nand trees. John does not appear to have seasonal symptoms \\nbut with the constant problems, seasonal assessment is dif -\\nficult. John’s mother is ready for a specialty consultation \\nand his family physician wonders if it is time to consider \\nomalizumab.\\nOn the other hand, Mary’s asthma was well controlled \\nimmediately with moderate-dose ICS and remains con -\\ntrolled most of the time. However, in the spring and fall for \\nthe past 2 years, Mary has had severe exacerbations even \\nrequiring hospitalization this March. After the hospitaliza -\\ntion, Mary finished a 21-day course of oral steroids and her \\nasthma has been under good control on moderate-dose ICS \\nplus LABA for May, June, and July. Mary, her mother, and \\nthe family physician welcome a second opinion and she will \\nsee the allergist on the same day as her brother.28Primary Care Setting and \\nIntegrating Care across \\nPrimary/Secondary Care Interface\\nBarbara P.

John’s inhaler technique is very poor for both his \\ndry powder inhaler and his metered-dose inhaler. Thinking \\nback, it becomes clear that John’s problems began when he \\nstarted using his medications in his room rather than with \\nparental supervision. Since then his inhaler technique has \\napparently deteriorated. With an appropriate technique and \\nimproved adherence, John’s asthma is again well controlled \\non moderate-dose ICS and preexercise use of SABA. The \\nallergist dismissed John with an updated asthma action plan \\nand a suggestion to the family physician to assess inhaler \\ntechnique at each visit.\\nMary’s visit takes longer and includes a detailed allergy \\nhistory and targeted allergy skin testing. The allergist rec -\\nommends consideration of either allergy desensitization or \\nanti-IgE therapy. Mary and her mother want to talk with \\ntheir family physician as well as Mary’s father and return \\nto the allergist in 2 weeks to make a decision. The allergist \\nprovides a detailed consultation summary to the family and \\nMary’s family physician. All agree that Mary’s asthma care \\nwill be a collaboration between her personal family physi -\\ncian and the allergist.\\ncoMMent\\nJohn’s consultation probably could have been avoided if \\nthe primary care physician had a systematic approach to \\nnot only assessing control but also assessing the common \\ncauses of asthma being out of control. Mary’s posthospi -\\ntal referral is recommended in all current asthma guide -\\nlines and provided options that are seldom available in \\nprimary care.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAsthma is one of the most common chronic conditions for \\nboth adults and children. Rates vary by country and are high \\nin the most developed countries: 14%–15% in the United \\nKingdom, New Zealand, Canada, Australia, and Ireland \\nand 11% in the United States. Developing countries report \\nwider variations: 13% in Peru, 12% in Costa Rica, 8% in \\nAfrica, and only 2% in China, with many cases likely to \\nbe unreported or undiagnosed. Rates in schoolchildren are \\nalways higher than those in adults1 (see ref. 2 for the United \\nStates and ref. 3 for the world). The estimated percentage of \\nthose with asthma who have persistent asthma varies widely \\nbut is seldom estimated as less than 50% of all asthma.4–6 \\nBecause asthma is such a common condition and associated \\nwith exacerbations or “attacks” requiring immediate care \\nand intervention, it is not surprising that the vast majority of \\npeople with asthma and asthma exacerbations are cared for \\nby primary care physicians. The reliance on primary care is \\ntrue even in places like the United States where specialists \\nare common.1,7,8 \\nData from many countries demonstrate the vast oppor -\\ntunities to improve asthma care and patient outcomes.4,6,9–15 Some allergists, especially in the United States, continue to \\nprovide data that people with asthma have better outcomes \\nwhen cared for by an asthma specialist.4,16 Whether this is \\ndue entirely to the additional training and expertise of the \\nallergist or to the allergists’ care system is not clear.10,16 \\nBased on information from management of other chronic \\nconditions, improving the primary care systems of care is \\nvery likely to improve asthma outcomes as it has improved \\noutcomes for people with diabetes.17,18 Asthma specialist \\ncare systems can be adapted and transferred to primary \\ncare sites and for many that is what is happening in quality-\\nimprovement (QI) programs for asthma management.19 Not \\nall attempts at improvement have been successful, but some \\nspecific tasks appear to be universally helpful. The next \\nsection of this chapter will address asthma care in primary \\ncare practices. Many of the issues discussed are addressed \\nin greater depth in other chapters in this book. When pos -\\nsible, reference is made to other chapters to guide you to \\ntools and information that can facilitate implementation of \\nsuggestions in this chapter.\\nASTHMA GUIDELINES IN PRACTICE\\nSeveral national and international guidelines have been \\nproduced to direct asthma management—Global Initiative \\nfor Asthma (GINA), Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines \\nNetwork (SIGN), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \\n(NHLBI), International Primary Care Respiratory Group \\n(IPCRG), Dutch GP guidelines, and Australian guidelines \\n(see Chapter\\xa0 5, this volume). Unfortunately, few of the \\nguidelines can be transferred directly to daily practice activ -\\nities.20–23 For example, asthma control tools have been devel -\\noped to facilitate assessment of asthma response to therapy \\nand the adequacy of asthma management.24–29 These tools \\nwere developed in response to identified gaps in practice, \\nspecifically, the failure of most medical encounter notes to \\ninclude the information required to quantify asthma signs \\nand symptoms.23,30 The control tools are used to calculate \\na score that suggests the patient’s asthma is “in control,” \\n“poorly controlled,” or somewhere between, for example, \\nAsthma Control Test (ACT), Asthma Therapy Assessment \\nQuestionnaire (ATTAQ), Asthma Control Questionnaire \\n(ACQ), and Asthma Apgar.24–26,29 The ACT and ACQ both \\nhave separate tools for children while the Asthma Apgar \\nis designed to be used by parents of very young children, \\nadolescents, and adults. After quickly assessing control, \\nit is then the responsibility of the physician or other cli -\\nnician to determine next steps. Limited data are available \\non the impact of incorporation of these tools into routine \\npractice.26 Most of the literature on the tools addresses their \\nvalidation and translation to other languages, as well as \\ncross-comparisons among the tools.24,25,27,31,32 The Asthma \\nAPGAR goes beyond assessing control to assess potential \\ncauses for inadequate control and is linked to a care algo -\\nrithm based on the 2007 US asthma guidelines to guide \\nnext steps26 (Figure  28.1).', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 306}),\n"," Document(page_content='289 Primary Care Setting and Integrating Care across Primary/Secondary Care Interface\\nFIGURE  28.1  Asthma Apgar patient survey.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 307}),\n"," Document(page_content='290 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nAll of the asthma guidelines suggest management steps \\nin response to asthma control problems. For example, in the \\n2007 NHLBI guidelines, an often ignored box to the right \\nof the steps of therapy says, “assess adherence, triggers and \\ninhaler techniques before stepping it up.”33,34\\nThe British Thoracic Society guidelines also specifi -\\ncally state, “Before initiating a new drug therapy practi -\\ntioners should check compliance with existing therapies, \\ninhaler technique, and eliminate trigger factors.”35 Despite \\nthese statements, in most primary patient care settings, \\npoor control results in an increase in medication without \\nfurther assessment of why the current therapy is not effec -\\ntive.23,26,30 Common causes of poor or inadequate control \\ninclude lack of adherence to current management program \\ndue to too many medications and cost, poor inhaler tech -\\nnique, and triggers that are unrecognized or not avoided.34 \\nPhysicians and other clinicians cite time constraints, dis -\\ncomfort in “confronting” patients about adherence, and \\nlimited knowledge of inhaler techniques as reasons to skip \\nthese steps and move forward with step-ups of therapy.36,37 \\nFailing to assess the common causes of poor or inade -\\nquate asthma control can result in a perception of a person \\nhaving “difficult-to-control asthma” with resultant over -\\nmedication.15,26 Stepping up may not result in improved \\noutcomes.\\nFor example, patients who are unable to adhere to their \\ncurrent medication regimen or unable to get medications \\nto the target organ due to poor inhaler technique or incor -\\nrect prescribed inhaler type are unlikely to have better \\ncontrol after adding yet another drug.15 For all of these \\nreasons, the system changes to improve asthma care need \\nto go beyond simply adding a control test assessment dur -\\ning asthma visits.\\nASSESSING ASTHMA CONTROL\\nTools such as the ACT, the ATTAQ, and the ACQ have \\nproven to be valid and reliable at quantifying asthma control, \\nsome in many languages24,25,30 (see Chapter 16, this volume). \\nBut as noted above, most national and primary care asthma \\nguidelines require more than a simple control score to guide \\nasthma care.33–35,38–44 The Asthma Apgar goes beyond con -\\ntrol questions and asks patients about triggers, and medica -\\ntions taken and not taken and why, as well as solicits a patient \\njudgment of the effect of therapy on the asthma symptoms. \\nLinked to an algorithm for next steps, the Asthma Apgar \\nguides next steps through assessment of steps of care beyond \\nsimply increasing medications26 (Figure 28.2). The use of \\nexhaled nitric oxide may also help.45 While usually consid -\\nered a test to identify out-of-control asthma, it may also be \\nused to demonstrate to patients the impact of actually using \\ntheir medications. In busy primary care practices where \\nphysicians address multiple conditions in any single visit, \\nhaving a system and tools to guide next steps may improve \\noutcomes to a greater degree than a simple assessment of \\ncontrol status.ASSESSING INHALER TECHNIQUE\\nEvery primary care site should have the ability to teach and \\nassess inhaler technique. Simply asking if the patient is able \\nto use the inhaler regularly, how often, why, and why not is a \\ngood start but insufficient. Consider this part of the adherence or \\ncompliance assessment and intervention. If the person’s inhaler \\ntechnique is poor, they may not be getting the medication into \\nthe lungs effectively, making them nonadherent even if they \\nnever “miss a dose.” Most practices with systems of asthma care \\nassign this task to a nonphysician such as a clinical nurse special -\\nist in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Australia, or an \\nasthma educator in the United States. In observational studies, \\nneither the health-care professional nor the patient demonstrated \\nadequate inhaler technique more than 50% of the time.46–48 If \\nthe health professional has a poor grasp of inhaler technique, \\nwho is competent to teach the patient?49 (See Chapters 14 and \\n15, this volume.)\\nIDENTIFICATION OF AND EDUCATION \\nABOUT ASTHMA TRIGGERS\\nTrigger assessment is an essential part of every primary \\ncare evaluation of asthma. Even if the patient is well con -\\ntrolled, identifying and confirming methods to avoid triggers \\nmay prevent future exacerbations. While the Asthma Apgar \\naddresses patient-suspected triggers and can be used to start \\nthe discussion of triggers, some patients will require a more \\nextensive assessment of allergies, which can be facilitated \\nusing a list of potential allergens and a discussion of seasonal \\nsymptoms. Many patients are aware of triggers including \\ntobacco, wood-fire smoke, animals, and plants but have just \\nnever been asked what they believe are their allergies. The \\nprimary care office can be the site of blood tests to screen for \\nallergies or “in some countries” skin testing.50 In other coun -\\ntries or regions, in-depth allergy assessment and initiation of \\nanti-IgE or immune therapy is best considered part of shared \\ncare with an allergist (see Chapter 10, this volume). Shared \\ncare will be the focus of the later part of this chapter.\\nCOMORBID CONDITIONS\\nOften overlooked but an important part of asthma and allergy \\nevaluation is assessment for allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis \\ncan be a substantial barrier to good asthma control. Allergic \\nRhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) provides guide -\\nlines for allergic rhinitis in asthma.41,51 Few practical tools \\nhave been developed to translate these guidelines into every -\\nday practice. However, a few simple questions may begin \\nthis process and many patients are aware of allergies26,34 (see \\nChapter 8, this volume).\\nASSESSING ADHERENCE\\nAdherence is a known barrier to management of all chronic \\ndiseases and asthma is no exception.18,37 Comments about ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 308}),\n"," Document(page_content='291 Primary Care Setting and Integrating Care across Primary/Secondary Care Interface\\nmedication adherence should be prefaced with comments \\nsuch as “Many people find it difficult to take all of their \\nmedications all of time. How often have you been able to \\ntake your medications?” When using the Asthma Apgar, the \\nlist of medications written by patients, as well as answers \\nabout why they take the medications and why not, can lead \\nto a nonconfrontational review of adherence. Qualitative \\nstudies report that patients are willing to address the issue of \\nnonadherence. In addition, asking them why they take their medications may highlight the fact that patients do or do not \\nunderstand the concept of daily “controller” medications and \\nthose to be used for acute symptoms.

Reminders, medication placement near \\nsite of a common activity, or simplifying a complex therapy \\nregimen can improve unintentional nonadherence. Knowing \\nthat failure to take the medication is unintentional saves the \\nprimary care office personnel the time that might be spent \\ntrying to convince the patient that they need the medication \\nand allows them to move directly to problem solving with \\nthe patient.\\nIntent Ional nonadherence\\nIntentional nonadherence may vary from inability to afford \\nthe medications to fear of side effects, concerns about medi -\\ncation dependency, failure to accept the diagnosis, and fail -\\nure to accept the chronic nature of asthma. One of the most \\ncommon types of nonadherence is discontinuing medications \\nwhen control is good—because symptoms are in abeyance.52 \\nIntentional nonadherence can be more time consuming to \\naddress and may require collaboration with a social worker \\nto identify financial resources or an asthma educator or phar -\\nmacist to help affirm the risk and benefit of asthma medica -\\ntion usage.\\nASSESSING LUNG FUNCTION\\nSpirometry use in asthma has limited evidence on which \\nto base recommendations but is recommended for the con -\\nfirmation of reversible airflow obstruction and, therefore, \\ndiagnosis in suspected asthma in adults and children over \\nages 5–7 years by the U.S. and the Australian national \\nasthma guidelines.34,53 The British guidelines are more \\npermissive, suggesting that spirometry is important for \\npatients with less than a high probability of asthma. For \\npatients with a high probability risk of asthma, spirometry \\nis ideal, but not required, to confirm the diagnosis unless a \\ntrial of therapy does not result in improvement.35,39 Quality-\\nassured spirometry is an important tool for primary care \\npractices and should be available for assessment of asthma \\ndiagnosis, especially in those with less clear clinical assess -\\nment for asthma, when trying to differentiate COPD from \\nasthma and for patients whose asthma is difficult to control, \\nrequiring multiple therapies.9 The data to support the use of \\nspirometry for monitoring asthma care are less sound.54,55 \\nThe SIGN guidelines suggest spirometry for monitoring \\ndifficult-to-control asthma and for people with occupational \\nexposures in order to assess possible reversible lung func -\\ntion when exposed.35\\nMany primary care practices do not have easily acces -\\nsible spirometry testing onsite to facilitate patient access. \\nWhen spirometry is available on site, problems often still \\narise related to the quality of tests performed56–58 and the \\naccuracy of interpretation of the results. Sharing spirom -\\netry care with a respiratory therapist, a respiratory nurse \\nspecialist, another primary care physician with expertise in performing quality assured spirometry, or a special -\\nist in this field may improve both the quality of the tests \\nperformed and the interpretation and use of the results \\nfor clinical practice.59 In fact, working together to make \\nhigh-quality-assured spirometry available to primary care \\npatients may be a first simple step to implementing shared \\ncare (Table 28.1).\\nSome patients require more care or more intensive care \\nthan is feasible in the primary care office. While guidelines \\noften define when patients with asthma should be referred for \\nspecialty care, that decision is best made by the physician and \\nthe patient and family. Some primary care teams are quite \\ncomfortable caring for patients with moderate to moderately \\nsevere asthma and do so. Other primary care teams have \\ntrouble caring for even mild or intermittent asthma, usually \\ndue to the lack of an asthma care system.\\nPRIMARY CARE TEAMS\\nDeveloping primary care teams and delegating responsi -\\nbilities to appropriately trained individuals, rather than \\nrelying on physicians alone, is a major advance when \\ndeveloping care systems and implementing the medical \\nhome concept.60 In several countries that have a national \\nhealth system, other groups of health professionals have \\nbeen developed to provide asthma care both for those with \\nstable asthma and for those with more difficult-to-control \\nasthma. Practice nurses have been trained to provide rou -\\ntine asthma care and support the primary care physicians’ \\npractices.34,35,53 Some sites define “specialty respiratory \\nnurses” who see complicated patients and help monitor \\ntheir asthma.28,29 The final level of referral remains the \\nspecialist physician—an allergist or a respirologist. All of \\nthese levels and layers can work together to provide shared \\ncare but only if that shared care is intentional rather than \\nhappenstance.7 Shared care assures that the patient has \\naccess to the specialty services they need while retaining \\nthe whole person care that all children and adults require, \\nincluding care for other acute or chronic conditions and TABLE 28.1\\nSystematizing Care\\n• Consider carrying out routine reviews by telephone for people \\nwith asthma.\\n• In primary care, people with asthma should be reviewed regularly \\nby a nurse or doctor with appropriate training in asthma \\nmanagement.\\n• The review should incorporate a written action plan.\\n• Primary care practices should maintain and use a register of \\npeople with asthma.\\n• Clinical review should be structured and utilize a standard \\nrecording system.\\n• Feedback of audit data to clinicians should link guidelines \\nrecommendations to management of individual patients.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 310}),\n"," Document(page_content='293 Primary Care Setting and Integrating Care across Primary/Secondary Care Interface\\npreventive services. This is also the basic premise of the \\nmedical home and family medicine.\\nSPECIALIST REFERRAL\\nThe timing for referral of a person with asthma to additional \\nservices will vary based on many factors (Table 28.2). While \\nguidelines have suggested benchmarks for referral, each \\nguideline is a little different and not easily translated to a \\nglobal set of recommendations. The primary care physician/\\nteam and the patient/parents are the final arbiters of this deci -\\nsion. A request for additional care and support from either \\ngroup should result in discussion of the referral, including \\nwhat is desired from the referral and whether asthma care \\nwill also continue at the primary care site.\\ncoMMunIcatIon\\nCommunication is the biggest issue in shared care. Before \\ncommunicating, the primary care physician or team must \\nconsider three things: (1) Why is a referral being made? (2) \\nTo whom should communication be made? and (3) What \\ninformation do you want back following the referral?7 The \\npurpose of the communication is to prevent some of the \\npotential adverse outcomes of shared care, such as frag -\\nmented care, patient/family confusion due to multiple and \\ndiffering health care messages, patient and provider uncer -\\ntainty of the role(s) of each of the individuals involved in \\nthe patient’s care, and failure to address the whole person \\nand potential comorbidities. Each of these concerns can \\nbe addressed briefly in the referral communication. For \\nexample, in your referral letter or even on the asthma action \\nplan, list the terms that you and the patient use to talk about \\nasthma—reactive airway disease, recurrent wheezing, and \\nso on. If a doctor uses general terms to identify medications, \\nthese should be included in the letter and on the asthma \\naction plan; for example, rescue medications or acute \\nmedications, e.g., short-acting bronchodilators; controller, \\nmaintenance, or anti-inflammatory medications, e.g., ICSs; \\nand combination medications or leukotriene modifiers. Of course, include the generic names of each type used so the \\nconsultant has both the medical information and a commu -\\nnication strategy for talking with the patient. In addition, \\nthe referrer should detail those medications prescribed for \\nallergic rhinitis such as intranasal steroids or antihista -\\nmines, as well as any comorbidity such as depression, anxi -\\nety, or the possibility of coexisting asthma and COPD so \\nthese can be considered in the consultant’s care and recom -\\nmendations and are not reevaluated with the tests you have \\nalready completed.\\nreferral  teMplate letters\\nWhile each referral can result in a one-off letter, it is easier \\nand more efficient to develop a template or list of topics to \\nbe included in the referral letter. That template should be \\nincorporated into the electronic medical record and require \\nonly a couple of keystrokes to access. Boxes 28.1 and 28.2 \\nare examples of templates for use in such letters or com -\\nmunication. This template is a combination of published \\ntemplates and the experience of the author. It is not, to date, \\nevidence\\xa0based.\\nDeciding to send a letter to the specialist is an obvi -\\nous choice when referring a patient. However, determining \\nwho else might be appropriate for formal communication \\ndepends on the stability of the asthma, the ease of obtain -\\ning and maintaining control, who is available in your region, \\nand what usual referral patterns have been established. For \\nexample, Dr. Smith in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, \\nor Australia may ask the asthma practice nurse or a specialty \\nnurse to spend extra time with a patient who needs further \\nassessment of triggers and an allergy history. In the United \\nStates help may be required by the generalist for identifica -\\ntion of the type of trigger, an allergy assessment, or spirom -\\netry, prompting referral to an allergist’s or pulmonologist’s \\noffice.\\nWhile some large health-care systems and organizations \\ndo have disease management nurses, to date few U.S. sites \\nhave office-based asthma practice nurses or regional asthma \\npractice nurses that can support asthma patients from sev -\\neral practices. Asthma educators are able to support patients \\nand families with longer and repeated episodes of asthma \\neducation and even spirometry in some cases, but they are \\nnot able to provide asthma care and pharmaceutical therapy \\noversight. So while shared care may appear quite different \\nin various countries, actually it is very similar with just a \\nbroad range of different people fulfilling the roles of edu -\\ncator, support person, spirometry technician, prescriber, and \\nexpert. In all situations, people with asthma should have their \\nhealth care anchored in a setting that not only provides and \\ncoordinates care of asthma, but also helps integrate asthma \\ncare into the care for the whole person. In the United States, \\nthis is called the “medical home,” with similar concepts for \\nprimary care around the world. For patients who are frequent \\nattendees of the emergency department (ED), urgent care, or \\nhospital casualty units for their asthma, the referring doctor \\ncould consider sending communication to those sites.

But \\nthose nurses may not be trained to deal with asthma specif -\\nically, as respiratory practice nurses are.28,61 Many school \\nand worksite nurses have limited asthma care knowledge \\nor experience. They require clear and thorough guidance \\nin the assessment and treatment of asthma problems. This \\nguidance is often provided in an asthma action plan that \\ncan be provided to both the person (family) with asthma \\nand their school, day care or work site. (See Chapters 13, \\n14, and 16, this volume.)\\nSharing care with schools has been expanded beyond care \\nof those with identified asthma to an attempt to include those \\nwho have apparent or potential asthma but remain unrecog -\\nnized and undiagnosed.62,63 In less developed countries, the \\nInternational Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood \\n(ISAAC) was successful in identifying those with potential \\nasthma, but providing the required follow-up evaluation and \\ncare was often beyond the ability and resources of the coun -\\nty’s health-care system.64 In the United States, school-based \\nasthma screening has not been found to be successful in iden -\\ntifying new cases; however, it was able to identify children \\nwhose asthma was out of control.

He \\nhad eczema, peanut allergy, and a strong family history \\nof asthma. He had been prescribed inhaled topical corti -\\ncosteroids, a reliever inhaler, an oral leukotriene receptor \\nantagonist (LTRA), and an injectable adrenaline device. He \\nhad been taught to use a spacer device with his pressurized \\nmetered-dose inhalers, but had not been using the corti -\\ncosteroid inhaler regularly in his last few years of life. His \\nrepeat prescription record showed that he had been issued \\nprescriptions for nine salbutamol inhalers and three beclo -\\nmetasone inhalers in the 12 months before he died. He had \\nnot regularly attended planned routine checks at the general \\npractictioner; he had, however, been seen in the local emer -\\ngency department (ED) on two occasions in the 2 months \\npreceding his death. The notes from these attendances indi -\\ncated he had presented with upper respiratory tract infec -\\ntions associated with wheezing. He had been treated with \\nantibiotics and nebulized salbutamol on the second occa -\\nsion. He was not seen by a doctor or nurse in follow-up after \\nthese episodes and there was no evidence in the record of \\nfollow-up arrangements made by either the hospital or his \\ngeneral practitioner after these episodes. His final, fatal \\nattack occurred when the family was away on a camping \\nholiday. He had been coughing and wheezing for two nights. \\nFor these last few days, he had needed to use his salbutamol inhaler every 3–4 h, and when he finally became very dis -\\ntressed and short of breath his parents called for an emer -\\ngency ambulance, which responded within 8 min.

As diagnosis and \\nmanagement of asthma is well covered in other chapters \\nof the book, the reader is directed to those for more detail. \\nThis chapter should assist primary health care professionals \\n(general practitioners and nurses) in reducing the incidence \\nof severe and fatal episodes of acute asthma. Furthermore, \\nChapter 14 provides a number of practical examples for \\nimproving both health-care delivery and adherence to medi -\\ncal advice, and complements many of the messages in this \\nchapter.\\nLESSONS FROM CONFIDENTIAL INQUIRIES \\nAND ASTHMA DEATH REVIEWS\\nA number of themes emerge from the confidential inquiries \\non asthma death. These include issues related to assessment, \\nchronic and acute management, and patient education.\\nassess Ment\\nFailure to assess asthma control routinely and to assess the \\nseverity of asthma exacerbations has been recognized for over \\n50 years.3,11 In the British Thoracic Association’s confidential \\ninquiry into 92 asthma deaths in 1979, the authors concluded \\nthat a possible explanation for the perception that many of \\nthe 92 cases they studied were precipitous or sudden occur -\\nrences was that patients, clinicians, and families had under -\\nestimated the underlying severity of asthma in these people.3 \\nIn fact, only 20% of deaths were sudden in the recent East \\nof England Confidential Inquiry.10 That the severity of fatal \\nattacks was not recognized by the majority of individuals con -\\ncerned3 indicates that patients and families may not have been \\ntaught to recognize danger signs, health professional may not \\nhave sought or recognized these factors, or maybe objective \\nmeasurements were not performed.8 The ongoing confiden -\\ntial enquiries in eastern England in the United Kingdom have \\nreported improvements in the use of objective assessment of asthma control, particularly lung function10,13,14; however, in \\ntheir latest report, nearly 20% of those who died had not had \\na recent peak flow assessment either in the primary or sec -\\nondary care setting. Sturdy et al.,9 in their large case control \\nstudy, noted that among those who died from asthma there \\nwere fewer general practice contacts in the previous year and \\nfewer peak expiratory flow recordings in the 3 months preced -\\ning their index attacks.\\nFollow-up and assessment of patients after an acute attack \\nare recommended by national and international guidelines \\nand yet failure to do this has been noted as a problem in past \\nand recent studies on asthma deaths.3,9,10\\nchron Ic Manage Ment\\nFollowing the early asthma death confidential inquiries3,11 \\nand an international task force meeting7 to discuss lessons \\nlearned from these studies, both national and international \\nguidelines and strategy documents were published in the \\nearly 1990s. Despite these developments, recent studies have \\ndemonstrated that implementation of asthma guidelines by \\nhealth professionals varies considerably.1 Inadequate pre -\\nscribing of preventer medication, particularly inhaled cor -\\nticosteroids, as well as underuse of systemic corticosteroids \\nin acute attacks has been a common observation in confi -\\ndential inquiries as well as in case control studies of severe \\nasthma attacks. The association between excess use of short-\\nacting beta2-adrenergic agonists (SABAs) and increased risk \\nof asthma death has been identified in a number of studies, \\none of the earliest being in 1994.15 Yet, excessive reliance \\non SABAs by both patients and health professionals per -\\nsists.8,10 In addition, studies demonstrate that health profes -\\nsionals seem to underprescribe inhaled corticosteroids for \\nprevention and systemic corticosteroids for acute asthma, \\nand fail to implement routine management and follow-\\nup.3,10,16,17 Surprisingly, incorrect drug treatment was noted \\nin one study where nearly 40% of the 20 children who died \\nfrom asthma attacks were prescribed long-acting beta-ago -\\nnists (LABAs) without concurrent inhaled corticosteroids.12 \\nOne pediatric study found that 18 out of 35 (51%) children \\nunder 16 who died from asthma had been chronically under -\\ntreated,16 while another reported inadequate assessment or \\ntherapy of asthma in 68% of 51 people under 20 years who \\ndied from asthma.17\\nFurthermore, studies have concluded that in many cases \\noverall care of people before their asthma deaths was below \\nexpected standards,10 and that specialist care was not sought, \\nor was delayed, in both primary and secondary care (the lat -\\nter while people were inpatients in hospital).10\\nOrganization of care provision has been implicated in \\npoor outcomes for people with asthma. Delayed access to \\ncare is one factor: a case control study comparing near-fatal \\nand fatal cases due to asthma concluded there was a delay in \\naccess to acute treatment in 28% of the 80 fatalities studied.18 \\nSecond, not having systems in place for follow-up of nonat -\\ntenders and failure to recognize poor prognostic risk factors \\nhave also been cited as causes for concern.10', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 318}),\n"," Document(page_content='301 Preventing Asthma Death\\nFailure to recognize poor prognostic risk factors of dying \\nfrom asthma and subsequently taking appropriate action to \\ngain and maintain control of the disease has been frequently \\nnoted in studies on asthma death.3,7,10,11\\npatIent educat Ion\\nWhile a number of studies report cases of nonadherence to \\nmedical advice by patients, a number also report delays in \\nseeking help during fatal attacks.3,8,18 This is possibly due to \\npoor adherence to treatment advice, but is more likely to be \\nrelated to lack of provision by health professionals or under -\\nuse of personal asthma action plans by patients (see Chapters \\n13 and 14). While primary care consultations are relatively \\nbrief, people are exposed to their health-care professional for \\na considerable period of time overall and each of these epi -\\nsodes presents an opportunity for education.\\nacute asthMa Manage Ment and \\nfollow -up In general  pract Ice\\nFailure to identify asthma exacerbations, to recognize the \\nseverity of uncontrolled or acute asthma, and to treat these \\npatients appropriately has been documented in studies on \\nasthma deaths. In particular, a lack of formal assessment \\nincluding medical history, symptoms and signs, and objec -\\ntive measurements of asthma control and lung function \\nhas been noted. Furthermore, confidential inquiries as well \\nas case control studies have concluded there were undue \\ndelays in receiving treatment for fatal attacks of asthma.9,18 \\nOver the last few decades, health professionals in primary \\ncare, for example in the United Kingdom, have seen a dra -\\nmatic increase of workload in terms of patient demand. \\nFurthermore, largely due to changes in funding structure, \\nmany sessional or part-time doctors are employed in primary \\ncare. As a result, patients experience significant delays in \\nobtaining appointments with their usual doctors, as well as a \\nconsequent loss in continuity of care. Finally, undertreatment \\nof acute asthma attacks, especially the failure to use systemic \\ncorticosteroids, has been a recurrent theme underlying the \\nconclusions of asthma death studies.3,7,10,11 Either these drugs \\nare not used at all or they are not used in adequate doses for \\na long enough duration.\\nPREVENTING ASTHMA DEATHS \\nIN PRIMARY CARE\\nAlthough the nature of general practice varies from coun -\\ntry to country, a number of opportunities for identifying \\nasthma patients at risk are evident in most settings. These \\narise during routine consultations, for conditions other than \\nasthma, where a few carefully planned questions can deter -\\nmine whether someone’s asthma is poorly controlled. For \\nexample, asking a few questions about the presence of respi -\\nratory symptoms in the day or night, and about limitation of \\nactivity, can lead to conclusions about the level of asthma \\ncontrol. Similarly, a quick perusal of medical records can assist in determining whether the patient is adhering to medi -\\ncal advice by collecting preventer prescriptions, attending at \\nappropriate intervals for routine review, or being prescribed \\nexcess reliever medication. Evidence of consultations with \\nother colleagues in the same practice, attendance of EDs, \\nor admissions to the hospital for asthma will also appear in \\nthe record. Accepting that they have an extremely difficult \\ntask, with limited time, to deal with all sorts of medical and \\nsocial problems, health professionals in primary care need \\nto try to move away from an approach that deals only with \\nthe patient’s presenting symptoms. By identifying patients at \\nrisk, in a dynamic ongoing manner, patients’ well-being can \\nbe improved while decreasing workload through reduction of \\nacute crises in the future.\\nopportun ItIes for Intervent Ion\\nThe advent of computerized record systems in primary \\ncare has been extremely positive in some respects, but, as is \\noften the case, the value of the system depends entirely on \\nthe quality of information entered by the human operator. \\nPrescribing has certainly been made safer, with alerts on past \\nallergies and potential drug interactions, and also through \\nmaintenance of a clear legible record of prescriptions issued. \\nHowever, medical record entries are often in the form of \\nshort coded items without much information describing the \\nunderlying rationale for clinical decisions. In essence, many \\nprimary care computerized record systems are simply used \\nas a repository for a sometimes very brief record, and the \\npower of using the data dynamically and interactively has not \\nyet been systematically harnessed in routine clinical practice.\\nPrimary care and pharmacy prescription records have \\nbeen used for years by funders, researchers, and advisers to \\nmanagement, although there is little evidence in the litera -\\nture that these records are integrated with those in primary \\ncare and used dynamically in assessing risk and identify -\\ning patients in need of optimization of care. With modern \\ncomputer systems it should be possible for software to flag \\ncertain issues during the consultation. For example, when \\nan asthmatic patient consults, a flag could alert the practitio -\\nner to the number of beta2-agonist bronchodilator prescrip -\\ntions issued in the last year. The system could also display \\nthe proportion of inhaled corticosteroid prescriptions to \\nSABAs and LABAs. In the absence of a computer system, a \\nmanual record could be organized to provide the same sort \\nof information. For example, a page in the record could be \\ndedicated to each repeat drug prescribed, perhaps a page \\nfor each SABA, and one for each inhaled corticosteroid pre -\\nscribed, numbered and dated so a quick glance will reveal \\nthose under- or overusing their drugs. These types of systems \\ncould alert the clinician, at the time the patient consults, that \\nfurther intervention may be needed. Suissa and colleagues15 \\nnoted many years ago that a pattern of increased use of \\nbeta2-agonist inhalers was associated with an increased risk \\nof having a life-threatening asthma attack, yet a high pro -\\nportion of children who died in the last decade from asthma \\nhad been prescribed excess SABAs.10 Ideally, there should ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 319}),\n"," Document(page_content='302 Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice\\nbe systems for integrating pharmacy records—for example, \\non dispensing or actual “pick-up rates” by patients collect -\\ning medication—with those in primary care (see Chapter\\xa014). \\nTherefore, by implementing systems for recognizing this \\npattern, general practitioners and pharmacists are uniquely \\nplaced to identify people in need of an urgent asthma evalu -\\nation. Another example from general practice is that many \\npatients are able to obtain refill prescriptions without seeing \\na doctor or nurse. A quick perusal of the prescribing his -\\ntory by the doctor, before signing one of these refills, could \\nhelp identify those who are receiving an excess of SABAs \\nor too few controller medications. These patients could be \\ninstructed to make an office appointment when coming to \\npick up their prescription. Furthermore, in keeping with pre -\\nscribing advice, those taking LABAs as monotherapy with -\\nout inhaled corticosteroids could also be identified and told \\nto make an office appointment immediately.\\nfocused  asthMa revIews: achIevIng \\nand MaIntaInIng control\\nAsthma reviews are usually done either as a planned routine \\nassessment or opportunistically when a patient consults for \\nsome other reason. The principles of these reviews have been \\nwell described in international and national guidelines and \\nshould include confirmation of the diagnosis, assessment of \\nasthma control, identification of risk factors particular to that \\npatient, checking of adherence, inhaler technique, optimiza -\\ntion of medication, and provision or updating of a personal \\nasthma action plan. All of these subjects are covered in detail \\nthroughout this book and some of the practical issues related \\nto primary care are discussed in this chapter.\\nOne of the major criticisms of primary care manage -\\nment of asthma relates to delay and accuracy of diagnosis. \\nConsidering that family doctors deal with a multitude of \\nmedical and social problems, it is not surprising that these \\nissues exist. The nature of general practice where patients \\nmay consult a number of different health professionals from \\ndifferent disciplines at various times results in delayed \\ndiagnosis and lack of continuity of care, resulting in vari -\\nable consistency of advice or treatment. This is further \\ncompounded by ever-changing demands on these health \\nprofessionals by governments and local funding bodies, \\ncoupled with an ever-increasing paper mountain of guide -\\nlines and cost-cutting directives covering the vast range \\nof disease areas dealt with by these doctors and nurses. \\nNonetheless, efficient systems do need to be in place to \\nensure high-quality, safe care of patients, which begins with \\nestablishing an accurate diagnosis. Previously, we demon -\\nstrated the extraordinary delays that can occur in diagnos -\\ning asthma in general practice19,20 and recommended a few \\npossible solutions.21 These included searching through past \\nrecords for clues to the patient’s atopic status such as allergic \\nrhinitis and asthma, as well as a record of prescriptions for \\ninhalers whenever an undiagnosed patient consulted with \\nrespiratory symptoms. In this way, the “reflex” prescription \\nissue of an antibiotic for presumed acute infection rather than a chronic underlying disease may be resisted. By accu -\\nrately recording the medical history as well as the rationale \\nfor a final diagnosis in the office notes, in the form of a sum -\\nmary or problem-orientated system, future management \\nshould improve. If this is done well, health professionals \\ncan utilize the records as a valuable resource in deciding on \\nmanagement when patients consult. Furthermore, as many \\nresearch studies recruit patients from primary care on the \\nbasis of “physician-diagnosed asthma,” it is important to \\naccurately record the subjective and objective criteria in \\nsupport of this diagnosis.\\nSome have suggested setting up asthma “at-risk registers” \\nin primary care. The justification for this would be to pri -\\noritize those patients at risk for severe asthma and to reduce \\nworkload. This would result in a list of patients that should \\nbe more closely monitored and more aggressively treated \\nin the outpatient setting. However, this argument is flawed \\nin a number of ways, particularly since asthma control is a \\ndynamic process and therefore a classification of an asthma \\nsufferer as “at risk” is only valid on the day of assessment. \\nSince asthma may change status from day to day, it is pos -\\nsible for someone to be well controlled one day, and admit -\\nted to an intensive care unit for an acute severe attack on \\nanother. Therefore, unless there is a dynamic system for \\nupdating patients’ risk status it may be very dangerous to \\nput some on a register. While it would be a good idea to \\nknow about those people with brittle asthma and those that \\nare under the care of specialists for true severe asthma, it is \\nanother matter to create a general asthma at-risk register. \\nThere is obviously concern that those not on the “at-risk” \\nregisters may get substandard care.10,22 It could be said that \\nall asthmatic people are potentially at risk, given that up to \\n50% of people who die from asthma and a high proportion \\nof those who have severe attacks are deemed to have had \\n“mild asthma”.12,23,24 In addition to recalling and assessing \\nthose patients after they have been treated for acute attacks, \\nsystems should be in place to opportunistically identify \\npoorly controlled asthmatics.\\nTherefore, a dynamic process of assessment is needed \\nwhen determining the risks to individuals with asthma. \\nThe GINA Strategy document25 was one of the first to \\nfocus on assessment of asthma control and risks, with the \\naim of achieving and maintaining control to prevent asthma \\nattacks. This hypothesis was confirmed in a number of stud -\\nies. Bateman et al.26 demonstrated a six-fold increased risk of \\nfuture asthma exacerbations in people with poorly controlled \\nasthma using the GINA Control Tool. Wei et al. showed that \\nboth partly and poorly controlled patients (using the Asthma \\nControl Test) were at risk of having future asthma exacerba -\\ntions as well as unplanned and emergency visits.27 Therefore \\nit seems sensible to assess asthma control at every opportu -\\nnity in the primary care setting.\\nThere is some confusion between the terms “control” \\nand “severity” when classifying asthma patients, which may \\nresult in inconsistent care provided for those with this disease, \\nincluding their current need for treatment and frequency of \\nroutine office visit follow-ups. Essentially, chronic severity of ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Clinical Asthma.pdf', 'page': 320}),\n"," Document(page_content='303 Preventing Asthma Death\\nasthma relates to the amount of treatment required to achieve \\nsymptom control, whereas acute severity is determined by \\nthe presence of symptoms, signs, and physiological indi -\\nces.25,28,29 Humbert et al.30 described very clearly the ratio -\\nnale against using “chronic severity” of asthma as a basis for \\nclinical decisions; this is not a static phenomenon and there \\nwas limited evidence that severity was of value in predict -\\ning the effects of long-term outcomes from treatment. In fact, \\nthey recommended periodic assessment of asthma control as \\nmore relevant and useful.\\nThere are a number of methods available for assessment \\nof asthma control that include evaluation of symptoms, the \\neffect of the person’s asthma on their lifestyle, their use of \\nrescue medication, and lung function measurement. Despite \\nthe existence of a number of instruments and tools, includ -\\ning the Asthma Control Test,31 the GINA Control Tool,25 the \\nRoyal College of Physicians “3 Questions”,32 and the Asthma \\nControl Questionnaire (ACQ),33 this assessment is not often \\ndone routinely in primary care.\\nIt is not enough to assess asthma control. Having deter -\\nmined that a person’s asthma is poorly controlled, it is \\nclearly incumbent upon the clinician to then ascertain the \\npossible reason(s) for this and to take appropriate action to \\ngain control. This would include an assessment of adher -\\nence to medication and inhaler technique. As described \\nabove, the former is fairly straightforward to establish in \\nprimary care by simply counting the number of prescrip -\\ntions issued for SABAs and preventer medication. Thus, \\nproviding some information on asthma control (prescrip -\\ntion of more than four to six SABA inhalers a year indi -\\ncates possible poor control) and the proportion of inhaled \\ncorticosteroid to SABA prescriptions acts as a surrogate \\nmeasure for both the clinician’s and the patient’s adherence \\nto asthma guidelines. Clearly, patients using excess SABAs \\nshould be prescribed a preventer medication. Similarly, \\nsomeone who has had prescriptions for short courses of \\nsystemic corticosteroids is possibly at risk for further exac -\\nerbations. Of course, while this will establish the number \\nof prescriptions issued, it will not determine whether the \\nmedication has been dispensed by a pharmacist or has actu -\\nally been taken by the person.\\nPatients unable to use their inhalers (particularly pres -\\nsurized metered-dose inhalers) should be either taught to do \\nso or prescribed an alternative device.34,35 This could be in \\nthe form of a completely different device or the addition of a \\nspacer inhaler. There is mounting evidence that asthma con -\\ntrol is adversely affected by poor inhaler technique and there -\\nfore it is vital to ensure that patients can take their medication \\nproperly.36\\nrecogn IzIng and Manag Ing asthMa \\nattac Ks In prIMary care\\nDiagnosis of asthma in general practice requires initial rec -\\nognition and confirmation of the disease, recognition and \\ndiagnosis of uncontrolled episodes of asthma, and assessment \\nof the severity of these exacerbations. General practitioners manage a large variety of conditions in patients presenting \\nto their offices, and it can be sometimes very challenging \\nto identify those developing an asthma exacerbation. While \\nthe management of acute asthma exacerbations is detailed \\nelsewhere in this book, the key challenge for the health pro -\\nfessional in primary care is to diagnose an asthma attack or \\nexacerbation in a very busy general clinic where most ail -\\nments are relatively minor. Therefore, maintaining a high \\nindex of suspicion for an impending asthma attack in any \\npatient presenting with respiratory symptoms, regardless \\nof whether or not they had been previously diagnosed with \\nasthma, is essential. While the symptoms may be sudden \\nand associated with overt wheezing, an asthma exacerbation \\nin many patients may be insidious without overt clues to an \\nimpending attack. For example, a child who presents with a \\nhistory from the mother of severe wheezing and coughing \\nduring the night may look perfectly well with a clear chest \\nexamination. However, the current situation may simply be \\ndue to the effect of a high-dose bronchodilator or oral cor -\\nticosteroids administered during the night if the mother \\nhas followed the asthma action plan previously provided. It \\nwould be a mistake to send that child home without appropri -\\nate advice or management. Similarly it would be a mistake \\nnot to take seriously a patient’s history of using an excessive \\namount of short-acting bronchodilator prior to their office \\nvisit for respiratory symptoms. A primary care physician, \\ntherefore, needs to be very familiar with the natural history \\nand management of asthma exacerbations in order to prevent \\nthe development of severe attacks. Clues to developing asthma \\nattacks in primary care need to be detected through a very \\ncareful history including a history of reduced effectiveness of \\nreliever drugs; ongoing nighttime symptoms; ongoing respi -\\nratory symptoms following a virus infection; and increased \\nvariability of peak flow measurements. In those patients with \\nallergic rhinitis, increased symptoms on exposure to indoor \\nor outdoor allergic and nonallergic triggers could herald an \\nasthma exacerbation. Furthermore, an exacerbation could be \\nprecipitated on exposure to a variety of environmental trig -\\ngers in poorly controlled asthma. Therefore, someone with \\npoorly controlled asthma consulting with respiratory symp -\\ntoms should be treated fairly rigorously. Depending on their \\nreported triggers, consideration should be given for allergy \\nconsultation.\\nThe severity of the attack can be determined using the \\nsuggested tables from international25 or local guidelines \\nbased on history, examination, oxygen saturation, and vital \\nsigns. It is helpful to have a reference copy of these tables in \\neach consulting room. Establishing asthma severity helps the \\ndetermination whether it is necessary to transfer the patient \\nto secondary care. Clearly someone with an acute severe or \\nlife-threatening attack should be transferred to an appropri -\\nate facility as soon as possible. In other cases, a system for \\nongoing assessment during treatment is helpful, to facilitate \\ndecisions on management as the situation progresses. The \\nauthor uses a timed chart detailing vital signs, peak expira -\\ntory flow, oxygen saturation, and oxygen flow rates (http://\\nwww.consultmarklevy.com/academic_services/other.php).

This is \\nhelpful because many general practitioners have had the \\nexperience of sending a patient with acute asthma attack to \\nthe hospital after initial treatment, only to find the patient \\nhas been discharged home after a short 4 h time span while \\nthe acute drugs are still exhibiting an effect. These patients \\noften need to be readmitted. Treatment would include high-\\ndose bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and oxygen. \\nIn those patients not admitted to hospital, in addition to a \\nhome supply of oral corticosteroids, optimization of treat -\\nment, and checking inhaler technique, providing a peak flow \\nmeter and diary to enable the patient to monitor progress \\nuntil the episode has resolved is very beneficial. In this way \\nan informed decision can be made as to when it may be safe \\nto discontinue oral corticosteroids. Follow-up appointments \\nto ensure that the patient is adhering to agreed medical man -\\nagement plans are essential. It is important to communicate \\nthe need for more frequent office visits until asthma control \\ncan be established.\\nfollow -up after attac Ks treated  \\nIn prIMary or secondary  care\\nEvery patient should be seen by their physician within a few \\ndays after an asthma exacerbation. This applies to all exac -\\nerbations whether they occur in a primary or secondary care \\nsetting, or even where patients have self-treated an attack \\naccording to a previously agreed self-management action \\nplan. This is often not done, as evidenced by the numer -\\nous studies on near-fatal attacks and in confidential inqui -\\nries on asthma deaths where the individuals had suffered \\na previous attack. The review is an opportunity not only to \\nmonitor the person’s progress toward satisfactory recovery \\nto optimize treatment, but also to try to identify barriers to \\nadherence and where things may have gone wrong. Asking \\nfor and reviewing a peak flow chart helps to reinforce adher -\\nent behavior in future. Questions to consider asking include: \\nWhen did the symptoms start? How bad were they? Was \\nthere any response to self-treatment? Did the person have \\nand follow an action plan? Did they try and get an appoint -\\nment to see the general practitioner or asthma nurse? What \\nhappened? Were they seen in an ED or urgent care center? \\n(See Chapter 14 for examples of improving both understand -\\ning and improvement of adherence through mutual agree -\\nment between the patient and health professional, to reduce \\nfuture asthma attacks.)\\nEssentially, by conducting a thorough review after initial \\ntreatment, both the health professional and the patient can \\nlearn from this experience how to prevent future attacks.\\nCONCLUSION\\nLessons learned from the circumstances surrounding the \\ntragic avoidable deaths due directly or indirectly to poorly \\ncontrolled asthma provide an extremely rich source of educational information to guide health professionals as well \\nas patients and their families through proper asthma man -\\nagement. Case reviews, medical audit,37 and participation in \\nconfidential inquiries following an acute attack or asthma \\ndeath provide a method for learning from our patients and \\nimproving asthma care overall.\\nREFERENCES\\n 1.

Consequently, the scienti/f_ic literature has grown vast and can be dif/f_icult \\nto integrate. With contributions from a distinguished panel of world-renowned authors, Clinical Asthma: Theory and Practice presents a comprehensive study of both the common and the more challenging problems faced by all health care \\npersonnel who treat patients with asthma. \\nThe book is divided into seven sections, starting with the basics of asthma and \\nending with a discussion on the approach to asthma worldwide and in the primary care setting. Re/f_lecting a strong clinical emphasis, each chapter begins with a patient case study supported by essential background information on the basic science and clinical decision-making process. This is followed by a discussion of clinical evaluation and management. \\nThe multidisciplinary coverage explores a range of topics including genetics, \\nin/f_lammation, immunology, and the identi/f_ication of different endotypes. Using a bench-to-bedside approach, the book links basic science to the clinical manage-ment of asthma and explores options for improvement.

This allowed us to produce a text that found a unique niche between the more heavily referenced books and the more superficial guides. In this edition, the reader was introduced to the individual cells and mediators that participate in the allergic response and this information was then built on to describe the histopathological features, diagnoses and treatment of allergic responses occurring in all major organs.\\nWhen preparing the second edition, we took note of the feedback of many \\nclinicians who asked us if we could put primary emphasis on the clinical mani -\\nfestations of allergy and augment this with a solid scientific background. We kept this format for the third edition. This format has appeared to be very successful with our readers, so much so that it was awarded ‘Book of the Year’ prize by the British Medical Association.\\nNow, 19 years after the original Allergy we are at the fourth edition with two \\nnew editors. Dr Lawrence Lichtenstein has retired and we welcome Dr David Broide and Dr Fernando Martinez to the editorial team. We have also updated the format slightly by emphasising the clinical aspects while reducing the cellular science to a single chapter introducing mechanisms of allergic disease. Further -\\nmore, two new chapters have been added, one on eosinophilia, including eosi -\\nnophilic oesophagitis and the other on systemic mastocytosis.\\nOne thing that has not changed is our policy of inviting international authorities, \\noften two or more authors from different countries, to work together to produce their sections. Although this approach is not without its logistical problems, we believe it has produced a more authoritative text and we thank all the authors for their forbearance. Indeed, we owe a great debt of gratitude to the many experts who have contributed such informative chapters.\\nAs readers, we hope that you will appreciate the fourth edition of Allergy and \\nthat you find its content enjoyable and educative to read. As we requested in the first three editions, please give us your feedback on the book so that we can refine it even further in the future.\\nSTH, MKC, DHB, FDM 2012preface', metadata={'source':

The key components of a well-functioning immune system include the ability to generate both innate and adaptive immune responses (Fig. 1.1). The innate immune system comprises cellular elements that are both resident in tissues (i.e. epithelium, macro -\\nphages, mast cells) for a rapid response and circulating leukocytes that are recruited from the blood stream (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, mono-nuclear cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and NK T cells). In addition to the cellular response the innate immune system has humoral elements (comple -\\nment, antimicrobial peptides, mannose-binding lectin), which provides a mechanism for an immediate response to infection that is not antigen specific and does not have immunological memory. In contrast, the adaptive immune response generated by its component T and B cells is slower to respond to infections (taking days) but has the advantage of exhibiting antigen specificity and immunological memory. A malfunctioning immune system may lead not only to immunodeficiency with recurrent infections, but also to autoimmu -\\nnity and allergic diseases. In this chapter, we focus on the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which an aberrant immune response to low levels of otherwise innocuous and ubiquitous environmental exposures such as airborne grass pollens or ingested foods may trigger a range of allergic responses from chronic symptoms affecting quality of life to acute severe allergic reactions that are life threatening.\\nOverview of the allergic immune response\\nAllergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, and food allergy are char -\\nacterized by the ability to make an IgE antibody response to an environmental allergen. There is both a strong genetic (see Ch. 2) as well as environmental contribution to the development of allergic disease (see Chs 3 and 4). Immu -\\nnoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic responses most frequently occur on mucosal (nose, conjunctiva, airway, gastrointestinal tract) or skin surfaces as these anatomical sites contain high levels of mast cells to which IgE is affixed.

In this chapter we explore these mech -\\nanisms in greater detail to gain insight into the cellular \\nand molecular events that contribute to the development of the allergic inflammatory response. Such important insights provide the rationale for the development of novel therapies for the targeted treatment of allergic disease, as well as the potential development of biomark -\\ners to assess allergic disease severity, progression, or response to therapy.\\nCentral role of IgE and  \\nmast cells\\nAtopy, the tendency to produce IgE antibodies specific for environmental allergens, affects 30–40% of the popu -\\nlation of developed nations. The production of IgE results in a range of hypersensitivity disorders including, anaphy -\\nlaxis, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and asthma. IgE antibodies, IgE receptors, and several lineages of effector cells activated by IgE have persisted through vertebrate evolution implicating this antibody isotype in important physiological immune functions. IgE probably serves to eliminate helminthic parasites during primary infection and in parasite endemic regions to protect previously Initial exposure of a genetically predisposed individual to low levels of allergens such as grass pollens results in uptake of the pollen allergen by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), intracellular digestion of the allergen into peptide fragments, and display of the allergen peptide fragments in an human leukocyte antigen (HLA) groove on the APC surface (Fig. 1.2). When circulating T cells (expressing an antigen cell surface receptor specific for the allergen peptide) interact with the APC, the interaction activates the T cell to express cytokines characterized by a helper T cell type 2 (Th2) cytokine profile ( Fig. 1.3 ). Th2 \\ncytokines (T able 1.1) play an important role in inducing B cells to switch class and express IgE (e.g. interleukin-4, IL-4), induce eosinophil proliferation in the bone marrow (i.e. induced by IL-5), and up-regulate adhesion mole -\\ncules on blood vessels to promote tissue infiltration of circulating inflammatory cells associated with allergic inflammation such as eosinophils and basophils. The aller -\\ngen specific IgE (induced by initial exposure to allergen) binds to high-affinity IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils. These IgE sensitized mast cells upon re-exposure to specific allergen are activated to release histamine and many other proinflammatory mediators that contribute to the allergic inflammatory response ( Fig. 1.4). Although \\nthis induction of a Th2 response is characteristic of aller -\\ngic inflammation, it is increasingly evident that additional Fig. 1.1  Innate and adaptive immune response. The human microbial defence system can be simplistically viewed as \\nconsisting of three levels: (1) anatomical and physiological barriers; (2) innate immunity; and (3) adaptive immunity. In \\ncommon with many classification systems, some elements are difficult to categorize. For example, NK T cells and dendritic cells could be classified as being on the cusp of innate and adaptive immunity rather than being firmly in one camp.

In recent years, IgE blockade using the monoclonal antibody omalizumab has been introduced as an important new therapeutic option. As IgE plays a central role in allergic inflammation, it is important to understand the structural properties of IgE antibodies, the organization of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus and the cellular and molecular events regulat -\\ning IgE production by B cells.\\nIgE structure\\nHardly a day passes when a practising allergist does not employ skin testing or in vitro diagnostic techniques to detect IgE antibodies. Establishing the presence of IgE specific for environmental aeroallergens, food antigens, and insect venom components is the cornerstone of aller -\\ngic diagnosis. In this light it may seem surprising from a historical perspective that the IgE antibody isotype was the last one identified, discovered only in the 1960s, decades after IgM, IgD, IgG, and IgA. Biochemical char -\\nacterization of the reaginic fraction of serum, the activity \\ncapable of passively transferring cutaneous sensitivity from an allergic donor to the skin of a non-allergic recipi -\\nent (Prausnitz–Küstner reaction), along with the serologi-cal classification of some unusual myeloma antibodies established the existence of a novel isotype that was heat labile, failed to fix complement, did not cross the pla -\\ncenta and did not give antibody  :  antigen precipitates (pre -\\ncipitin lines) in immunodiffusion assays. This apparently novel isotype resided in the γ-globulin fraction of serum \\nand was identified as IgE by investigators in Japan, Sweden, and England.\\nIgE remained elusive for so long primarily because of \\nits very low plasma concentrations and short half-life compared with other immunoglobulin isotypes. Whereas IgG antibodies are typically present at levels >\\n500 mg/\\ndL, IgE normally circulates at logs lower concentration even in atopic individuals with a normal range of <\\n0.2 mg/\\ndL. Although its presence in the circulation is transient, with a half-life of only about 2 days, considerably shorter than that of IgG (3 weeks), IgE is quite stable when bound to tissue mast cells where it may persist for months. This has important clinical implications. T rans -\\nplantation of solid organs harboring IgE-coated mast cells from donors with allergy to food or drugs can confer sensitivity for systemic anaphylaxis to previously allergen-tolerant recipients.\\nIgE shares its basic structural features with other \\nimmunoglobulin isotypes. It consists of two heavy chains (the ε-chains) and two light chains ( κ or λ) assembled \\ninto a tetrameric structure ( Fig. 1.5). The heavy chains \\nare composed of five immunoglobulin domains, a shared structural motif of many proteins with immunological Fig. 1.2  Antigen uptake.

Isotype switching greatly \\nenhances the range of effector functions of the antibody response by producing antibodies in which the immu -\\nnoglobulin heavy chains express the same V region (hence retaining the originally committed antibody specificity of the B-cell clone) but now in association with a new set of C\\nH domains, resulting in production of a new isotype. \\nAt the molecular genetic level, immunoglobulin isotype switching is mediated by deletional class switch recom-bination, a process that, like the VDJ recombination involved in B-cell development, involves irreversible somatic gene rearrangements.\\nIsotype switching in B cells is tightly regulated by both \\ncytokine signals and the interaction of accessory cell surface molecules. In the case of IgE, the combined effects of signals provided by IL-4 and/or IL-13 secreted by activated T cells and by CD40 ligand (CD154) expressed on the surface of those same helper T cells sets this process in motion. Both the cytokine and accessory signals are necessary to efficiently drive switching. Expo -\\nsure to these stimuli triggers an ordered cascade of events in the nucleus of the responding B cell in which targeted activation of transcription at specific regions in the IgH locus leads to DNA breaks, followed by repair resulting ultimately in the juxtaposition of the VDJ cassette with the appropriate CH exons.\\nThe immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus spans \\nover 1000  kb of genome on chromosome 14q32.33, \\nbeginning with the V , D, and J exons, followed by the C µ \\nand Cδ exon clusters and then by groups of CH exons encoding each of the other Ig heavy chain isotypes (see Fig. 1.8). The earliest detectable event in a cytokine-stimulated B cell initiating the process IgE isotype switch -\\ning is the generation of germline mRNA transcripts. IL-4 and IL-13 trigger STAT-6-driven germline transcription at the Cε locus (Fig. 1.10). In its germline configuration, the Cε locus contains not only the four C ε exons encoding \\nthe ε-heavy-chain constant region domains but also an \\nIL-4 responsive promoter (harbouring response elements for STAT-6), an I ε exon, a switch recombination region \\n(Sε), and, downstream of C ε1-4, M sequences encoding \\nthe transmembrane form of IgE. Although the transcripts that arise in this process do not encode functional protein (the Iε codon present at the 5 ′ end of these mRNAs \\nactually contains stop codons), the process of transcrip -\\ntion is nevertheless critical for the initiation of switch recombination.\\nT ranscription initiated at the ε-promoter results in \\nrecruitment of the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which is induced by CD40L signalling, to the ε–locus. AID functions to deaminate deoxycyti -\\ndine residues in the C-rich S ε region to deoxyuracils. \\nThese, in turn, are substrates for another enzyme, uracil DNA-glycosylase (UNG), which acts to introduce  \\nsingle-stranded DNA nicks within S ε. High-density Fig. 1.9  V–D–J recombination. Assembly of a highly diverse \\nrepertoire of heavy chain variable regions is mediated by a \\nprocess of somatic DNA rearrangement occuring during B-cell development in the bone marrow. V\\nH, D H, and J H \\nsegments are randomly selected and annealed. Combinatorial diversity is provided by the random \\nassortment of V , D, and J elements while additional \\nvariability is introduced by imprecision in joining (junctional diversity) and by the introduction of extra junctional nucleotides. This random and plastic process of somatic \\nDNA rearrangment leads to a far greater variety of V\\nH \\nsequences than could ever be separately encoded in the \\ngermline genome. VH DH\\nVDJJH\\nrecombination results in the assembly of an intact V H \\nexon just upstream of the C µ exons.

Help is \\nprovided both in the form of secreted cytokines and by the interaction of cell surface molecules during direct cell–cell contact (Fig. 1.12). Antigenic peptides displayed on the B-cell surface, bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, engage the T-cell receptor of Th cells of the same antigenic specificity (a cognate interaction) leading both to cytokine transcrip -\\ntion (including IL-4) and to expression of CD40L (CD154), an activation molecule not present on resting Th cells. CD40L in turn engages CD40 back on the B-cell surface, where CD40 is constitutively expressed, provid-ing a stimulus that, in concert with IL-4, induces ε-germline transcription and AID expression, setting into motion the molecular machinery of immunoglobulin class switch recombination to IgE. CD40–CD40L engagement also drives the expression of B7-family accessory mole -\\ncules on the B-cell surface that bind to receptors on the T-cell surface to amplify the cytokine signal further. This tightly choreographed sequence ensures the delivery of antigen-specific help for class switching.\\nT argeting transcription and consequent immunoglobu -\\nlin switching to the ε-locus require that the cytokine \\nsignal be in the form of IL-4, which is provided by the \\nFig. 1.12  T -cell help in IgE switching.

This interaction drives expression of both CD40L (CD154) on the T-cell \\nsurface and cytokines, including IL-4.

Among the signalling molecules recruited to this complex is phospholipase-C γ (PLCγ), \\nwhich hydrolyses membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) to generate inositol 1,4,5-  \\ntrisphosphate (PIP\\n2) and diacylglycerol (DAG).

This rise \\nin Ca2+ is a critical trigger for mast cell degranulation. \\nActivation of protein kinase C (PKC) by both DAG and increased Ca\\n2+ leads to signalling events driving mast cell \\ngene activation. In addition to the PLC γ pathway, several \\nparallel cascades of signalling events including the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and cytoskeletal (WASP) pathways are set into motion by Fc εRI aggregation, all \\nconverging to regulate mast cell degranulation and gene expression. Cell surface levels of Fc εRI are regulated by overlapping roles. It is known that activated mast cells produce IL-4. As these cells reside in the skin and mucosal tissues, sites of initial allergen encounters, and since they can be activated by non-specific stimuli, it is possible that mast-cell-derived IL-4 could start the cascade towards Th2 expansion. Recently basophils, which like mast cells express surface Fc εRI and are important sources of medi -\\nators of immediate hypersensitivity but, unlike mast cells, do not express the surface receptor c-kit, have been iden-tified as Th2 inducers. Basophils constitutively produce large amounts of IL-4 and their depletion in animal models of allergic disease has been shown to result in attenuation of Th2 responses.

Alter -\\nnatively, CD23 is known to bind the B-cell surface antigen CD21 (the receptor for Epstein–Barr virus, EBV), and the interaction of soluble CD23 with CD21 might exert its IgE-inducing effect.\\nThe immune response in allergy\\nDendritic cells\\nDendritic cells in the skin and mucous membranes perform a unique sentinel role in that they recognize antigens through their expression of pattern recognition receptors [e.g. T oll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors] that recognize motifs on virtually any pathogenic organism, allergen, or antigen. Dendritic cells (DC) can also sense tissue damage through receptors for inflammatory mediators (e.g. damage-associated molecular patterns like uric acid, high-mobility group box 1) allowing them to serve as a bridge between innate and adaptive immune responses. DCs arising from a CD34+ precursor in the bone marrow further differen -\\ntiate under the influence of various cytokines into subsets including myeloid DC (e.g. Langerhans cell, inflamma -\\ntory dendritic epidermal cell) and plasmacytoid DC, which express specific markers. A unique feature of DCs is their typical morphology with long dendrite-like exten-sions that express high levels of MHC to present antigen (Fig. 1.16 ).\\nAllergens are taken up by DCs and this plays a very \\nimportant role in the subsequent immune response. Allergens can also activate DCs through indirect mecha -\\nnisms involving cells such as epithelium. For example, house dust mite allergen can activate epithelial cells through several epithelial-expressed receptors (TLR, C-type lectin, protease-activated receptor 2), which leads to the release from epithelial cells of innate cytokines [thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-25, IL-33] that programme dendritic cells to become Th2 inducers.Fig. 1.16  Dendritic cell networks in the respiratory tract. \\n(a) Airway dendritic cells (rat) stained for major \\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) II (normal healthy airway epithelium, tangential section; (b) MHC II+ dendritic cells in \\nrat alveolar septal wall. \\na\\nb\\nOf particular importance to allergic inflammation,  \\ndendritic cells express the high-affinity IgE receptor that \\ncan mediate allergen presentation to T cells.

The presence of \\nallergen-specific IgE bound to the high-affinity IgE recep -\\ntor on dendritic cells can lead to a 100-fold lowering of the threshold dose for allergen recognition by Th2 cells. Once activated, dendritic cells migrate to regional lymph nodes where they present the processed antigen to T cells. Following allergen challenge, dendritic cells are a prominent source of the Th2-cell-attracting chemokines TARC (CCL17) and MDC (CCL22). Thus, dendritic cells not only present allergen to activate T cells but also play an important role in Th2-cell recruitment to sites of allergic inflammation.\\nEffector T-cell subsets\\nNaïve CD4+ cells can differentiate into Th1, Th2, Th9, or Th17 effector cells based on microenvironmental stimuli to which they are exposed in the presence of ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n"," Document(page_content='Introduction to mechanisms of allergic disease1\\n12\\nantigen.

Whereas Th1/Th2 polarization is \\nclear-cut in murine models, the situation is not as clear-cut for human T-cell subsets, which can secrete a mixed pattern of cytokines. Thus, Th1 and Th2 cells are not two distinct CD4+ T-cell subsets, but rather represent polar -\\nized forms of the highly heterogenous CD4 + Th-cell-\\nmediated immune response. Additional T-cell populations including Th17 and Th9 cells have been identified under -\\nscoring the limitation of a pure Th1 vs Th2 paradigm of immune responses ( Fig. 1.18). With these caveats in \\nmind, Th1 cells nevertheless play a prominent role in cellular immunity by expressing cytokines that promote the development of cytotoxic T cells and macrophages [e.g. IFN-γ, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α)], \\nwhile Th2 cells regulate IgE synthesis (IL-4), eosinophil proliferation (IL-5), mast cell proliferation (IL-9), and airway hyperreactivity (IL-13). A Th2 pattern of cytokine expression is noted in allergic inflammation and in para-sitic infections, conditions both associated with IgE  \\nproduction and eosinophilia.

More recently, a novel Th9 cell \\npopulation that differs from Th2 cells has been described that does not express any well-defined transcription factors such as GATA-3, T-bet, ROR γt or Foxp3, empha -\\nsizing that Th9 cells are different from Th2, Th1, Th17, and T reg populations (see Fig. 1.18). It is currently \\nunknown whether, during the allergic response in vivo, IL-9-secreting T cells are distinct from Th2 cells or whether Th2 cells can be reprogrammed into Th9 cells.\\nTh17 cells\\nTh17 cells are associated with neutrophil-mediated inflammation and have therefore been studied in diseases associated with neutrophils including bacterial infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis. Since the discovery of IL-17, several other homologous proteins have been identified, resulting in a six-member IL-17 cytokine family in which the members are designated as IL-17A through IL-17F. The IL-17 family members IL-17A and IL-17F share the greatest \\nhomology and are perhaps the best-characterized \\ncytokines in the family.

Epithelial cells are activated by the early response cytokines including IL-1β and TNF-α. In response to these stimuli, epithelial cells generate chem -\\nokines, cytokines, and autacoid mediators, which promote the allergic response ( Fig. 1.20). In particular, epithelial \\nproducts have powerful chemoattractant activity for eosi -\\nnophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. The epithelium is a major source of eosinophil chemoattract -\\nants (including eotaxin-1, RANTES, and monocyte chemotactic peptide-4), as well as CD4+ T memory lym-phocyte chemoattractants (RANTES, MCP-1, and IL-16).\\nTSLP, IL-25, IL-33\\nThe cytokines thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-25, and IL-33 have been recognized to play an impor -\\ntant role in initiating, amplifying, and maintaining Th2 responses important to allergic inflammation (see Fig. \\n1.20).\\nTSLP\\nIncreased levels of TSLP have been noted in skin biopsies from subjects with atopic dermatitis as well as in the airways of subjects with asthma. The increased levels of TSLP in the airway in asthma correlate with disease severity. TSLP is derived from epithelial cell and non-epithelial cell sources and acts on dendritic cells to up-regulate the co-stimulatory molecule OX40 ligand and hence favours Th2 responses.\\nIL-25\\nIL-25 (also known as IL-17E) is a member of the IL-17 cytokine family. Increased levels of IL-25 have been detected in asthma and atopic dermatitis. Studies in mouse models of asthma suggest that IL-25 may play an important role in promoting or sustaining an ongoing Th2 immune response.

In addition certain allergens such as house dust mite also have protease activity that can increase epithelial cell \\npermeability to enhance allergen penetration of the \\nmucosa, as well as activate protease receptors on epithe -\\nlial cells to release cytokines that promote Th2 cytokine responses. Although allergens are mostly large glycopro -\\nteins, there does not appear to be a common amino acid structure that confers the ability of a protein to initiate allergic disease. Occupational allergens also share no common structural features and are represented by a wide variety of low- and high-molecular weight com -\\npounds, including metal anhydrides, amines, wood dusts, metals, organic chemicals, animal and plant proteins, and biological enzymes. Platinum salts and low-molecular-weight acid anhydrides can interact with mast cells by acting as haptens and are recognized by IgE only after conjugation with a protein.\\nMast cells\\nMast cells play a pivotal role in the initiation of the  \\nIgE-mediated allergic response to allergen exposure on mucosal surfaces.

In addition, both IL-25 and IL-33 induce TSLP production from epithelial cells suggesting a potential mechanism by which these three cytokines interact and potentiate their function at mucosal surfaces.\\nEosinophils\\nThe allergic inflammatory response is characterized by the presence of increased numbers of eosinophils in the bone marrow, blood, and tissues.

In asthma, anti-IL-5 reduces exacerbations in asthmatics who have elevated levels of eosinophils in sputum but does not influence symptoms or airway hyperreactivity in asthmatics who are not recruited for clinical studies based on sputum eosinophil levels. In addition anti-IL-5 reduces levels of extracellular matrix remodelling in mild asthmatics. This reduction in remod -\\nelling is associated with reduced numbers of eosinophils and reduced expression of the pro fibrotic growth factor TGF-β1 by eosinophils in the airway.\\nNeutrophils\\nTissue neutrophilia is the hallmark of inflammation induced by bacterial infection. Allergen challenge induces a more prominent influx of eosinophils than neutrophils. Increased numbers of neutrophils can be detected in asthma exacerbations and in subjects with severe asthma as well as in subjects who die suddenly of asthma. The increased numbers of neutrophils in these more severe asthma populations may be related to infections, the use of corticosteroids that inhibit neutrophil apoptosis, or the active recruitment of neutrophils in severe asthma. Increased levels of the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 and Th17 cells have also been detected in severe asthma. Neutrophils have the ability to generate a variety of proinflammatory mediators including enzymes, oxygen radicals as well as lipid mediators and cytokines that attract and activate more neutrophils ( Fig. 1.22). At \\npresent it is not known whether the neutrophil contrib -\\nutes to airway responsivenes in asthma. The development of selective inhibitors of neutrophils (i.e. targeting IL-8 or the IL-8 receptor) will allow further study of the effect of selectively depleting neutrophils on the development of subsequent asthma or allergic inflammatory responses.\\nMacrophages\\nMacrophages are an important component of the innate immune system and clear organisms through their hyperresponsiveness. The precise mechanism responsible for eosinophil activation in vivo is not known, although in vitro cross-linking of IgA receptors on eosinophils, or eosinophil adhesion to the CS-1 region of fibronectin, are capable of stimulating mediator release.\\nEosinophils are considered to be proinflammatory cells \\nthat mediate many of the features of asthma and related allergic diseases. They have a characteristic bilobed nucleus and the cytoplasm of each cell contains about 20 membrane-bound, core-containing, specific granules that contain basic proteins such as major basic protein (MBP) (Fig. 1.21). In addition, eosinophils contain a number of primary granules, which lack a core and are of variable size. These granules contain Charcot–Leyden crystal protein (CLC protein), a characteristic feature of asth -\\nmatic sputum. Normal eosinophils contain about five non-membrane-bound lipid bodies, which are the princi -\\npal store of arachidonic acid and also contain the enzymes cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, which are required to synthesize prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Generally, the amount of cytokines produced by eosinophils is low compared with that produced by other cell types, though the increased number of eosinophils at sites of allergic inflammation may partially compensate.\\nFig. 1.21  Eosinophils. Eosinophils express receptors that, \\nwhen engaged by ligand, induce their proliferation (IL-5 \\nreceptor, IL-5R), chemoattraction into tissues (CCR-3), and apoptosis (Siglec-8).

In addition, antigen presentation through the high-affinity receptor for IgE, which is increased on the surface of human monocytes of atopic patients, results in an approximately 100-fold or greater increased efficiency in activating antigen-specific T cells. Thus, in allergic inflammation, changes occur in the alveolar macrophage population, which results in an enhanced capacity to present antigen and a loss of their immunosuppressive phenotype. This is attributed to changes in the local environment with evidence for an important role of GM-CSF. In addition, an increase in newly recruited monocytes that demon -\\nstrate increased antigen-presenting function is likely to contribute to enhanced antigen presentation in the asth -\\nmatic lung.\\nBone marrow\\nThe bone marrow is likely to play an important effector role in allergic inflammation through production of leu -\\nkocyte effector cells and leukocyte progenitors. Most of the leukocyte effector cells associated with allergic inflammation, namely basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, and monocytes, are produced in the bone marrow and travel to sites of allergic inflammation. In addition,  \\nallergen challenge induces trafficking of bone marrow progenitors such as eosinophil progenitors to sites of  \\nallergic inflammation in the tissues where under local microenvironmental stimuli they can differentiate into mature eosinophils. Thus, the bone marrow may be a source not only of mature leukocytes but also of precur -\\nsor leukocyte populations that travel to sites of allergic inflammation.\\nNerves\\nNeural mechanisms may play a role in allergic inflamma -\\ntion through interactions with inflammatory cells or phagocytic function ( Fig. 1.23). T oll-like receptors \\nexpressed by macrophages play an important role in their activation. Macrophages at tissue sites of allergic inflam-mation originate from mononuclear cell in the bone marrow. In addition to their phagocytic and antigen pre-senting role, macrophages have the potential to be proin -\\nflammatory or antiinflammatory based on the spectrum of mediators they are able to release. For example, mac -\\nrophages release proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1β, TNF-α) and chemokines (e.g. IL-8), which have all been detected at sites of allergic inflammation. In addition macrophages release biologically active lipids, reactive oxygen and nitrogen metabolites. Macrophages may be activated by allergen via the low-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRII) as well as by Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) and LTD\\n4. Thus, there are several mechanisms through \\nwhich macrophages could be acivated to express pro -\\ninflammatory cytokines at sites of allergic inflammation. Macrophages are also able to express antiinflammatory cytokines including the IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-10 and IL-12, which provides a potential for macrophages to down-regulate allergic inflammatory responses. There is some evidence that the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 is reduced in both blood monocytes and alveolar macro -\\nphages from allergic patients with asthma.\\nMacrophage subsets: M1 vs M2  \\nmacrophages\\nThere is emerging evidence of distinct macrophage subsets (M1 and M2) with the M2 macrophage playing a greater role in Th2-mediated inflammation. The ability of the Th2 cytokine IL-4 to induce the differentiation of M2-like macrophages suggests that M2 macrophages may be important at sites of allergic inflammation. In contrast, Th1 cytokines such as IFN- γ or bacterial products such \\nas LPS promote M1 macrophages, which induce strong IL-12-mediated Th1 responses. There is also emerging evidence of distinct monocyte subsets (Gr1\\n−/Ly-6Clow \\nand Gr1+/Ly-6Chigh) with distinct functions and fates, \\nsuch as the differentiation into cells with features of M1 or M2 macrophages respectively.Fig. 1.23  Macrophage mediators.

Currently \\nover 70 cytokines have been identified (e.g. interleukins 1 to 35, growth factors, etc.) of which a subset is known to be expressed during episodes of allergic inflammation (T able 1.2). Cytokines predominantly act on closely adja -\\ncent cells (the paracrine effect), but can also act on the cells of their origin (the autocrine effect), and rarely on distant cells in another organ (the systemic effect). Cytokines are involved in orchestrating the initiation, maintenance, and resolution of the allergic inflammatory response. In allergic inflammation, cytokines are both active in the bone marrow where they regulate the devel -\\nopment and differentiation of inflammatory cells (e.g. IL-5 induces eosinophilopoesis), and are also expressed at tissue sites of allergic inflammation (e.g. lower airway in asthma) where they regulate the immune and inflam -\\nmatory response. Cytokines function through complex cytokine networks to promote or inhibit inflammation. During an inflammatory response the profile of cytokines expressed, as well as the profile of cytokine receptors expressed on responding cell types and the timing of their expression, will determine whether the response is pre -\\ndominantly pro- or anti-inflammatory. Activation of high-affinity cytokine receptors on target cells induces a cascade of intracellular signalling pathways that regulate the transcription of specific genes and the ultimate cel -\\nlular inflammatory response. Considerable progress has been made in characterizing the cellular sources and actions of the numerous cytokines involved in allergic inflammation (see T able 1.2). Overall, these studies \\nsuggest that cytokines exhibit redundancy (i.e. several cytokines can often subserve the same function), and that several cell types can generate or respond to the same cytokine. Thus, therapeutic strategies in allergic inflam -\\nmation aimed at neutralizing a single cytokine may not through direct effects on target organs such as smooth muscle, mucous glands, and blood vessels. Studies have investigated the role of cholinergic nerves, adrenergic nerves, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic nerves, and neu -\\nropeptides such as substance P , calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in contributing to allergic inflammation. One of the best-studied neural pathways is the sensory nerve reflex. Activation of local tissue sensory nerves at sites of allergic inflammation may acti -\\nvate cholinergic reflexes. Stimulated cholinergic nerves can rapidly induce smooth muscle contraction, mucus hypersecretion, and vasodilation. The vasodilation may contribute to nasal congestion at sites of allergic inflam -\\nmation. Sensory nerves at sites of allergic inflammation can be triggered by non-specific chemical and physical irritants, bradykinin, histamine, leukotrienes, and pros -\\ntaglandins particularly after the loss of overlying epithe -\\nlium. In addition, inflammatory mediators may act on various prejunctional nerve receptors to modulate the release of neurotransmitters. For example, mast cell products (especially histamine and PGD\\n2) and eosinophil \\nmediators can up-regulate the activity of the cholinergic ganglia.\\nModulation of allergic responses \\nby cytokines, chemokines, and \\nadhesion molecules\\nWhat are cytokines?\\nCytokines are extracellular signalling molecules that bind \\nto specific cell surface cytokine receptors to regulate both \\nTable 1.2  Cyt okines in allergic inflammation\\nCytokine Cell source Actions\\nIL-1β Predominately monocytes, macrophages; also \\nsmooth muscle, endothelium, epitheliumActivation of T cells and endothelium\\nIL-2 Predominantly T cells; also NK cells Promotes T-cell proliferation and clonal expansion\\nIL-3 T cells, mast cells, eosinophils Stimulates development of mast cells and basophils; promotes eosinophil survival\\nIL-4 Predominantly Th2 cells; also basophils, NK T cells, mast cells, eosinophilsPromotes T-cell differentiation to Th2 phenotype, class switching to IgE, up-regulation of VCAM-1 on endothelial cells\\nIL-5 T cells, mast cells, eosinophils Promotes eosinophil growth, differentiation and \\nsurvival\\nIL-6 Predominantly monocytes, macrophages; also \\neosinophils, mast cells, fibroblastsDifferentiation of T cells into Th17 cells and B cells into plasma cells', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n"," Document(page_content='Introduction to mechanisms of allergic disease1\\n20\\nTable 1.2  Contin ued\\nCytokine Cell source Actions\\nIL-8 Predominantly macrophages; also T cells, mast \\ncells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, neutrophilsNeutrophil activation and differentiation; chemotactic factor for neutrophils\\nIL-9 T cells, T9 cells Enhances mast-cell growth; increases mucus expression\\nIL-10 T cells, B cells, macrophages, monocytes Inhibits T-cell proliferation and down-regulates \\nproinflammatory cytokine production by Th1 and \\nTh2 cells\\nIL-12 Predominantly dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophagesPromotes Th1 phenotype and IFN-γ production; \\ninhibits Th2 development and cytokine \\nexpression; suppresses IgE production\\nIL-13 Predominantly Th2 cells; also mast cells, \\nbasophils, eosinophilsPromotes class switching to IgE, increased expression of VCAM-1 on endothelial cells, increased airway hyperactivity\\nIL-16 Predominantly CD8+ T cells; also mast cells, \\nairway epitheliumRecruitment of CD4+ T cells and eosinophils\\nIL-17 Th17 cells, CD4+ T cells, neutophils, basophils Induces neutrophil recruitment and activation\\nIL-18 Predominantly macrophages; also airway \\nepithelial cellsMember of IL-1 family; activates B cells.

The role of adhesion molecules expressed by circulating leukocytes and adhesion counter-receptors expressed by endothelial cells has been exten -\\nsively investigated to determine pathways for general tissue recruitment of leukocytes, as well as to identify mechanisms that mediate selective tissue recruitment of leukocyte subpopulations (e.g. eosinophils at sites of allergic inflammation). In order to accumulate in the airway in diseases such as asthma, circulating leukocytes derived from the bone marrow must adhere to the endothelium lining the blood vessels of the bronchial microcirculation, penetrate the vessel wall, and migrate to the airway lumen. Cell adhesion molecules are involved in all stages of this process.\\nCell adhesion molecules and leukocyte \\nadhesion to endothelium\\nAdhesion molecules involved in leukocyte trafficking are \\ngrouped into three families based on structural features: the selectins, the integrins, and the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene superfamily ( T able 1.3). Studies of leukocyte adhe -\\nsion to endothelium in vitro, as well as in vivo, and observation of the living microcirculation using intravital microscopy (Fig. 1.24), have delineated the coordinated sequence of events responsible for the tissue accumula -\\ntion of circulating leukocytes. In the absence of inflam -\\nmation, circulating leukocytes rarely adhere to the blood vessel wall that does not constitutively express adhesion molecules. However, allergic individuals when exposed to an allergen on a mucosal surface (e.g. nasal mucosa) release cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-4, IL-13, and TNF- α) and mediators (e.g. histamine) derived from cell types includ -\\ning mast cells and macrophages. These released cytokines and mediators bind to their respective receptors on endothelial cells and up-regulate local endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression. The local up-regulation of adhesion molecule expression by endothelium at the site of allergen challenge localizes circulating leukocytes to that site. Circulating leukocytes are tethered to adhesion molecules expressed by endothelium via a transient adhe -\\nsive interaction that results in leukocytes rolling along  \\nthe endothelium of postcapillary venules ( Fig. 1.25). The \\nselectin family of adhesion molecules expressed by endothelium and their glycoprotein ligands expressed by leukocytes largely mediate this process, although the very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) integrin is also able to subserve this tethering function in eosinophils and lymphocytes. Subsequent activation of leukocyte integrins by chemoat -\\ntractants (e.g. chemokines, anaphylatoxins, formylated peptides, and lipid mediators) causes the rolling leuko -\\ncyte to arrest, firmly adhere, and flatten (reducing expo -\\nsure to shear forces generated by blood flow and increasing surface area in contact with endothelium) (see Fig. 1.25). \\nIntegrins and immunoglobulin superfamily member adhe -\\nsion molecules mediate these steps of leukocyte firm adhesion to endothelium. Finally, the leukocytes migrate between endothelial cells (diapedesis) into the intersti-tium and move towards the source of the stimulus (chemotaxis). The importance of leukocyte adhesion molecules to leukocyte tissue recruitment is suggested from genetic disorders that result in defective leukocyte integrin adhesion molecules [leukocyte adhesion defi-ciency I (LAD I)], or defective leukocyte sialyl Lewis X (sLex) expression (LAD II). Patients with either of these leukocyte adhesion deficiencies have neutrophil adhesion defects, tissues that lack neutrophils, associated blood neutrophilia, and recurrent infections as neutrophils cannot bind to endothelial cells and emigrate into infected tissues to mediate host defence against infection.Fig. 1.24  P ostcapillary leukocyte recruitment.

A given leukocyte often expresses multiple chemokine receptors, and more than one chemokine typically binds to the same receptor.

In addition to the predominant expression of CC chemokine receptors, eosinophils, basophils, and mononuclear cells express the CXC chemokine receptor CXCR4, which is also expressed on neutrophils. The ligand for CXCR4 is the CXC chemokine SDF-1 (stromal cell derived factor-1).\\nT-cell subsets and chemokine receptors\\nAlthough certain chemokine receptors have been associ-ated with specific T-cell subsets, chemokine receptor expression in vivo is complex and overlapping. Examples of chemokine receptors expressed on T-cell subsets include CCR4 and CCR8 on Th2 cells, and CCR5, CXCR3, and CXCR6 on Th1 cells ( Fig. 1.30 ).\\nCCR3 antagonists and allergic inflammation\\nThe CC chemokine receptor CCR3 is expressed on mul -\\ntiple leukocytes important to the allergic inflammatory response including eosinophils, basophils, and activated Th2-type lymphocytes. As several CC chemokines (eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, eotaxin-3, RANTES, MIP-1, mac -\\nrophage chemoattractant protein-2, -3, -4 or MCP-2, -3, -4) activate a common CCR-3 receptor, there has been particular interest in the therapeutic potential of using chemokine-receptor antagonists targeting one receptor (i.e. CCR3) to inhibit the actions of multiple CC chem -\\nokines on eosinophils and other inflammatory cells. Several small molecule inhibitors of CCR3 are effective in inhibiting eosinophil recruitment in animal models of leukocyte. This change in leukocyte integrin affinity from a low-affinity to a high-affinity integrin binding state  \\nleads to tight adherence of the leukocyte to endothelium and subsequent leukocyte extravasation. Once the leuko -\\ncyte extravasates between endothelial cells into the extracellular space, the chemokine concentration gradi-ent promotes directed cell migration to the site of inflammation.\\nCC chemokines and allergic inflammation\\nAs CC chemokines are expressed at increased levels at sites of allergic inflammation and attract cells important to the perpetuation of the allergic inflammatory response (e.g. eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes), they have received attention as a target to modulate the allergic inflammatory response. Studies in asthmatics have established that CC chemokines are expressed by \\nairway epithelial cells, and that allergen challenge can \\nup-regulate expression of chemokines in the airway. The levels of chemokines expressed during allergen-induced late phase responses demonstrate correlations between individual chemokines and subsets of leukocytes which respond to these chemokines. During inflammatory responses epithelial cells, macrophages and, to a lesser extent, eosinophils and lymphocytes localized to the sub -\\nepithelial layer are significant sources of chemokines. CC chemokines important to allergic inflammation include TARC (CCL17) and MDC (CCL22), which attract Th2 cells, and eotaxins-1,-2-3 (CCL11, CCL24, CCL26), which attract eosinophils, while MCP-1 (CCL2) is a potent mononuclear cell attractant (see T able 1.4 ).\\nChemokine receptors\\nChemokine receptors belong to the seven transmem -\\nbrane receptor superfamily of G-protein-coupled recep -\\ntors and include ten human CC chemokine receptor genes (they are known as CCR1 through CCR10), and seven CXCR receptors have been identified (they are referred to as CXCR1 through CXCR7).\\nCCR chemokine receptor family\\nThe CCR chemokine receptors are expressed on cells important to allergic inflammation including eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, whereas the CXCR are expressed mainly on neutrophils and lymphocytes. Activation of chemokine cell surface receptors by specific chemokines results in activation of a cascade of intracellular signalling pathways, including guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins of the Ras and Rho families, leading ultimately to the formation of cell surface protrusions termed uropods and lamellipods, which are required for cellular locomotion. Some chem-okine receptors are expressed only on certain cell types, whereas other chemokine receptors are more widely expressed. In addition, some chemokine receptors are \\nFig. 1.30  Chemokine receptors and T-cell subsets.

Inter -\\nestingly, incubating eosinophils with the survival cytokine IL-5 does not prevent their apoptosis being induced by activation of Siglec-8 receptors.\\nRemodelling as a consequence of \\nchronic allergic inflammation\\nIn contrast to the complete resolution of allergic inflam-\\nmation without significant structural changes in the vast majority of individuals, a subset of subjects best studied in asthma may be predisposed to develop structural tissue changes termed ‘airway remodelling’. These structural changes include subepithelial fibrosis, smooth muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia, angiogenesis, mucus metapla -\\nsia, and deposition of increased amounts of extracellular matrix. Allergen challenge in asthmatics can also induce expression of TGF-β1, a proremodelling cytokine, and increased expression of extracellular matrix genes. Anti-IL-5, which reduces levels of eosinophils expressing TGF-β1 in the airway, can reduce levels of deposition of extracellular matrix proteins in the airway. However, other factors in addition to allergic inflammation, such as viral infections, tobacco smoke, pollutants, as well as genetic factors are likely to contribute to the develop-ment of significant remodelling in a subset of allergic asthmatics.\\nFibroblasts\\nFibroblasts proliferate in response to several cytokines and mediators generated during an allergic inflammatory response. Recognized fibroblast mitogens include hista -\\nmine, heparin, and tryptase derived from mast cells, and major basic protein (MBP) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) from eosinophils. The cytokines TGF- β as well \\nas platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), b-fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IL-1, and endothelin released during chronic allergic inflammation promote fibroblast proliferation, differen -\\ntiation, and activation.\\nTGF-β enhances production of a range of extracellular \\nmatrix components, and decreases the synthesis of matrix-degrading enzymes while increasing the synthesis of protease inhibitors. Thus, TGF- β promotes the deposi -\\ntion of extracellular matrix while inhibiting its degrada -\\ntion, and contributes to the widespread subepithelial extracellular matrix deposition that may be associated with chronic allergic inflammation.\\nChronic allergic inflammation may lead to the deposi -\\ntion of types III and V ‘repair’ collagens in the lamina reticularis beneath the types IV and VII ‘reticular’ col -\\nlagens, which largely make up the basement membrane. The altered sub-basement membrane region also contains allergic inflammation and are currently undergoing clini-cal trials.\\nLipid chemoattractants\\nIn addition to chemokines, lipid chemoattractants also play an important role in recruiting leukocytes to sites of allergic inflammation. For example leukotriene B4 attracts neutrophils, platelet-activating factor (PAF) attracts mul -\\ntiple leukocyte cell types, and PGD\\n2 recruits T cells \\nexpressing CRTH2 receptors.\\nResolution of allergic \\ninflammation and remodelling\\nThe vast majority of episodes of allergic inflammation \\nresolve with no significant structural changes to the tissues involved. However, in a minority of subjects remodelling of tissues occur and this has been best studied in the lung in asthma.\\nApoptosis as a mechanism for \\nresolution of inflammation\\nApoptosis and necrosis are two mechanisms by which cell \\ndeath occurs. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a mechanism for resolution of allergic or other forms of inflammation. Apoptotic cells are removed by neighbor -\\ning phagocytic cells without loss of their potentially harmful cell contents. In contrast to apoptosis, necrosis is a pathological form of cell death resulting from acute cellular injury. Necrosis is always associated with loss of intracellular mediators and enzymes into the extracellular environment and the consequential potential induction of an inflammatory response. Biochemically, apoptosis is characterized by a controlled autodigestion of the cell. Intracellular proteases called caspases are essential medi -\\nators of the apoptotic death machinery. Caspases are processed by cleavage at specific aspartate residues to form active heterodimeric enzymes. It appears that cas -\\npases work in a hierarchical system similar to other pro -\\nteolytic cascades such as complement activation or blood coagulation. Caspase-mediated proteolysis results in cytoskeletal disruption, cell shrinkage, membrane bleb -\\nbing, and nucleus condensation. More recently a third form of cell death autophagy has been described in which starving cells, or cells deprived of growth factors, gener -\\nate energy and metabolites by digesting their own organelles and macromolecules.\\nEosinophils provide an example of a cell type that has \\nreceptors that if activated can increase eosinophil survival [e.g. IL-5, GM-CSF, or IL-3 receptor] as well as recep-tors that when triggered induce eosinophil apoptosis (Siglec-8, Fas).

The EPR is initiated by \\nthe release of mast cell mediators following allergen chal -\\nlenge of a sensitized individual. Although the spectrum of mediators is essentially the same in all tissues, the symptoms provoked are different due to differences in the anatomy of their target tissues (e.g. bronchoconstric -\\ntion in the lower airways, rhinorrhoea and congestion in the nose, and a wheal and flare response in the skin). The EPR generally develops within approximately 10 minutes of allergen exposure, reaching a maximum at 30 minutes, and resolving within 1–2 hours. In the absence of further allergen inhalation, a LPR may also occur, reaching a maximum at 6–12 hours and resolving by 24 hours. The EPR results from IgE-dependent activation of mast cells which release preformed mediators including histamine, as well as newly generated lipid mediators including leu -\\nkotrienes (LTC\\n4, LTD 4, and LTE 4), prostanoids [prostag -\\nlandins D 2, F2α (PGD 2, PGF 2α), and thromboxane A 2 \\n(TXA 2)].\\nA characteristic feature of the LPR is the recruitment \\nof inflammatory cells particularly eosinophils, as well as CD4+ Th2 cells, mononuclear cells, and basophils. These inflammatory cells recruited from the circulation release cytokines and proinflammatory mediators. The profile of cytokines released during the LPR is characterized by the expression of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13) rather than Th1 cytokines [interferon- γ (IFN-γ, IL-12)]. \\nCorticosteroids have an inhibitory effect on the LPR and also reduce the number of cells expressing IL-4 mRNA and IL-5 mRNA, and the number of eosinophils.\\nEPR and LPR in the lung\\nInhalation of allergen by sensitized individuals results in an early phase response with airway narrowing which develops within 10–15 minutes, reaches a maximum within 30 minutes, and generally resolves within 1–3 hours response. The main clinical manifestation of the early phase response is dyspnea, chest tightness, wheez -\\ning, and cough. In some of these subjects, a late phase response occurs after 3–4 hours and reaches a maximum at 6–12 hours (Fig. 1.31). The mechanism of bronchoc-onstriction is complex and results from a combination of bronchial smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability leading to oedema, and increased airway mucus production. Histamine, PGD\\n2, and CysLT s all \\nhave the ability to contract human bronchial smooth muscle. In addition to causing bronchoconstriction, his -\\ntamine and the CysLT s can increase vascular permeability and stimulate mucus production. The LPR in the lung is associated with significant recruitment of eosinophils. Anti-IgE inhibits both the EPR as well as the LPR response in the lung. Interestingly, anti-IL-5 does not significantly inhibit the LPR response to allergen challenge.increased deposition of extracellular matrix components including fibronectin, tenascin, and lamin. Myofibroblasts present below the basement membrane are increased in number in asthma and are the source of many of the extracellular matrix products that are expressed after allergen challenge.\\nExtracellular matrix\\nExtracellular matrix proteins\\nThe extracellular matrix produced by fibroblasts consists of a variety of proteins and complex carbohydrates. Approximately one-third of the dry mass of lung tissue is collagen, largely types 1, 3, and 5, whereas collagen types 4 and 7 are the main components of basement membrane. Elastin makes up another one-third of the dry mass of lung tissue, and the remainder is composed of glycoproteins – fibronectin, tenascin, laminin, the prote-oglycan heparan sulphate, hyaluronan, and other minor matrix components. The composition of matrix elements may be altered by several products of the allergic inflam -\\nmatory response especially matrix-degrading proteases (i.e. matrix metalloproteases or MMPs). Thus, the aller -\\ngic inflammatory process may alter the dynamic balance between matrix breakdown and synthesis.\\nExtracellular matrix metalloproteases\\nMMPs play a role in remodelling of the extracellular matrix and thus may play a role in the development of airway remodelling and airway hyperresponsiveness. MMPs are zinc-dependent endopeptidases present in many leukocytes that have specific and selective activity against many components of the extracellular matrix which they degrade into fragments. MMP-9, MMP-2 and ADAM-33 are examples of proteases that have been most extensively studied in allergic inflammation because of their increased levels of expression in allergic inflamma -\\ntion or in the case of ADAM-33 genetic linkage to asthma. All MMPs are inhibited by related compounds called tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs). For example, TIMP-1 binds to both pro-MMP-9 and active MMP-9, inhibiting MMP-9 function.\\nIn vivo studies of the allergic \\ninflammatory response\\nEarly phase response (EPR) and late phase response (LPR)\\nIn allergic subjects the immune and inflammatory \\nresponse to an allergen challenge can be investigated in the nose, lung, or skin.

The third component of the triple response is an area of erythema, or flare, around the wheal. This is initiated by the stimulation of hista -\\nmine receptors on afferent non-myelinated nerves, which results in the release of neuropeptides with consequent vasodilatation and skin erythema. Histamine-induced nerve stimulation also results in itch. The size of the flare is again dose dependent and may measure several centi -\\nmetres across. The wheal-and-flare generally resolves within about 30 minutes. However, in up to 50% of sub-jects challenged intradermally with a high dose of allergen the immediate reaction evolves into a late phase reaction characterized by an indurated erythematous inflamma -\\ntory reaction. The latter reaches a peak at about 6–8 hours and often persists for 24 hours. The reduction in the size of the LPR to intradermal allergen challenge cor -\\nrelates well with the clinical response to subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy in patients with allergic rhinitis.EPR and LPR in the nose\\nIn the nose, topical allergen challenge of sensitized indi-viduals causes immediate nasal reactions involving itching, sneezing, congestion, and watery discharges. The early response usually abates within 1–3 hours. In contrast to the dual allergic response in the lower airways, distinct late phase responses are not common in the nose although low-grade nasal inflammation and symptoms may con -\\ntinue well beyond the first 3 hours after challenge with large amounts of allergen. Furthermore, nasal allergen challenge has a ‘priming’ effect, with the nasal mucosa exhibiting an increased responsiveness to histamine or to a second allergen challenge on the day after the initial challenge. Rhinorrhoea, caused by a combination of local vasodilatation and mucous gland stimulation, is largely histamine mediated, thus explaining the effectiveness of antihistamines in treating these symptoms. As most of the early phase obstruction to airflow in the upper airways is reversed by α-adrenergic receptor vasoconstrictor \\ndrugs, this suggests that acute filling of venous sinuses rather than tissue oedema is responsible for nasal block-age. Nasal congestion is poorly inhibited by antihista -\\nmines, suggesting that mediators other than histamine are playing a more prominent role.\\nEPR and LPR in the skin\\nIntradermal injection of allergen induces a characteristic ‘triple response’ characterized by an almost immediate reddening of the skin (histamine-mediated arteriolar vasodilatation) at the site of allergen injection, which is followed within 5–10 minutes by the development of an Fig. 1.31  Ear ly and late phase responses in asthma.

In addition, Th2 cytokine responses and eosinophilic inflammation are a characteristic feature of chronic allergic inflammation. Cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules play a key role in regulating the immune and inflammatory response in allergic inflamma -\\ntion. An improved understanding of the complex molecu -\\nlar mechanisms of allergic diseases will help to identify potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Anti-IgE, leukotriene antagonists, and anti-IL-5 are examples of therapies that have targeted specific pathways associ-ated with allergic inflammation and provided important insight into the contribution of these pathways to the pathogenesis of individual diseases associated with aller -\\ngic inflammation. Clinical trials with cytokine antago -\\nnists, chemokine inhibitors, adhesion molecule antagonists, or compounds that interfere with intracellulalar signalling pathways or the transcription of genes important to aller -\\ngic inflammation will improve our understanding of the function of these individual molecules in allergic inflam -\\nmation. The use of any of these antagonists in clinical practice will be dependent on their relative potency in inhibiting allergic inflammation (e.g. therapeutic effi -\\ncacy), as well as evidence that they do not significantly impair host defence to infection or immune surveillance (e.g. side-effect profile).Mast cell dependence of EPR\\nThe detection of extracellularly released mast-cell-derived mediators (i.e. histamine, PGD\\n2, tryptase) at \\nsites of early phase responses, as well as the ability of mast-cell-directed therapies such as anti-IgE and cromo -\\nlyn to block the early phase response provide evidence for the important role of the mast cell in the early phase response.

For most phenotypes and disease it is now recognized that both factors play an important role and it is the interaction between these factors that determines an individual’s susceptibility to disease. The dawn of the new century has seen a revolution in our understanding of the genetic basis of common diseases such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and neuropsychiatric conditions. These diseases are termed ‘complex genetic diseases’ as they result from the effect of multiple genetic and inter -\\nacting environmental factors (see Appendix 2.1, p. 50 for common genetic \\nterms).\\nLike these other common conditions, the role of a heritable component to \\nsusceptibility to allergic disease has long been recognized, with atopy and the clinical manifestation of allergy such as asthma and atopic dermatitis resulting from the interaction between an individual’s genetic make-up and their  \\nenvironmental exposures. Recent years have seen considerable progress in unravelling the contribution of specific genetic factors to an individual’s sus -\\nceptibility, subsequent development, and severity of allergic disease. This has resulted in increasing insight into novel areas of allergic disease pathophysiol -\\nogy. Furthermore, studies of gene–environment interaction have lead to greater insight into the importance of environmental triggers for the initia -\\ntion, exacerbation, and persistence of allergic diseases. Studies of the timing of action of genetic variants in determining disease susceptibility have high -\\nlighted the importance of in utero development and early life in determining susceptibility to allergic disease. In the future, genetic discoveries in allergic disease will potentially lead to better endophenotyping, prognostication, prediction of treatment response, and insights into molecular pathways in order to develop more targeted therapy for these conditions.\\nHeritability of allergic disease\\nHeritability is the proportion of observed variation in a particular trait that can be attributed to inherited genetic factors in contrast to environmental ones. The fact that a disease has been observed to ‘run in families’ is insuf -\\nficient evidence to begin molecular genetic studies because this can occur for The genetic basis of \\nallergy and asthma\\nJohn W Holloway and Stephen T Holgate2\\nDEFINITION\\nAllergic diseases cluster in \\nfamilies indicating an important role for susceptibility genes.

Atopic asthma has also been widely studied, and both twin and family studies have shown a strong heritable component to this phenotype, although estimates of the contribution of genetics to atopy and allergic disease susceptibility vary widely from 40 to >80% and it is apparent that the \\ngenetic contribution to risk of allergic disease such as asthma (λ\\nSib ~2–3) is weaker than that of other common \\nconditions such as rheumatoid arthritis ( λSib 8), type 1 \\ndiabetes (λ Sib 14) and Crohn disease (λ Sib 30) . The herit-\\nability of many allergic disease related phenotypes has also been studied and has shown that genetic factors influence not just disease susceptibility per se but all aspects of disease. For example, for asthma, heritability studies have shown there is genetic influence in many aspects, from susceptibility to atopy and regulation of total and specific IgE levels, to blood eosinophil levels, susceptibility to asthma per se, degree of bronchial hyper -\\nresponsiveness, severity of asthma symptoms, and even risk of mortality from asthma. Genetic factors also play a major role in determining asthma remission, with a family history of both atopy and asthma being associated with lower rates of remission.\\nOnce familial aggregation with a probable genetic aeti -\\nology for a disease has been established, the mode of inheritance can be determined by observing the pattern of inheritance of a disease or trait by observing how it is distributed within families. For example, is there evi -\\ndence of a single major gene, and is it dominantly or recessively inherited? Segregation analysis of allergic disease phenotype failed to find evidence of any consist -\\nent clear inheritance pattern for a number of allergic phenotypes and diseases. This confirms that, in contrast to rare monogenic diseases such as Netherton syndrome, ichthyosis vulgaris, and hyper-IgE syndrome, whose phenotypes include aspects of allergic disease such as high serum IgE levels and atopic dermatitis, common forms of these conditions are determined by the actions, and the interactions, of multiple genetic factors  \\n(Fig. 2.1 ).\\nFinding genes for allergic \\ndisease\\nVariation in DNA sequences occurs once in approxi -\\nmately every 200–500 base pairs in the human genome. a number of reasons, including common environmental \\nexposure and biased ascertainment, as well as having a true genetic disposition. There are a number of approaches that can be taken to determine whether genetics contrib -\\nutes to a disease or disease phenotype of interest – includ -\\ning family studies, segregation analysis, twin and adoption studies, heritability studies, and population-based relative risk to relatives of probands.\\nIn twin studies, heritability is estimated by comparing \\nthe concordance rates of monozygotic twins for particular traits with those of dizygotic twins for the same traits, with monozygotic twins being genetically identical (for nuclear DNA) and dizygotic twins (on average) sharing 50% of their segregating DNA variation in common. Therefore, a disease that has a genetic component is expected to show a higher rate of concordance in monozy -\\ngotic than in dizygotic twins. In adoption studies, if the disease has a genetic basis the frequency of the disease should be higher in biologic relatives of probands than in members of their adopted family.\\nFamily studies involve the estimation of the frequency \\nof the disease in relatives of affected compared with unaffected individuals. The strength of the genetic effect can be measured as λ\\nR, where λR is the ratio of risk to \\nrelatives of type R (e.g. sibs, parents, offspring, etc.) compared with the population risk. The stronger the genetic effect, the higher is the value of λ. For example, \\nfor a recessive single gene mendelian disorder such as cystic fibrosis the value of λ is about 500; for a dominant \\ndisorder such as Huntington’s disease it is about 5000. For complex disorders the values of λ are much lower \\ne.g. 20–30 for multiple sclerosis, 15 for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and 4 to 5 for Alzheimer’s disease. It is important to note though that λ is a function \\nof both the strength of the genetic effect and the fre -\\nquency of the disease in the population. Therefore a disease with a λ of 3 to 4 does not mean that genes are \\nless important in that trait than in a trait with a λ of 30 \\nto 40. A strong effect in a very common disease will have a smaller λ than the same strength of effect in a rare \\ndisease.\\nIn 1860, Henry Hyde Salter in his magnus opus, On \\nasthma its pathology and treatment , wrote ‘Is asthma \\nhereditary? I think there can be no doubt that it is.’ Sub -\\nsequent to this, many studies have now conclusively shown that susceptibility to asthma and other allergic diseases has a heritable component.\\nThe results of many studies have now established that \\nboth atopy and atopic disease such as asthma, rhinitis, and eczema have strong genetic components. Family studies have shown an increased prevalence of atopy, and phenotypes associated with atopy, among the relatives of atopic compared with non-atopic subjects.

Sequence variations (mutations) occurring in over 1% of the population are termed ‘polymorphisms’ and those that occur in less than 1% are termed ‘rare alleles’. Polymorphism in DNA sequence between individuals can take many forms including differences at a single base pair involving sub-stitution, insertion, or deletion of a single nucleotide (commonly termed ‘single nucleotide polymorphisms’ or SNPs) and repetition, insertion, or deletion of longer stretches of DNA ranging from a few base pairs to many thousands of base pairs, often termed ‘copy number vari -\\nations’ or CNVs. The different versions of the nucleotide sequence present at any one location in the genome (locus) are termed ‘alleles’. Polymorphisms form the basis of human diversity, including our responses to envi -\\nronmental stimuli. Genetic epidemiology has provided statistical methods for measuring the effects of gene polymorphisms on a clinical phenotype.\\nThere have been a number of approaches utilized to \\nidentify genetic factors that contribute to allergic disease susceptibility. The approach utilized will depend on a number of variables including the phenotype to be ana -\\nlysed, the population available for analysis (case-control cohorts, or family cohorts) and the genetic approach to be utilized.\\nIn general there are two broad approaches to genetic \\nanalysis: linkage and association analysis. Linkage analysis involves proposing a model to explain the inheritance pattern of phenotypes and genotypes observed in a pedi -\\ngree. When two genes are close together they are said to be linked. Therefore, alleles at such loci have a tendency to pass together into each gamete. Thus any disturbance of independent assortment, as defined by Mendel’s second law, provides an important clue that two genes are linked. If the chromosomal location of one of the genes is known, then the other can be mapped to the same region. If the genetic variant predisposing to  \\nthe disease of interest and the genetic marker loci are on separate chromosomes, independent assortment will occur and the disease and markers should be found as often together as apart in the offspring. If the disease and marker loci lie close together on the same chromosome, independent assortment will not occur and the disease and marker will occur together in each child unless they are separated by crossover at meiosis. As the distance between the disease locus and a marker locus increases so the chance of recombination in the interval between them increases and the proportion of recombinant increases. If the disease and marker loci are separated by a considerable distance on the same chromosome, then crossover between the loci is highly likely and the disease and marker traits will occur separately in each recom -\\nbinant but together in non-recombinants.\\nThe evidence for linkage of a genomic region to a phe -\\nnotype of interest is usually expressed in terms of the ratio of their odds of the two hypotheses (linkage or non-linkage), the likelihood ratio (LR), or more equivalently by the lod score (Z), where Z = log\\n10(LR). Both paramet-\\nric (involving prior specification of a genetic model) and, more commonly in complex disease, non-parametric linkage approaches such as allele sharing can be taken. Allele-sharing methods test whether the inheritance pattern of a particular chromosomal region is inconsistent with random mendelian segregation by showing that pairs of affected relatives inherit identical copies of the region more often than would be expected by chance. Affected sib-pair analysis is the simplest form of allele-sharing analysis. T wo sibs can show identical-by-descent (IBD) sharing for no, one, or two copies of any locus (with a \\n1 : 2 : 1 distribution expected under random segregation). \\nExcess allele sharing can be measured with a simple χ2 \\ntest.\\nAssociation studies do not examine inheritance pat-\\nterns of alleles; rather, they are case-control studies based on a comparison of allele frequencies between groups of affected and unaffected individuals from a population. A particular allele is said to be associated with the trait if it occurs at a significantly higher frequency among affected individuals than in the control group. The odds ratio of the trait in individuals is then assessed as the ratio of the frequency of the allele in the affected population compared with the unaffected population.\\nIt is important to remember with association studies \\nthat there are a number of reasons leading to an associa -\\ntion between a phenotype and a particular allele  \\n(Box 2.1 ).', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 45}),\n"," Document(page_content='The genetic basis of allergy and asthma2\\n36\\nBox 2.1  K ey concepts\\nExplanations for association (or lack of association) between polymorphism and allergic disease phenotype\\nA: Positive association\\nCausal link\\n\\uf06e The polymorphism tested directly affects gene(s) \\nexpression or protein function, resulting in increased \\nsusceptibility\\nLinkage disequilibrium\\n\\ue06a The polymorphism tested is not directly casual but is in \\nlinkage disequilibrium with an adjacent polymorphism that is.

Apart from the consideration of whether either of the studies \\nrepresents a false negative or positive association, it is \\nimportant to determine whether the studies truly replicate one another. For example, were they carried out in populations of similar genetic ancestry, or with \\nsimilar environmental exposures?

This association would be expected to be replicated in other populations with the same phenotype, unless there are several different alleles at the same locus contributing to the same phenotype, in which case association would be difficult to detect, or if the trait was predominantly the result of different genes in the other population (genetic heterogeneity), or depended on interaction with an environmental exposure not present in the replication population.\\n\\ue06a P ositive associations may also occur between an \\nallele and a phenotype if that particular allele is in linkage disequilibrium with the phenotype-causing allele. Linkage disequilibrium is the correlation between nearby variants such that the alleles at neighbouring polymorphisms (observed on the same chromosome) are associated within a population more often than if they were unlinked. Thus, an allele may show positive association with disease if the allele tends to occur on the same parental chromosome that also carries the trait-causing mutation more often than would be expected by chance.\\n\\ue06a P ositive association between an allele and a trait \\ncan also be artefactual as a result of recent population admixture. In a population of mixed ancestry, any trait present in a higher frequency in a subgroup of the population (e.g. a particular ethnic group) will show positive association with an allele that also happens to be more common in that population subgroup. T o avoid spurious association arising through admixture, studies should be performed in large, relatively homogeneous populations.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 46}),\n"," Document(page_content='Candidate gene versus genome-wide analysis\\n 2\\n37Other considerations in assessing the significance of \\nassociation studies include whether the size of the study \\nwas adequately powered if negative results are reported, whether the cases and controls were appropriately matched, which phenotypes were measured (and which have not) and how they were measured and whether reported statistical evidence levels have been adjusted to take account of multiple testing.\\nCandidate gene versus genome-\\nwide analysis\\nThere are two main approaches to the study of the genet -\\nics of disease: the candidate gene approach and the \\ngenome-wide or hypothesis-independent approach ( Fig. \\n2.2). In the candidate gene approach, genetic variation in individual genes is directly assessed for association with the disease phenotype of interest. In general, candidate genes are selected for analysis because of a known or postulated role for the encoded product of the gene in the disease process or an expression pattern associated with the disease. Polymorphisms within the gene that are believed to be functional (i.e. affecting gene expression or encoded protein function), or that are selected for maximal information on the basis of linkage disequilib -\\nrium patterns surrounding the gene (often termed ‘tagging SNPs’), are then tested for association with the disease or phenotype in question. A hybrid approach is the selec -\\ntion of candidate genes based not only on their function but also on their position within a genetic region previ -\\nously linked to the disease (positional candidate). However, by definition, the candidate gene approach is not capable of identifying all the major genetic factors predisposing towards a disease or identifying role for novel gene products in disease pathogenesis.\\nIf, as in most complex disorders, the exact biochemical \\nor physiological basis of the disease is unknown, it is often desirable to undertake a hypothesis-independent approach to the identification disease genes that considers the entire genome. One such method is to test genetic markers (most commonly microsatellites – short repeti-tive stretches of DNA that often vary between individu -\\nals) randomly spaced throughout the entire genome for linkage with the disease phenotype. If linkage is found between a particular marker and the phenotype, then further typing of genetic markers including SNPs and association analysis will enable the critical region to be further narrowed; the genes positioned in this region can be examined for possible involvement in the disease process and the presence of disease-causing genetic vari -\\nants in affected individuals. This approach is often termed ‘positional cloning’, or ‘genome scanning’ if the whole genome is examined in this manner. Although this approach requires no assumptions to be made about the particular gene involved in genetic susceptibility to the disease in question, it does require considerable molecu -\\nlar genetic analysis to be undertaken in large family cohorts, involving considerable time, resources, and expense.\\nMore recently, positional cloning by linkage analysis in \\nfamily cohorts has been superseded by the population-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach. This approach tests for association between SNPs  \\nevenly spaced throughout the genome and the disease or phenotype in question and, like linkage, is also an \\nFig. 2.2  Candidate gene versus genome-wide analysis. \\n(a) In candidate gene analysis genetic variation in a gene \\nselected on the basis of a known (or suspected) role in disease pathogenesis is tested for association with \\ndisease.

This explosion of activity can be attributed, in part, to the insights that genetic studies can bring to our understand -\\ning of disease pathogenesis ( Box 2.2 ).\\nInsight into disease pathogenesis\\nOne of the keys provided by identification of genetic susceptibility factors by disease is an increased insight into disease pathogenesis. The fact that genetic variation within the population that alters either a gene’s expres -\\nsion or the function of an encoded protein is associated with increased risk of disease suggests that the gene’s product, whether that be a functional non-coding RNA assumption-free approach. However, unlike positional cloning by linkage, GWAS does not require the recruit-ment and phenotyping of large family-based samples; rather, by the utilization of case-control cohorts it achieves much greater statistical power for the same number of individuals. The advent of the GWAS approach has been made possible by several technological developments in recent years including the characterization and mapping of millions of SNP variants in the human genome and technological advances in array-based SNP genotyping technologies that have made possible the simultaneous determination of the genotype of hundreds of thousands of SNPs throughout the genome of an individual. Genome-wide association studies have now revolution -\\nized the study of genetic factors in complex common disease. For hundreds of phenotypes – from common diseases such as Crohn’s disease and myocardial infarc -\\ntion to physiological measurements such as birth weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) and biological meas-urements such as circulating lipid levels and blood eosi -\\nnophil levels – GWAS have provided compelling statistical associations for hundreds of different loci in the human genome.\\nWhether by linkage or GWAS, the identification of an \\nassociated disease is only the beginning of the work required to understand its role in the disease pathogen -\\nesis. Further molecular genetic studies will be required to identify the precise genetic polymorphism that is exerting functional consequences for the gene’s expres -\\nsion or function, as opposed to those that are merely in linkage disequilibrium with the causal SNP . It is unlikely that the SNP showing the strongest association in the initial study will be the causal locus, as SNPs are chosen to provide maximal coverage of other variation in that region of the genome and not on biological function. Therefore, often fine mapping and haplotype (combina -\\ntions of alleles at adjacent polymorphisms) analysis of the region will be undertaken with the aim of identifying the causal locus. Gene expression analysis, both comparisons of a selection of cases with controls and inter-individual comparisons of different genotypes, can provide further evidence for a gene’s involvement in disease. If linkage disequilibrium prevents the identification of a specific gene in a region of high linkage disequilibrium spanning multiple genes, then the analysis of different racial and ethnic populations may aid localization.\\nOften the gene identified may be completely novel and \\ncell and molecular biology studies will be needed to understand the gene product’s role in the disease and to \\ndefine genotype  :  phenotype correlations. Furthermore, \\nby using cohorts with information available on environ -\\nmental exposures, it may be possible to define how the gene product may interact with the environment to cause disease. Ultimately, knowledge of the gene’s role in disease pathogenesis may lead to the development of novel therapeutics.Box 2.2  K ey concepts\\nWhat insights can genetics studies of allergic disease \\nprovide?\\nGreater understanding of disease pathogenesis\\n\\ue06a Identification of novel genes and pathways leading to \\nnew pharmacological targets for developing \\ntherapeutics\\nIdentification of environmental factors that interact with an individual’s genetic make-up to initiate disease, and confirmation of causality of environmental factors through \\nmendelian randomization\\n\\ue06a T argeted prevention of disease by environmental \\nmodification, possibly targeted to genetically at risk \\nindividuals\\nIdentification of susceptible Individuals\\n\\ue06a Ear ly-in-life screening and targeting of preventative \\ntherapies to at-risk individuals to prevent disease\\nTargeting of therapies\\n\\ue06a Subclassification of disease on the basis of genetics \\nand targeting of specific therapies based on this classification\\n\\ue06a Identification of individuals at risk of severe disease \\nand targeting of preventative treatments\\n\\ue06a Deter mination of the likelihood of an individual \\nresponding to, or suffering adverse reactions to, a particular therapy (pharmacogenetics) and individualized treatment plans\\nAdapted from Holloway JW, Yang IA, Holgate ST .

Furthermore, an observed synergistic interaction between gene and environmental exposure provides insight into how both the environmen -\\ntal effect and genetic effect cause disease. For example, recent studies have shown the association between SNPs in the susceptibility locus on chromosome 17q21 encom -\\npassing the ORMDL3/GSDMB genes has been shown to \\nbe confined to early onset asthma, and in particular those who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke in early life. The association of these 17q21 variants is also enhanced in those children who experience respiratory infections before the age of 2 years, with the strongest association in those children exposed to both tobacco smoke and respiratory infections.\\nSecondly, the use of genetic epidemiology is likely to \\npresent real opportunities for solving problems of casual inference in observational epidemiology. Epidemiological studies of environmental exposures may identify spurious causes of disease due to confounding by behavioural, physiological, and socioeconomic factors related both to exposures and to disease end points. For example, the epidemiological findings that hormone replacement therapy protects against coronary heart disease, and vitamin E and vitamin C reduce risk of cardiovascular disease, have all been refuted by randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and have raised concerns about the value of epidemiological studies. One solution to this is the use of mendelian randomization. This approach is based on Mendel’s second law that inheritance of one trait is or a protein, must play an important role in the disease pathogenesis. Thus genetic studies, especially hypothesis-independent genome-wide approaches, have the poten -\\ntial to identify novel biological mechanisms underlying disease, potentially leading to new pharmacologic targets for therapeutics. For example, the first novel asthma sus -\\nceptibility locus to be identified by a GWAS approach contains the ORMDL3 and GSDMB genes on chromo-\\nsome 17q12-21. The observation of association between polymorphisms at this locus has been extensively repli -\\ncated in subsequent studies and the polymorphisms are associated with altered expression of both genes. Although the cellular function of either of the proteins encoded by these genes is unknown, the genetic observations suggest that they must play an important role in asthma patho-genesis. Furthermore, the observation that this genetic locus has been associated with a number of chronic immune-mediated disorders such as ulcerative colitis, type 1 diabetes, primary biliary cirrhosis, and Crohn’s disease suggests a common mechanism may operate in these conditions. The recent observation that Orm family proteins mediate sphingolipid homeostasis and regulate endoplasmic reticulum-mediated Ca\\n2+ signalling suggests \\na new avenue to explore pathogenic mechanisms in asthma.\\nGene–environment interaction\\nIt is clear that allergic diseases, as is the case for all complex genetic disorders, arise from the interaction between individuals’ genetic susceptibility and their cumulative environmental exposures during the life course (Fig. 2.3). A range of inhaled and ingested envi -\\nronmental factors have been hypothesized to contribute to the development of allergic disease, including aller -\\ngens, diet, respiratory viruses, air pollutants, environmen -\\ntal tobacco smoke, endotoxin, and occupational exposures. \\nFig. 2.3  Gene–en vironment interactions in the pathogenesis of asthma.

A number of genes have shown consistent association with atopy phenotype, for instance genes related to theTh2 immune response such as IL-4, IL-13, IL-4 receptor-α (IL4RA), and STAT6.\\nMore recently, the use of the genome-wide association \\napproach has provided significant insights into the genetic basis of an atopic predisposition per se. For example, a GWAS analysis of 1530 individuals to identify loci associ -\\nated with serum IgE levels and allergic sensitization showed strong association between functional variants in the gene encoding the alpha chain of the high-affinity receptor for IgE ( FCER1A) on chromosome 1q23 and \\nboth of these phenotypes. In addition this study also confirmed previous candidate gene studies that impli -\\ncated variants in both STAT6 and the genetic region on \\nchromosome 5q31 that contains the genes encoding the typical Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. The exact causal polymorphism at the locus is unclear as there have been multiple polymorphisms identified in the promoters of both genes that regulate their transcriptional levels. In addition, both of these genes together with the nearby cytokine gene IL5 appear to be coordinately regulated, \\nthrough the actions of regulatory locus control elements extending into the adjacent RAD50 gene.\\nAnother atopy-related phenotype to be examined using \\na GWAS approach is blood eosinophil counts. In an Ice -\\nlandic population, polymorphism in proinflammatory cytokine genes, including IL1RL1 and the gene encoding \\nthe Th2-promoting cytokine IL-33, alongside those that encode molecules regulating haematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation such as MYB, were \\nshown to be associated with base-line blood eosinophil counts.\\nAs might be expected, loci identified in both these \\nstudies are also associated with disease phenotypes involving Th2-mediated immunity or a role for eosi -\\nnophils. For example, in the Icelandic population several of the loci associated with blood eosinophil levels were also associated with asthma and myocardial infarction. Variation within the IL4-IL13 locus has long been recog -\\nnized as being associated with a wide range of atopy and independent of inheritance of other traits. It uses common genetic polymorphisms that are known to influence expo -\\nsure patterns (such as availability of dietary nutrients such as vitamin E or D) or have effects equivalent to those produced by modifiable exposures (such as raised blood cholesterol concentration). Associations between genetic variants and outcome are not generally con-founded by behavioural or environmental exposures. Thus if a genetic factor that modulates exposure to the environment [e.g. apolipoprotein E (apo E) for choles -\\nterol or vitamin D receptor polymorphisms] modulates the effect of the exposure on outcome, it strengthens casual inference for the exposure of interest. The utiliza -\\ntion of a mendelian randomization approach is likely to be of value in the future for increasing evidence for cau-sality for a range of environmental exposures shown to be associated with increased risk of allergic disease, from farm exposure and diet to aeroallergen and air pollution exposure.\\nFor example, pattern recognition receptors such as \\nCD14 and T oll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) are involved in the recognition and clearance of bacterial endotoxin (LPS), by activating a cascade of host innate immune responses. Single nucleotide polymorphisms alter the biology of these receptors and could influence the early life origins of asthma, when the immune system is developing. Poly -\\nmorphisms in CD14, TLR4, and other T oll-like receptor genes have been shown to modify the associations with risk of developing atopy and asthma, particularly in the presence of country living and farm milk consumption or household LPS exposure. Such studies indicate that the protective effect of rural lifestyle may be, in part, deter -\\nmined by the effect of early LPS exposure on the devel -\\noping immune system.\\nStudies assessing the effects of air pollution on asthma \\nsusceptibility have found variable results. However gene–environment studies of polymorphisms in genes encoding metabolizing enzymes such as the glutathione-S- transferase genes ( GST) have shown that these also influ -\\nence the effects of ambient air pollution on asthma risk during childhood, particularly when controlled for levels of ozone and diesel exhaust particles.\\nSupporting evidence for a direct effect of prenatal \\nacetaminophen exposure during pregnancy on subse -\\nquent risk of childhood asthma and wheezing has recently been provided by the observation that the effects of the exposure are modified by maternal (thus excluding con -\\nfounding of postnatal exposure) polymorphisms affecting oxidant responses (a plausible biological response to acetaminophen).\\nThus future identification of the factors that influence \\nvariability to environmental exposure would help to iden -\\ntify at-risk groups who would benefit most from preven -\\ntive strategies. This identification of at-risk groups, the degree of their sensitivity to exposure, and their fre -\\nquency in the population will aid in the cost–benefit ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 50}),\n"," Document(page_content='What is known about the genetics of allergic disease\\n 2\\n41with disease. In order to prioritize which of the several \\ngenes at this locus as candidates for further functional studies, the association of the diseases associated SNPs with gene expression has been examined and this has implicated both the ORMDL3 and GSDMB genes. \\nImportantly, many subsequent studies in multiple ethni -\\ncally diverse populations have now replicated the associa -\\ntion between variation in the 17q21 genomic region and childhood asthma. Other asthma susceptibility genes identified using GWAS have included the phosphodieste -\\nrase 4D (PDE4D) gene, involved in airway smooth muscle contraction, the gene TLE4 on chromosome encoding a \\ntranscription factor implicated in cell fate decision and boundary formation, and DENND1B, a gene that is \\nexpressed by natural killer cells and dendritic cells and encodes a protein that interacts with the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α) receptor. Most recently, the \\nGABRIEL study, which undertook genome-wide associa -\\ntion analysis of 10  365 cases and 16  110 controls, not only \\nconfirmed a role for the chromosome 17q21 locus but also highlighted a number of genes involved in inflamma -\\ntory responses such as IL1RL1 and IL18R1, members of \\nthe interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor family on chromosome 2, and the genes encoding the Th2-promoting cytokine IL-33 (IL33) and the SMAD3 intracellular signalling protein. In occupational asthma, researchers using GWAS to identify the determinants of asthma in workers exposed to toluene-diisocyante identified multiple polymorphisms of the alpha-T-catenin gene (CTNNA3) as strongly associated with disease. These polymorphisms were  \\nassociated with increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), increased specific IgG to CK19, which may be an intermediate phenotype of TDI-asthma and lower CTNNA3 mRNA expression.\\nThese studies show the power of the GWAS approach \\nfor identifying complex disease susceptibility variants and the number is likely to rapidly increase in near future. However, as for other complex diseases such as Crohn’s disease and diabetes mellitus (which have been exten-sively studied using GWAS approaches), the results from studies performed to date do not fully explain the herit -\\nability of common complex disease. It is thought that this inability to find all the genetic factors underlying disease susceptibility may be explained by limitations of GWAS, such as the presence of other variants in the genome  \\nnot captured by the current generation of genome-wide genotyping platforms, analyses not adjusted for gene–environment and gene–gene (epistasis) interactions, or epigenetic changes in gene expression.\\nGenetic studies of asthma increase \\nunderstanding of disease pathogenesis\\nThe study of the genetic basis of asthma has revealed \\nastonishing insights into the pathogenesis of this complex condition. Initially, most candidate gene studies of asthma atopic disease phenotypes. This overlap between genetic variation identified as predisposing to atopy and that underlying asthma is not surprising given current under -\\nstanding of the role played by IgE and Th2-mediated immune responses in the pathogenesis of allergic disease, and studies of heritability that have suggested that genes that predispose to atopy overlap with those that predis -\\npose to asthma.\\nAsthma\\nThere are many hundreds of studies published that examine polymorphism in several hundred genes for  \\nassociation with asthma and related phenotypes such as airway hyperresponsiveness, bronchodilator response, and lung function. An increasing number of genes have been also identified as asthma susceptibility genes using hypothesis-independent genome-wide linkage, and more recently GWAS approaches.\\nPositional cloning by linkage\\nT o date, several genes have been identified as the result of positional cloning using a genome-wide scan for allergic disease phenotypes including for example ADAM33, \\nDPP10, PHF11, HLAG, OPN, NSPR1 (GPRA), UPAR, \\nand IRAKM for asthma, and PCDH1 for bronchial hyper -\\nresponsiveness. The identification of these genes, most of which had not been implicated in allergic disease previ -\\nously, has revealed the importance of utilizing hypothesis-independent approaches to identify susceptibility genes. Furthermore, unlike many candidate gene studies, the susceptibility genes identified through positional cloning have, in general, been more likely to be replicated in subsequent studies of additional cohorts. Despite the success of such positional-cloning studies, in general linkage analysis for allergic disease phenotypes has proved to be slow and expensive and the majority of studies, despite recruiting several hundred families, have proved to be underpowered to identify susceptibility genes for complex disease.\\nGenome-wide association studies\\nThere have now been several genome-wide association studies performed with great success in asthma. The first novel asthma susceptibility locus to be identified by a GWAS approach was on chromosome 17q12-21.1 (Fig. 2.4\\n). In this study, 317  000 SNPs were genotyped in 994 \\nsubjects with childhood onset asthma and 1243 non-asthmatic controls.

For example, the gene encoding the Th2 effector cytokine IL-13 is one of the genes most consistently associated with asthma and related phenotypes. Given the impor -\\ntance of Th2-mediated inflammation in allergic disease, and the biological roles of IL-13, including switching B cells to produce IgE, wide-ranging effects on epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle promoting airway remodelling, and mucus production, IL13 is a strong bio -\\nlogical candidate gene. Furthermore, it is also a strong positional candidate. The gene encoding IL-13 and early linkage studies also strongly implicated the genetic region containing the Th2 cytokine gene cluster on chromosome 5q31 as containing an asthma susceptibility gene. Several functional polymorphisms of IL13 have been character -\\nized. These include promoter polymorphisms such as the -1112 C/T variant that appears to alter transcription factor binding, and an amino acid polymorphism involving a single base pair change that results in the substitution of glycine for arginine at amino acid 131 (110 in the mature protein). This has been shown to alter the affinity of IL-13 for the decoy receptor IL13R α2, increase func-\\ntional activity through IL13R α1, and enhance stability of \\nthe molecule in plasma.\\nPolymorphism of a number of other genes encoding \\neither proteins regulating Th2 T-cell production such GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3), T-bet, the transcrip -\\ntion factor necessary for Th1 cell development (encoded by the gene TBX21), and the cytokine IL-4, its receptor \\nIL-4Rα, and downstream signal transducer STAT-6 have also all been repeatedly associated with increased suscep -\\ntibility to asthma and related phenotypes, and there is evidence that there may be a synergistic effect on disease risk in inheriting more than one of these variants.\\nAlthough studies of these biological candidate genes \\nhave increased understanding of the genetic basis of asthma susceptibility, they have not given new insight into the biological mechanisms important in asthma, as a role of the proteins encoded by these genes is well estab -\\nlished in asthma in the absence of genetic studies. However, the startling observation from genetic studies of asthma, especially genes identified through hypothesis-independent genome-wide approaches, is that genes encoding proteins involved in Th2-mediated immune responses are not the only, or even the most important, factors underlying asthma susceptibility. It is clear from heritability studies of allergic disease that the propensity to develop atopy is influenced by factors different than those that influence disease clinical manifestations of allergic disease such as asthma. However, these disease factors require interaction with atopy (or something else) to trigger disease. For example, in asthma bronchocon -\\nstriction is triggered mostly by an allergic response to inhaled allergen accompanied by an eosinophilic inflammation in the lungs, but, in some people who may have ‘asthma susceptibility genes’ but not atopy, asthma is triggered by other exposures such as toluene diisocy -\\nanate. It is possible to group the genes identified as con -\\ntributing to asthma into four broad groups ( Fig. 2.5 ).\\nFirstly, there is a group of genes that are involved in \\ndirectly modulating response to environmental expo -\\nsures. These include genes encoding components of the innate immune system that interact with levels of micro -\\nbial exposure to alter risk of developing allergic immune responses such as the genes encoding components of the LPS response pathway such as CD14 and TLR4, high-\\nlighting the importance of innate immunity in asthma. Interactions between genes and environment will be dis -\\ncussed further below. Other environment response genes include detoxifying enzymes such as the glutathione-S-transferase genes that modulate the effect of exposures involving oxidant stress, such as tobacco smoke and air pollution.\\nThe second major group is a group of genes involved in \\nmaintaining the integrity of the epithelial barrier at the mucosal surface and signalling of the epithelium to the immune system following environmental exposure. Like the role of filaggrin in the epidermal barrier (see below) genes encoding chitinases such as AMCase and YKL-40 appear to play an important role in modulating allergic inflammation and are produced in increased levels by  \\nthe epithelium and alternatively activated macrophages in patients with asthma. The gene PCDH1, encoding \\nprotocadherin-1, a member of a family of cell adhesion molecules and expressed in the bronchial epithelium, has also been identified as a susceptibility gene for BHR. IL-33, identified by both candidate gene and genome-wide approaches, is produced by the airway epithelial in response to damage and drives production of Th2-associated cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.\\nThe third group of genes is those that regulate the \\nimmune response, including those regulating Th1/Th2 differentiation and effector function as discussed above, but also others such as DENND1B, IL1RL1/IL18R\\n, \\nIRAKM, and PHF11, which may regulate the level of \\ninflammation that occurs at the end organ for allergic disease (i.e. the airway, skin, nose, etc.).\\nFinally, a number of genes appear to be involved in \\ndetermining the tissue response to chronic inflammation such as airway remodelling. They include genes such as ADAM33, which is expressed in fibroblasts and smooth muscle, PDE4D in smooth muscle (and inflammatory \\ncells) and SMAD3, regulating an intracellular signalling \\nprotein that is activated by the profibrotic cytokine TGF-β.\\nThus, genetic studies have shown that variation in  \\ngenes regulating atopic immune responses arise not the only, nor even the major, factor in determining suscepti -\\nbility to asthma.

(a, b) Group 1: sensing the environment. The group of genes encodes \\nmolecules that directly modulate the effect of environmental risk factors for allergic disease. For example, genes such as \\nTLR2, TLR4, and CD14, encoding components of the innate immune system, interact with levels of microbial exposure to alter \\nthe risk of allergic immune responses. Polymorphisms of glutathione-S-transferase genes ( GSTM1, GSTM2, GSTM3, GSTM5, \\nGSTT1, and GSTP1) have been shown to modulate the effect of exposures involving oxidant stress, such as tobacco smoke \\nand air pollution on asthma susceptibility. Group 2: barrier function. A high proportion of the novel genes identified for susceptibility to allergic disease through genome-wide linkage and association approaches has been shown to be expressed in the epithelium. This includes genes such as FLG, which directly affects dermal barrier function and is associated not only \\nwith increased risk of atopic dermatitis but also with increased atopic sensitization. Other susceptibility genes, such as ORMDL3/GSDML, PCDH1, and C11orf30 are also expressed in the epithelium and might have a role in possibly regulating \\nepithelial barrier function. Group 3: susceptibility to atopy. It is clear from genome-wide studies that the genes that predispose to atopy and serum IgE responses are mostly distinct from those that predispose to atopic disease. Genes identified for atopy include FCER1A and polymorphisms in the IL4, IL13, IL5 Th2 cytokine locus on chromosome 5q31.1. Group 4: regulation of \\n(atopic) inflammation. This group includes genes that regulate Th1/Th2 differentiation and effector function [e.g. IL13, IL4RA, \\nand STAT6; TBX21 (encoding T-box transcription factor); and GATA3], as well as genes such as IL33, IL1RL1, DENND1B, IRAKM, \\nPHF11, and UPAR that potentially regulate both atopic sensitization and the level inflammation that occurs at the end-organ \\nlocation for allergic disease. This also includes the genes shown to regulate the level of blood eosinophilia ( IL1RL1, IL33, \\nMYB, and WDR36). Group 5: tissue response genes. This group includes genes that modulate the consequences of chronic \\ninflammation (e.g. airway remodelling), such as ADAM33 and PDE4D, which are expressed in fibroblasts and smooth muscle, \\nand COL29A1, encoding a novel collagen expressed in the skin linked to atopic dermatitis. Some genes can affect more than \\none disease component. For example, IL13 regulates atopic sensitization through IgE isotype switching but also has direct \\neffects on the airway epithelium and mesenchyme, promoting goblet-cell metaplasia and fibroblast proliferation.

This conclusion has only been reinforced by GWAS studies such as the GABRIEL study described above, in which the majority of asthma susceptibility loci identified were not associated with serum IgE levels.\\nDevelopment in early life and asthma\\nAnother area in which genetic studies of asthma have reinforced observations from traditional epidemiology is in the importance of early life events in determining asthma susceptibility. A number of genetic studies have now provided evidence to support a role for early life developmental effects in allergic disease. For example, ADAM33 was identified as an asthma susceptibility gene using genome-wide positional cloning. The observed posi -\\ntive association between polymorphisms in this gene and asthma susceptibility and BHR, but not with atopy or serum IgE levels, coupled with the selective expression of ADAM33 in airway smooth muscle cells and fibrob -\\nlasts, strongly suggests that alterations in its activity may underlie abnormalities in the function of these cells criti -\\ncal for both BHR and airway remodelling. As in adult airways, multiple ADAM33 protein isoforms exist in human embryonic lung when assessed at 8–12 weeks of development, and polymorphism in ADAM33 is associ-\\nated with early life measures of lung function (sRaw age 3). Whilst replication studies are awaited, this finding suggests that variability in this gene is acting in utero or \\nin early life to determine lung development. A recent replication study of the association between SNPs on chromosome and asthma showing that the association was observed only in individuals who developed early onset asthma (≤4 years of age), has also provided further support for a critical early life period for the development of asthma.\\nAtopic dermatitis\\nAs with asthma, a genetic basis for atopic dermatitis (AD, eczema) has long been known as a complex trait with disease susceptibility involving the interactions between multiple genes and environmental factors. Heritability studies support a role for both genetic factors related to atopy in general and also for disease-specific AD genes, the risk of AD in a child being much greater if one or both parents have AD, compared with one or both parents having asthma or allergic rhinitis.\\nAgain, as for asthma there have been a large number of \\nstudies of the genetic basis of AD using both candidate gene and hypothesis-independent positional cloning and genome-wide association approaches. A recent (mid 2009) comprehensive review of genetic studies of AD found more than 100 published reports on genetic  association studies investigating 81 genes, in 46 of  \\nwhich at least 1 positive association with AD was demonstrated.\\nAlthough the majority of studies have examined poly -\\nmorphisms in genes related to atopic immune responses, more recently a number of studies have investigated genes encoding proteins involved in the epidermal  \\nbarrier. This has been prompted by the identification of the gene encoding filaggrin (FLG), which has a key role in epidermal barrier function, as being one of the strong -\\nest genetic risk factors for AD. Filaggrin (filament-aggregating protein) is a major component of the protein–lipid cornified envelope of the epidermis, which is important for water permeability and blocking the entry of microbes and allergens. The filaggrin gene FLG \\nis located on chromosome 1q21 in the epidermal differ -\\nentiation complex. In 2006, it was recognized that loss-of-function mutations in this gene caused ichthyosis \\nvulgaris, a skin disorder characterized by dry flaky skin and a predisposition to atopic dermatitis and associated \\nasthma. The mutations in FLG appear to act in a semi -\\ndominant fashion, with carriers of homozygous or com -\\npound heterozygous mutations (R501X & 2282del4) having severe ichthyosis vulgaris  whereas heterozygotes \\nhad milder disease. The combined carrier frequency of null filaggrin mutations is approximately 9% in Caucasian populations.\\nSubsequently, it was recognized that individuals hetero -\\nzygous (carrying one copy) for these null alleles had a significantly increased risk of atopic dermatitis, and also atopic sensitization and asthma, but only in the presence of atopic dermatitis. It has been estimated that, although FLG null alleles are relatively rare in the Caucasian popu -\\nlation, they nevertheless account for up to 15% of the population-attributable risk of atopic dermatitis, with penetrance estimated to be between 40 and 80%; meaning that between 40 and 80% subjects carrying one or more FLG null mutations will develop AD. The increased risk of atopic sensitization and atopic asthma in the presence of AD suggests that, by conferring a deficit in epidermal barrier function, FLG mutation could initiate systemic \\nallergy by allergen exposure through the skin and start the ‘atopic march’ in susceptible individuals. This has been confirmed by the analysis of the spontaneous reces -\\nsive mouse mutant flaky-tail ( flt), whose phenotype has \\nbeen shown to result from a frame-shift mutation in the murine filaggrin gene. T opical application of allergen in mice homozygous for this mutation resulted in enhanced cutaneous allergen priming and resultant allergen-specific IgE and IgG antibody responses.\\nAs well as candidate gene studies, both positional \\ncloning by linkage and GWAS have been used to identify genes for AD in a hypothesis-independent manner. Although a number of family based genome-wide linkage scans have been undertaken for AD, the only gene identi -\\nfied by this approach has been that encoding the novel ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 55}),\n"," Document(page_content='The genetic basis of allergy and asthma2\\n46\\npossible to predict those atopics at risk of developing \\nsevere reactions to allergens in the future, allowing  \\ntargeting of preventative treatments such as allergen immunotherapy.\\nThe clinical utility of greater \\nunderstanding of allergic disease \\ngenetics\\nThe revolution in molecular genetics in the past two \\ndecades has seen the dawn of an era that has been dubbed ‘genomic medicine’, where increased understanding of the interactions between the entire genome and non-genomic factors that result in health and disease results in new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to common multifactorial conditions. Apart from increased under -\\nstanding of disease pathogenesis, there are a number of other ways in which greater understanding of the genetic basis of allergic disease will improve diagnosis and treat-ment in the future.\\nPredicting disease\\nThe major hope for studies of the genetic basis of common disease is that discovery of the genetic risk factors for disease would lead to accurate risk prediction for indi -\\nvidual patients, leading to targeting of preventative thera-pies. It is already routine for a surrogate measure of heritable risk to be used to aid diagnosis in clinical prac-tice, namely family history, and this has been shown to have some validity. However, attempts to develop scores to predict common disease based on genetic risk factors have shown that these currently show relatively poor discrimination and add little to clinical risk scores that incorporate family history, even in diseases where a greater degree of information is available from GWAS than is currently the case for allergic disease. This simply reflects the complex interactions between different genetic and environmental factors underlying common diseases, resulting in the predictive value of variation in any one gene being low, with a typical genotype relative risk of 1.1–1.5. In the future, identification of further risk factors that explain a larger proportion of the heritability of the disease, and the development of better methods for incorporating genetic factors into risk models, are likely to substantially increase the value of genotypic risk factors. The final clinical utility of any genetic test will depend on its sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values, and whether there are any possible interventions, their cost and potential benefits to the patient. Other considerations that will need to be addressed include patients’ understanding of the benefits and risks of, and attitudes towards, the use of genetic testing, adequacy of collagen, COL29A1, which provides further support for the notion of a genetically determined deficit in epider -\\nmal barrier function underlying AD. More recently, a study using a GWAS approach a SNP adjacent to a gene of unknown function ( C11orf30 encoding a nuclear \\nprotein EMSY) on chromosome 11q13 was identified as being strongly associated with susceptibility to atopic dermatitis. This locus has previously been identified as a susceptibility locus for Crohn’s disease, another disease involving epithelial inflammation and defective barrier function, and increases in copy number of the C11orf30 \\nlocus have been reported in epithelium-derived cancer of the breast and ovary. T ogether this suggests that the 11q13 locus represents another gene for an allergic disease that acts at the mucosal surface rather than by modulating the level or type of immune response.\\nAtopic rhinitis\\nAt the present time, little is known about the genetics of atopic rhinitis. Whereas familial aggregation has been observed in genetic epidemiology studies, genetic studies have been limited. Several genome-wide linkage studies have identified potential disease susceptibility loci but no genes underlying rhinitis have been positionally cloned to date. A number of candidate gene studies for rhinitis have shown association between polymorphisms in inflamma -\\ntory genes such as IL13 but the majority of these studies \\nhave been limited in size. It remains to be seen whether genetic susceptibility to rhinitis involves specific genetic factors that are distinct from those underlying suscepti -\\nbility to atopy and asthma.\\nFood allergy and anaphylaxis\\nAlthough it is clear from heritability studies that propen -\\nsity to allergic reactions to food has a heritable compo -\\nnent, the precise genetic factors underlying this have been comparatively underresearched compared with other allergic diseases. Candidate gene studies have shown evidence for polymorphisms of CD14, signal \\ntransducer and activator of transcription 6 ( STAT6), \\nserine peptidase inhibitor kazal type 5 ( SPINK5)1, and \\nIL1011 being associated with susceptibility to food allergy. Recently, a study of Japanese patients with food allergy and anaphylaxis showed that functional SNPs  \\nin the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, pyrin domain containing 3 ( NLRP3) gene, which encodes a protein \\nthat controls the activity of inflammatory caspase-1 by forming inflammasomes, were strongly associated with susceptibility to food-induced anaphylaxis and aspirin-intolerant asthma.

This is a simplistic view and readily contradicted by observations such as steroid-resistant asthma and the limited efficacy of biologics tar -\\ngeting individual T-cell surface receptors and cytokines in asthma (e.g. CD25, IL-5, IL-13 or TNF- α). Although \\nindividual patients may benefit from such therapies, they form only a small subgroup of the whole disease spec -\\ntrum. Thus the concept is emerging of subphenotypes of asthma driven by differing gene–environmental interac -\\ntions. In the future, understanding of individual genetic susceptibility may allow better targeting of therapeutics to those patients most likely to respond.\\nEqually, understanding of the genetic factors that drive \\nasthma severity may allow identification of those who are most likely to develop severe persistent disease and hence targeting of preventative treatments. The identification of ‘severity genes’ in allergic diseases such as asthma is difficult owing to the complex interactions between  \\nsusceptibility, environment, and treatment. However, a number of studies have identified genetic variations that are associated with measures of asthma severity such as the SNPs in the gene encoding the cytokine TNF- α. \\nIdentification of a panel of markers of severe disease may in the future allow targeting of healthcare resources to those individuals who are likely to exhibit the greatest morbidity and mortality.\\nPharmacogenetics\\nPharmacogenetics is the study of genetic influences on interindividual variability in both therapeutic and adverse response to therapies. The study of pharmacogenetics holds out the possibility that clinicians will be able to select prospectively the most appropriate therapeutic strategy for an individual patient based not just on their symptoms, but on their propensity to respond or suffer adverse effects as ascertained by their individual genetic make-up. It is clear from both anecdotal clinical experi -\\nence and large clinical trials that, in asthma, patient response to drugs such as bronchodilators, corticoster -\\noids, and antileukotrienes is heterogeneous. A number of studies have investigated whether polymorphism in can-didate genes may account for some of this interpatient variability.\\nNaturally occurring polymorphisms in the β\\n2-\\nadrenoceptor gene (ADRB2) may alter the function and ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 57}),\n"," Document(page_content='The genetic basis of allergy and asthma2\\n48\\ntraffic pollution, results in a dose-dependent increase in \\nperipheral blood DNA methylation.\\nThe effect of epigenetics has been observed over more \\nthan just a single generation.

The term ‘epigenetics’ refers to biological processes that regu -\\nlate gene activity but do not alter the DNA sequence itself. Epigenetic factors include modification of histones (the structural protein complexes around which DNA is coiled) by acteylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, and DNA methylation. Modification of histones regulates transcription, altering levels of protein expression. DNA methylation involves adding a methyl group to specific cytosine (C) bases in islands of CpG in the DNA to sup -\\npress gene expression. Importantly, both changes to his -\\ntones and DNA methylation can be induced in response to environmental exposures such as tobacco smoke and alterations in early life environment (e.g. maternal nutri -\\ntion). Furthermore, DNA methylation patterns are herit -\\nable, providing a mechanism for transgenerational effects of environmental exposures on disease risk.\\nThere is increasing evidence as to the importance of \\nepigenetic factors in allergic disease. For example, a number of studies have linked altered birth weight and/or head circumference at birth (proxy markers for mater -\\nnal nutrition) with an increase in adult IgE levels and risk of allergic disease.

However, as demonstrated in a broad range of prospective birth cohort studies, some of which have now tracked populations for over 20 years, it is much more common for these diseases to appear initially in a mild form during child-hood. Indeed, particularly in the case of allergy, the transient appearance of IgE against ubiquitous environmental allergens in early childhood is so fre -\\nquent within the overall population that it can be classed as ‘normal’ and it is only in a small subset of children that these responses fail to resolve spon -\\ntaneously and instead persist and consolidate, leading to clinically significant symptoms. It is also becoming increasingly evident that this period in early life represents a unique potential ‘window of opportunity’ for modulation of these responses before they become persistent. There is accordingly wide-spread interest in definition of the underlying regulatory mechanisms at play within the immature immune system at this time, as these constitute poten -\\ntial therapeutic targets. Moreover, it is also evident that, although atopic sensitization is an important risk factor for diseases such as asthma, only a small proportion of atopic individuals develop persistent asthma, which infers that other important cofactors are involved that operate against the back -\\nground of atopy to create atopic disease. These and related issues are dis -\\ncussed in the review below.\\nAetiology of respiratory allergy: \\ndevelopment of sensitization versus \\ntolerance to environmental allergens\\nAnimal model studies\\nSensitization to aeroallergens has traditionally been ascribed to a failure in \\nimmune exclusion barriers operative at mucosal surfaces, in particular secre -\\ntory IgA.

It is interesting to note that the \\ndefinition of ‘clinically relevant sensitization’ based on IgE \\ntitre is of limited value in this age range if the interna -\\ntional standard cut-off of 0.35  kU/L IgE is employed, as \\ntitres below this are significantly associated with disease risk. Moreover it has been observed that an apparent threshold exists in relation to time-dependent fluctua -\\ntions in IgE titres and risk for persistent sensitization, notably ≥83% of children whose anti-house dust mite \\n(HDM) IgE titres exceeded 0.20  kU/L by their second \\nbirthday progressed to clinical sensitization by age 5 years.\\nTh-cell studies\\nIgE antibody production by plasma cells is dependent on provision of IL-4/IL-13 signals from type 2 (Th2) memory cells, and it is the priming of these cells that represents the initiating step in the allergic sensitization process. In multiple studies dating back to the 1980s the presence of Th cells putatively responding to in vitro allergen expo -\\nsure via proliferation and/or cytokine production has been reported in cord blood. This has led to widespread suggestions that initial Th-cell priming may occur in utero via transplacental leakage of allergen from the maternal circulation. In apparent support of this proposition a recent study employing a high-sensitivity IgE assay has detected what is claimed to be fetal-derived specific IgE at low level in cord blood, implying in utero initiation of the priming/sensitization process. However, additional evidence from prospective follow-up studies demonstrat -as opposed to the exception, and the normal outcome is the development of a form of immunological tolerance (‘inhalation tolerance’). This process is mediated by pop -\\nulations of T-regulatory (T reg) cells, previously desig -\\nnated as suppressor T cells, and the sampling process  \\nby which such proteins gain access to the submucosal immune system involves the activity of intraepithelial dendritic cells that ‘snorkel’ through epithelial tight junc -\\ntions via extrusion of dendrites which are armed with an array of receptors to facilitate antigen binding/uptake (Fig. 3.1 ).\\nA hallmark feature of the tolerance process is the tran -\\nsient production of specific IgE during the induction phase, which, depending on the IgE-responder phenotype of the animal strains employed, can attain moderate-to-high titres prior to the final onset of tolerance. Moreover, genetic factors related to IgE-responder phenotype are important determinants of susceptibility to normal  \\ntolerance induction via either the GIT or the lung, with high-responder strains (homologues of human atopics) requiring higher-level and more sustained exposure to elicit stable tolerance. Intriguingly, respiratory viral infec -\\ntions appeared capable of interfering with this tolerance process, in particular de novo exposure to aerosolized allergen during the acute phase of infection results in sensitization rather than tolerance.\\nPrimary sensitization in humans: \\nprospective and cross-sectional \\ncohort studies\\nAntibody studies\\nThe first indications that allergic sensitization was typi-\\ncally initiated during early postnatal life came from cross-sectional studies showing that inhalant-allergen-specific IgE titres in atopic children increased progressively after infancy.

There are now several examples where this is seen to occur (see below).\\nEmerging differences associated with \\natopic risk\\nAllergy-prone individuals have recognized differences in \\nmany aspects of immune function at birth, including effector T cells, regulatory T cells (T regs), haemopoetic progenitor populations and innate cells. These altered patterns of gene expression reflect inherited genetic pro -\\ngrammes and how these have been modified by in utero events and exposures. Significant differences in magni -\\ntude and relative maturity of effector T-cell responsive -\\nness by the end of gestation have been associated with the later development of allergic disease, in particular a relative deficiency in type 1 Th-cell interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production compared with non-allergic children, and there is growing evidence that in high-risk infants (of allergic mothers) this is accompanied by differences in T reg activity. These subjects display reduced placental expression of the key regulatory gene FOXP3, as well as \\nreduced T reg numbers and function in cord blood, fuel-ling growing speculation that impaired T reg function is implicated in the development of allergic disease. Intrigu -\\ningly, the allergy-protective effect of microbial burden in pregnancy (see below) has been shown to be associated with increased T reg activity and this was mediated through demethylation of the FOXP3 promoter. This \\nfurther supports conjecture that environmental changes begin their influence on immune development during pregnancy.\\nInfluence of the maternal \\nenvironment: emerging  \\nepigenetic paradigms\\nThere is now firm evidence that environmental exposures \\nduring critical stages in pregnancy can alter gene ing persistence of these antibodies will be required to substantiate this possibility.\\nContrary evidence is also available from prospective \\nstudies on aeroallergen-specific Th-cell priming. In par -\\nticular, although several studies have demonstrated the presence of aeroallergen-specific Th2 activity in cord blood and accompanying age-dependent increases in this activity between birth and the end of infancy, more long-term studies have cast doubt on the relevance of the cord blood data. Notably, although progressively stronger cor -\\nrelations are found between cytokine responses from 6 \\nmonths onwards and corresponding reactivity at 5  years, \\ncord blood responses display no such correlations. The answer to this apparently enigmatic finding may lie in the results of studies on ‘recent thymic emigrants (RTE)’, which comprise the bulk of CD4 T cells in cord blood. These cells have functionally immature antigen receptors that interact at low affinity with a broad range of peptides (in contrast to the fine specificity of mature T cells), enabling RTE to respond in a ‘pseudo-memory T-cell’ fashion to antigens/allergens they have not previously encountered, leading to a burst of proliferation and cytokine production, terminated by apoptotic death. The function of these RTE in neonates is the subject of much debate, but in particular the question of whether these early responses bear any relationship to the subsequent development of genuine stable Th-cell memory remains unresolved.\\nFactors influencing intrauterine \\ndevelopment of immune function\\nA substantial body of work suggests a link between epi -\\ngenetic gene regulation, immunity, and physiological \\ndevelopment. Notably, perinatal differences in immune function precede the development of allergic disease, including relative T-cell immaturity as well as differences in T reg and innate cell function that are already evident at birth. These differences in gene expression at birth reflect both inherited genetic programmes and how these have been modified by in utero events and exposures. The emerging field of epigenetics provides a new frontier for understanding mechanisms underlying these gene–environment interactions. As discussed further below, there is now evidence that many of the environmental factors implicated in the rise of allergic disease (including diet, microbial infections, tobacco smoke, and other  \\npollutants) can epigenetically modify expression of immune-related genes with associated effects on immune programming.\\nPrenatal immune development\\nComplex immunological mechanisms have evolved to allow the fetal and maternal immune systems to coexist ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 63}),\n"," Document(page_content='Early life origins of allergy and asthma3\\n54\\nenvironmental changes implicated in the allergy epi -\\ndemic. Specific nutrients, including antioxidants, oli -\\ngosaccharides, polyunsaturated fatty acids, folate, and \\nother vitamins, have documented effects on immune function and have been implicated in epidemiological studies of allergic disease. Significantly, it has been shown that maternal (fish oil) supplementation in pregnancy can favourably modify the expression of T-cell maturation markers (PKCζ) towards an allergy-protective profile. In \\none of the first epigenetic models of allergic disease, maternal folic acid (a dietary methyl donor) has been shown to modify fetal gene expression epigenetically and promote experimental asthma in animals. This is consist -\\nent with preliminary reports linking folic acid supplemen -\\ntation in human pregnancy with increased risk of asthma and respiratory disease in the infants and highlights the urgent need for further studies, especially given the move towards mandatory dietary folate supplementation in some parts of the world. In summary, complex modern dietary changes appear to be contributing to the more proinflammatory conditions of the modern lifestyle. These effects also begin in uterine life and may offer important opportunities for non-invasive prevention strategies.\\nOther environmental exposures in pregnancy\\nMaternal medications including antibiotics, paracetamol, and acid reflux medications have been implicated in an increased risk of asthma and allergic disease. Pollutants including cigarette smoke, traffic exhaust, and indoor pollutants also have document effects on lung develop -\\nment, immune function, and asthma risk, with recog -\\nnized epigenetic effects. Other modern pollutants including organic products of industry and agriculture have also been recently associated with epigenetic effects, including effects on global DNA methylation patterns at the low-dose exposure found in the ambient environ -\\nment. Some of these products [including polychlorinated biphenyl compounds (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, dioxins, and phthalates] have been readily measured in breast milk, cord blood and placental tissue, highlighting the potential to influence early development. These modern exposures should remain an important considera -\\ntion in the rise of modern diseases.\\nIn summary, there is overwhelming evidence that ante -\\nnatal events play a pivotal role in setting the scene for postnatal disease development ( Fig. 3.3). Many environ -\\nmental exposures have the capacity to influence multiple aspects of immune development and predispose to sub -\\nsequent allergic disease, supporting the growing momen-tum behind notions of ‘developmental origins of disease’. Emerging epigenetic paradigms provide a new framework for understanding how these early gene–environment interactions drive vulnerability, and may also provide opportunities for disease prevention.expression and disease predisposition through epigenetic mechanisms. The placenta and the fetus are both vulner -\\nable to exogenous and endogenous maternal influences during this period. Specific maternal exposures such as microbial contact and diet, as well as cigarette smoke and other airborne pollutants, are known to modify fetal immune function and contribute to an increased risk of subsequent allergic disease. Notably, most of these factors are now known to exert their effects on immune pro -\\ngramming by epigenetically activating or silencing immune-related genes. Recent environmental change and associated epigenetic dysregulation are likely to explain a significant component of the inappropriate expression of pathways that promote allergic disease.\\nThe endogenous maternal environment\\nMaternal allergy is a stronger determinant of allergic risk and immune neonatal function than paternal allergy, sug-gesting effects of direct materno-fetal interactions in utero. Pregnancy has been shown to modify maternal cytokine production to both environmental antigens and fetal alloantigens, and allergic mothers have lower Th1 IFN-γ responses to HLA-DR mismatched fetal antigens compared with non-allergic women. These factors may affect the cytokine milieu at the materno-fetal interface and could be implicated in the attenuated Th1 responses observed commonly in infants of atopic mothers (above). Foreseeably, the rise in maternal allergy may also be amplifying the effect of other environmental changes.\\nMicrobial exposure\\nAlthough the initial focus of the ‘hygiene hypothesis’ was in the postnatal period, there is now good evidence that in utero microbial exposure can also have allergy-protective effects. In several studies, maternal environ-ments rich in microbial compounds (such as traditional European farming environments) appear to protect against the development of childhood allergic disease independently of postnatal exposure. Animal models also confirm that exposure to both pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbial strains prevent allergic airway inflammation in the offspring, through epigenetic effects. This is echoed by human studies that now also show that the protective effects of maternal microbial exposure are associated with enhanced neonatal T reg function, FOXP3 \\nexpression, and associated epigenetic effects (demethyla-tion) on the FOXP3 gene. Thus, although postnatal expo -\\nsure remains the largest source of direct microbial exposure, the effects of this important environmental influence clearly begin in utero.\\nMaternal diet in pregnancy\\nDietary changes are at the centre of the emerging  \\nepigenetic paradigms that underpin the rise in many \\nmodern diseases, and are among the many complex  ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 64}),\n"," Document(page_content='Variations in the efficiency of postnatal maturation of immune competence\\n 3\\n55evidence suggests that this maturation process proceeds \\nmore slowly in children who subsequently develop atopy.

It is now evident that the functional capacity of the adaptive arm of the immune system is heavily constrained in utero, probably to protect tissues at the feto-maternal interface from potentially toxic Th1 cytokines, which can damage placental func-tion. As a consequence Th-cell activation capacity per se is restricted, and the ability of these cells to secrete both Th1 and Th2 cytokines is reduced. In order to resist pathogens in the extrauterine environment it is necessary for the infant adaptive immune system to up-regulate these effector functions after birth, and accumulating Fig. 3.3  Gene-b y-environment interactions in the pathogenesis of allergic disease.

The increased neonatal production of \\nthese inflammatory cytokines correlates with their sub -\\nsequent propensity for Th2 adaptive responses. In the postnatal period, allergic children show a relative decline in microbial responses, so that by 5 years of age their TLR responses are significantly attenuated compared with non-allergic children. Although innate immune responses are important for host defence, excessive inflammatory responses are maladaptive and can lead to unwanted tissue damage. It is possible that the early propensity for innate inflammatory responses is a driver for Th2 cytokine production, potentially ‘tipping the balance’ during this critical period of T-cell development. What role these cytokines then have in the declining innate responses of allergic children is as yet unknown.\\nDevelopmental differences in TLR function have func -\\ntional implications for the many subsets of cells express -\\ning these receptors including DC and regulatory T cells that play critical roles in programming and controlling effector T-cell responses. Unless DC receive obligatory Th1-trophic signals from the local tissue environment during antigen processing, they are likely to induce Th2 differentiation as a default response. These signals are likely to occur with microbial exposure, which is known to evoke protective type 1 effector T-cell responses in mature individuals.asthma in which the major underlying driver is Th2 immunity.\\nDevelopment of innate  \\nimmune function\\nAlthough innate immune cells are functional at birth, the production of innate cytokines (including TNF-α, IL-1 β, \\nand IL-6) and key Th1-trophic cytokines (such as IL-12) is significantly reduced in the neonatal period, and may not achieve adult levels until late childhood. This has been attributed, at least in part, to deficiencies in the number and/or function of DC. Recent longitudinal studies show progressive postnatal maturation of micro -\\nbial recognition pathways (signalling through T oll-like receptors [TLR]2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR2/6, TLR7/8, and TLR9) in healthy non-allergic children, which cor -\\nrespond directly to the age-related maturation in adaptive Th1 responses noted in our original studies. This further suggests that T-cell development, and in particular inhibi -\\ntion of Th2 differentiation, may be driven through the innate immune system as it undergoes microbial-driven maturation.\\nNotably, allergic children show striking differences in \\nthe developmental trajectory of both innate and adaptive immunity, as well as apparent ‘dissociation’ between these functional cellular compartments of the immune system.

The rise in food allergy and other disorders of oral toler -\\nance are clear evidence that modern environments are not providing optimal tolerogenic conditions during allergen encounter. Beyond the gastrointestinal tract, exposures at other mucosal surfaces play a role in local events that contribute to disease pathogenesis. In the respiratory tract, viral infection and inhaled pollutants are important postnatal exposures that may contribute to the develop -\\nment of tissue-specific inflammation.\\nGut microflora\\nAlthough still incompletely understood, colonization is essential for normal immune development, underscoring the symbiotic relationship that has evolved over millen -\\nnia. Changes in colonization patterns with progressive \\nindustrialization have probably been a strong element of \\nthe hygiene hypothesis, with evidence of altered coloniza -\\ntion patterns and reduced diversity in children who go on to develop allergic disease. The specific immunoprotec -\\ntive effects of microflora appear to be mediated through multiple pathways within and beyond the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). This includes effects on local IgA production and induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T-cell populations. These collectively promote production of immunomodulatory cytokines such IL-10 and TGF- β, which inhibit local inflammation, \\nimprove gut integrity, and thereby reduce the risk of inappropriate systemic immune responses. A better understanding of these myriad effects of the gut micro -\\nbiota may provide avenues for the development of improved preventive and therapeutic strategies.\\nInfant diet\\nBreast milk is the first and most important early nutri -\\ntional source in the postnatal period, containing a large range of nutrients, growth factors, and immunomodula-tors such as immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, lyzozymes, oligosaccharides, long-chain fatty acids, cytokines, nucle -\\notides, hormones, antioxidants, and maternal immune cells. In animal studies the tolerogenic properties of maternal milk are mediated by CD4 + regulatory T cells \\nand are dependent on TGF- β present in maternal milk. \\nAlthough the mechanisms need further investigation, breast milk appears to assist the infant in initiating the fine balance between immunoprotection and oral toler -\\nance, and may reveal insights into the optimal develop -\\nment of a tolerogenic environment in the gut.\\nThe weaning diet also contains many immunomodula -\\ntory factors (as with maternal diet, above) that can influ -\\nence both systemic immune responses and local events in the gut. One of the most topical new areas at present is the emerging role of soluble dietary fibre and oligosac -\\ncharides. In addition to their previously recognized role The role of other innate cells, such as polymorphonu -\\nclear cells, in the pathogenesis of allergic disease is less clear. Eosinophils and basophils are the downsteam targets of the Th2 response, but there is preliminary evidence of presymptomatic differences in levels of their progenitor populations in cord blood of children at risk of allergic disease. More recent studies suggest an altered TLR expression and functional responsiveness of these neonatal CD34\\n+ haemopoietic progenitors in cord blood \\nof infants at high atopic risk. Again this suggests a role of maternal allergic status and other environmental expo-sures in utero, and that engagement of TLR pathways in early life though microbial exposure could modulate eosinophil–basophil progenitors.\\nDevelopment of Treg function\\nWith their recently recognized role in immune regulation and the suppression of maladaptive responses, T reg are now high among the candidate immunological pathways that underpin the hygiene hypothesis, as well as being prime therapeutic targets. Although these cells do appear to play a role in the suppression of established allergic responses via strategies such as immunotherapy, their role in the primary pathogenesis of disease is not clear. This is in part because these are among the most challenging cells to study. The lack of relevant lineage-specific surface markers has made them difficult to identify and isolate, and developmental studies are further hampered by dif -\\nficulties in isolating sufficient cells from the small volumes of blood available from children. As such, the develop -\\nmental studies of T reg in childhood are largely confined to thymus tissue, which show that the proportion of putative CD4+CD25+CD127lo/-FOXP3+ T reg increases with age during early childhood. Cord blood studies also show preliminary evidence of impaired neonatal T reg function in infants at high risk of allergy and those who go on to develop early allergic disease. Notably, the previ -\\nously recognized allergy-protective effects of microbial exposure in pregnancy have recently been associated with enhanced neonatal T reg function, which appears to be mediated by epigenetic effects with demethylation of the FOXP3 gene and increased gene expression (as discussed above). At this stage there are no longitudinal studies of postnatal T reg maturation.\\nRole of environmental factors in \\npostnatal development\\nAfter birth the infant remains vulnerable to the more \\ndirect effects of many immunomodulatory environmen -\\ntal exposures.

This contributes to \\nthe recognized increase in respiratory symptoms and pathology in smoke-exposed infants. The role of other indoor pollutants is less well understood. In some popula -\\ntions the use of home gas appliances has been associated with an increase risk of HDM sensitisation and subse -\\nquent respiratory symptoms, but this finding requires further investigation. At present, avoidance of cigarette smoke remains the only unequivocally recommended avoidance strategy for reducing the burden of respiratory disease.\\nDevelopment of respiratory \\nfunction in early life\\nThere is an increasing recognition that persistent asthma \\nresults from insults occurring in early childhood. An important risk factor for persistent asthma is low lung function, with most longitudinal cohort studies showing a deficit in lung function in asthmatics when it is first measured. Lung function grows along percentiles during the rapid growth period in childhood and, as such, the lung function an individual is born with is a major deter -\\nminant of lung function throughout life. The respiratory system is immature at birth and has a prolonged period of postnatal maturation. Thus environmental exposures that limit lung growth, especially during the rapid growth period in early childhood, may reduce an individual’s peak lung function and increase the risk of persistent asthma.\\nPrenatal lung development\\nLung development begins at approximately 3 weeks of gestation when the laryngotracheal grooves develops from the foregut. The primitive trachea is formed and lobar and segmental bronchi develop by the fifth week. By the end of week 14, approximately 70% of the airways tree has developed with the conducting airways fully formed down to the level of the terminal bronchioles. Major blood vessels develop in parallel with the airways. Fetal breathing movements become established during this period. By the end of the 16th week of gestation, the basic branching pattern of the airways is complete and airways are lined with columnar epithelial cells proxi -\\nmally and cuboidal cells distally. Respiratory bronchioles develop during the canalicular phase of development (weeks 17–27) and by the end of this period the respira -\\ntory acini including respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and primitive alveoli are present. T ypes I and II pneumocytes also develop during this period and lamellar bodies, the precursors to surfactant production, begin to appear in type II pneumocytes by about 24 weeks’ gesta -\\ntion. T rue alveoli appear only at about 36 weeks and promoting favourable colonization, their fermentation products (short-chain fatty acids) have newly discovered antiinflammatory properties. Earlier epidemiological studies suggested a protective link between dietary fibre and allergic conditions and preliminary allergy prevention studies suggest an allergy-protective effect of neonatal supplementation with ‘prebiotic’ oligosaccharides. This provides a strong basis for further exploring the role of dietary fibre and oligosaccharides in the promotion of oral tolerance.\\nInfant foods also contain a range of potential allergens, \\nwhich in a growing number of children are associated with manifestations of food allergy. Although these food antigens are first encountered in small concentrations in breast milk and possibly in utero, the largest exposure occurs during complimentary feeding. Under optimal conditions, immune tolerance is the default response to these harmless oral exposures. The rise in food allergy is more likely to reflect less tolerogenic conditions during allergen encounter (such as altered colonization) rather than specific changes within the allergens themselves. Early attempts to prevent allergic disease by ‘allergen avoidance’ have been unsuccessful. There has been a major recent shift in this regard for food antigens, which are seen now as potential ‘tolerogens’ that may be utilized in prevention and treatment of allergic disease. Based on these concepts, avoidance of food allergens in pregnancy, lactation or infancy is no longer recommended, and a series of new studies are now examining their role in tolerance induction.\\nIn summary, these and the many other dietary factors \\ncontinue to play an important role in shaping develop -\\nment of the immune system in the postnatal period, and may provide opportunities for promoting more tolero -\\ngenic conditions.\\nViral infection\\nDespite the declining burden of bacterial and parasitic infections, viral infection remains the most common cause of acute illness in childhood. Viral respiratory infec -\\ntion, particularly with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), is one of the strongest postnatal associations with allergic airways disease, although the complexity of this relation -\\nship has been difficult to dissect. Wheezing lower respira -\\ntory infection in the first year of life is a powerful risk factor for asthma at 6 years of age in both non-atopic and atopic children, and this issue is dealt with separately below.\\nPollutants in the postnatal period\\nCigarette smoke exposure remains of the most common noxious, yet avoidable, exposures in early childhood.

Although a full review of this area is beyond the \\nscope of this chapter, the importance of adequate nutri-tion for lung growth, especially in low-income developing countries, needs to be recognized. Recent reviews have highlighted the fact that asthmatics, as a group, have lower lung function than non-asthmatics. The extent to which this low lung function is a contributor to the devel -\\nopment of asthma or a consequence of other early life factors that predispose to the development of asthma is uncertain.\\nEarly life exposures that are recognized as risk factors \\nfor asthma and have been implicated in lower growth in lung function include: postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke, ambient air pollution, and, to a lesser extent, indoor air pollution; several of these factors can also affect lung growth in utero (see T able 3.1).

The argument as to whether early life infections damage the lungs (viral-induced effect) or whether such infections unmask vulnerable individuals (susceptible host) has not been settled. Severe viral infec-tions requiring hospitalization, especially with adenovi -\\nruses and the respiratory syncytial virus, can damage the developing lung and lead to recurrent respiratory prob -\\nlems, including recurrent wheeze in childhood.

This suggests that under -\\nlying interactions between the host response to pathogens and that to allergens may create a strong inflammatory milieu in the growing lung and airway that has a maxi -\\nmally negative impact on the subsequent development of respiratory function. This general conclusion is consistent with the recent report demonstrating that, although the overall frequency of lower respiratory tract infections is comparable in atopic and non-atopic children, the fre -\\nquency of highly symptomatic infections is considerably higher amongst the atopic individuals.\\nAn additional finding from these cohort studies is the \\nquantitative nature of the relationship between early sen -\\nsitization and early infections, in relation to risk for sub-sequent asthma development. Notably, risk for asthma development by age 5 years increases with the frequency of severe lower respiratory viral infections during the first 2 years, and for each infection frequency the asthma risk increases in a linear fashion with the concomitant titre of aeroallergen-specific IgE (Fig. 3.7).

This implies the translocation of molecular signals generated at the site of infection to the precursors of migratory leukocyte popu -\\nlations in bone marrow, and their subsequent ‘program -\\nming’ before release into the blood – a process that has been known for many years to operate during episodes of lung inflammation. Prominent amongst this expression signature is the chemokine receptor CCR2, which plays a key role in recruitment of inflammatory cells to inflamed lung, IL-13R, FcεR1ϒ, and multiple genes indicative of the ‘alternatively activated macrophage’ (AAM) pathway, and these expression patterns can be reproduced in vitro by culture of PBMC with IFN- α and/or IL-4/IL-13. \\nMoreover, flow cytometric analyses have identified strong up-regulation of expression of Fc εR1 on monocytes and \\nboth plasmacytoid and myeloid DC in blood during acute exacerbations.\\nIt is noteworthy that recent studies in mouse models \\nof respiratory viral infection have described type 1 IFN-dependent up-regulation of the high-affinity IgE receptor on DC in lungs, and also the accumulation in postinfected lung of IL-13R-bearing AAM, which can become a source of chronic IL-13 production.\\nAn additional finding was the dualistic role of type 1 \\nIFN in this process. Notably, IFN- α has been shown to \\nup-regulate expression of the gamma chain of Fc εR1 \\ndirectly – a process known to be rate limiting in relation to expression of the overall FcεR1 complex on the surface of DC. However, IFN- α also inhibits IL-4/IL-13-medi -\\nated up-regulation of FcεR1α gene activation, effectively terminating surface expression of the receptor complex.

The ensuing burst of IL-4/IL-13 production in the infected airway is sensed by myeloid precursors in bone marrow, which are needed to replenish the airway DC population that turns over very rapidly at the infection site. Under the influence of this IL-4/IL-13 signal, up-regulation of the Fc εR1 complex occurs on the surface \\nof the immature DC generated from these precursors, before their release into the circulation and subsequent trafficking to lung and airways – that is, they no longer require local type 1 IFN exposure in the airway to main -\\ntain FcεR1 expression (Fig. 3.9 ).\\nIn order to switch off this cascade, a negative-feedback \\nsignal is required in the bone marrow to inhibit IL-4/IL-13-mediated up-regulation of Fc εR1 expression, and \\nbased on the available in  vitro data this signal can be \\nprovided via the build-up of type 1 IFN itself.

In addition, although a series of epidemiological studies have suggested that atopy is the strongest risk factor for asthma, most atopic subjects (i.e. those producing IgE antibodies towards common inhalant and food allergens) are not sick and do not have symptoms of asthma or other allergic disease. Whilst these sub -\\njects may be at risk of developing allergic diseases such as eczema, food allergy, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or asthma, many atopic individuals remain asymptomatic throughout their lives. It is largely unknown which factors drive the onset of disease among atopic subjects. One of the reasons for the inconsistency of the findings on the association between atopy and asthma may be phenotypic heterogeneity. Thus, before reviewing the epidemiology of allergy and asthma and the relationship between atopy and symptoms of allergic disease, it is important to discuss the meaning of the diagnostic labels of ‘atopy’, ‘asthma’, and ‘allergy’.\\nMost epidemiological studies define atopy as a positive allergen-specific \\nserum IgE (i.e. specific IgE level >\\n0.35 kU A/L) or positive skin prick test \\n(wheal diameter ≥3 mm) to any common food or inhalant allergen. However, \\nwhen positive, these tests indicate only the presence of allergen-specific IgE, either in serum or bound to the membrane of mast cells in the skin; a size -\\nable proportion of individuals with positive allergy tests have no evidence of allergic disease. Atopy may not be a simple yes/no phenomenon in relation to onset and progression of allergic disease, and several studies have demon -\\nstrated that the level of specific IgE antibodies offers more information than the presence of IgE. It is now recognized that, amongst young wheezy chil -\\ndren, quantification of allergen-specific serum IgE may help identify those who are at high risk of subsequent development of persistent asthma. In addition, the level of IgE antibodies to inhalant allergens is associated with an increased risk of hospital admission with acute asthma in childhood, and quantification of specific IgE gives more accurate prediction of hospitalization risk than ‘atopy’ defined using standard diagnostic criteria. One of the reasons for the inconsistency of findings on the association between atopy and symp -\\ntomatic allergic disease in epidemiological studies may be phenotypic hetero -\\ngeneity within the current diagnostic label of ‘atopy’. Standard definition of atopy may encompass several different phenotypes that differ in their asso -\\nciation with clinical expression of symptomatic disease. In this conceptual framework, detectable serum IgE or positive skin tests alone do not define Epidemiology of allergy \\nand asthma\\nRebecca S Gruchalla, Adnan Custovic and  \\nErika von Mutius4\\nDEFINITION\\nThe epidemiology of allergy \\nand asthma is concerned with the definitions, determinants, and distribution of allergic disease and their prevention, management, morbidity, and mortality.\\n63', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 73}),\n"," Document(page_content='Epidemiology of allergy and asthma4\\n64\\nStrachan showed that the risk of allergic sensitization and \\nhay fever decreased with increasing numbers of siblings. This observation has been replicated in many populations around the world, but underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. The original suggestion that infection or unhygienic contact from older siblings to the index child or the mother explains the observation has not been substantiated with respect to overt infections such as hepatitis A, Helicobacter pylori, or by counts of infections \\nor antibiotic prescriptions in early life. The reverse notion that maternal atopy may result in reduced fertility and thus lower numbers of offspring has not been confirmed. The temporal changes in atopy prevalence since the 1960s are only marginally attributable to changes in family size.\\nEffects of contact with other children have been studied \\nusing daycare as proxy of exposure. Entry to daycare in atopy. Rather, they should be viewed as intermediate phenotypes of a true allergic vulnerability – that is, atopy may not be a single phenotype, but rather a sum of many atopic vulnerabilities that differ in their relationship with clinical allergy.\\nSimilarly, one of the difficulties when studying the epi -\\ndemiology of asthma may arise from the fact that asthma is not a single disease entity, but a collection of diseases presenting as a single syndrome or collection of symp -\\ntoms. Thus, wheezing may be just a final common pathway of expression of several diseases with different aetiolo -\\ngies, environmental triggers, and genetic associates. This needs to be taken into account when interpreting studies on epidemiology of allergy and asthma.\\nWorldwide prevalence of allergy \\nand asthma\\nAcross the world there is large variability in the preva -\\nlence of asthma, allergic disease, and atopy (Fig. 4.1). \\nGenerally low rates have been reported from developing countries and an elevated prevalence in western coun -\\ntries. Within the same ethnic group there is variation in the prevalence of allergic disease and atopy over time and across geographical areas. Such observations suggest an environmental component to the causation of these con -\\nditions. Conversely, there is clear familial aggregation and several genetic loci have been linked to asthma, atopy, and total IgE in genome-wide and linkage analyses. These findings strongly suggest an additional genetic compo -\\nnent, which is discussed in depth in Chapter 2.\\nThere has been a rise in the prevalence of asthma and \\nallergic diseases in the last century, as documented in many repeated cross-sectional surveys over time ( Fig. \\n4.2). This increasing prevalence has been accompanied by rising trends in allergic sensitization. Since the 1990s the prevalence of allergic diseases has peaked in regions with previously documented high prevalence, whereas an increase was recorded in several centres, mostly in low- and mid-income countries.\\nIn general, allergic sensitization increases with afflu -\\nence, both on the country and the individual level. The first medical reports described hay fever in the British aristocracy which then spread into less affluent classes of the population. T oday high socioeconomic status as assessed by parental education is still a risk factor for atopy, even in affluent countries such as Germany. In contrast, in inner-city areas of the USA poverty is related to increased rates of allergic sensitization and asthma.\\nThe ‘hygiene hypothesis’\\nFamily size, crowding, and sibship size are markers of affluence.

However, the evidence to support this notion in humans is still limited. The tools to assess the microbial diversity in the gut are just emerg -\\ning and must be adapted to use in large-scale studies enrolling hundreds of subjects. Some studies have been based on cultures of faecal material that can detect only a minority of microbes residing in the gut. Significant dif -\\nferences in faecal colonization between areas of high and low prevalence of allergic disease have been found. Inter -\\nvention studies using different combinations of probiotics and prebiotics have yielded conflicting results. Although some benefit may exist for the prevention of eczema, effects on allergic sensitization, asthma, and allergic rhini -\\ntis remain unclear. Finally, the administration of antibiot-ics may affect the gut microbiome, but in humans there is no clear evidence that the use of antibiotics antedates the new onset of allergic disease, in particular asthma. Prenatal maternal exposure to antibiotics may, however, affect the incidence of allergic disease in the offspring.\\nWhether other exposures related to unhygienic living \\nconditions affect the production of IgE antibodies towards allergens has hardly been investigated. One study in Russian Karelia revealed that water contamination with the first year of life has been shown to decrease rates of allergic sensitization and asthma in Europe, Canada, and the USA. Contact with other living creatures, in particu-lar dogs, early in life has been shown in a number of prospective birth cohort studies to protect from the development of allergic sensitization. All of these factors (crowding, daycare facilities, and dog ownership) have been associated with increased levels of environmental exposure to microbial compounds (endotoxin) and expo-sure to microbial diversity in the environment. Whether such exposures account for the protective effect associ-ated with crowding, large sibship size, daycare, and dog exposure remains to be determined.\\nThere is some evidence that infections with pathogens \\nsuch as hepatitis A, salmonella, measles, Helicobacter \\npylori, T oxoplasma gondii, herpesvirus, and mycobacteria \\nmay be inversely related to the development of allergic sensitization. However, these mostly serological assess -\\nments may reflect unhygienic living conditions rather than protective effects of infectious illnesses per se, as these diseases are more easily spread under crowded and more unhygienic conditions.

In \\nurban areas in former East Germany with high levels of SO\\n2 and total suspended particles emanating from coal \\nburning and industry, the prevalence of allergic sensitiza-tion was lower than in less-polluted urban areas in West Germany. In turn, exposure to traffic has been related to the development of sensitization, in particular pollen sen -\\nsitization, but not all surveys have confirmed these effects. Overall, the adverse effect of traffic exposure seems to be more pronounced for the incidence of asthma than for allergic sensitization.\\nNumerous cross-sectional and time-series studies have \\ndemonstrated acute changes in lung function, respiratory symptoms, and/or medication/healthcare use after short-term exposure to elevated levels of O\\n3, particulate matter, \\nNO 2, SO 2, and CO.\\nAlthough short-term exposures are probably important, \\nit is essential to look at more chronic pollutant exposures, since longer exposure periods are likely to be more rel -\\nevant to the development of long-term adverse airway effects. Akinbami and colleagues evaluated the associa -\\ntion between chronic outdoor air pollutant exposure, using 12-month average levels, and asthma outcomes in \\na large national sample of US children (34  073, ages \\n3–17) living in metropolitan areas. Using continuous models, a 5-unit increase in O\\n3 exposure was significantly \\nassociated with both having current asthma (adjusted odds ratio of 1.08; CI 1.02, 1.14) and of having at least one asthma attack in the previous 12 months (1.07; 1.00, 1.13). Although significant associations were not demon -\\nstrated with other pollutants using continuous models, when pollutant values were divided into quartiles, chil-dren residing in counties with the highest ozone and particulate matter (PM\\n10) levels were more likely to have \\ncurrent asthma and/or a recent asthma attack than chil -\\ndren living in counties with the lowest pollution levels.\\nIn addition to outdoor pollutants, indoor particulate \\nmatter, especially indoor environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), also contributes to asthma-associated morbidity. However, as recently pointed out by McCormack and colleagues, there are other sources of particulate matter indoors besides ETS. Common cooking and cleaning activities are important sources of particulate matter, as is traffic-related particulate matter that seeps indoors.\\nAllergens\\nWhilst high allergen exposure amongst sensitized indi -\\nviduals is associated with more severe disease, the rela -\\ntionship between allergen exposure and development of sensitization and asthma is much more complex. Most, but not all, studies investigating the relationship between dust mite allergen exposure and development of sensiti -\\nzation to mites have demonstrated increases in the risk mostly faecal bacteria was strongly inversely related to allergic sensitization. The impact of personal hygiene on the incidence of atopy and allergic disease in urban, west -\\nernized populations is unknown.\\nVirus infections\\nOver the last couple of decades there has been mounting evidence implicating viruses, especially rhinoviruses, as an important cause of asthma exacerbations in both children and adults. One of the earliest studies done in children to establish a link between asthma exacerbations and viral infections was performed by Johnston and colleagues in 1995 in the United Kingdom. In this study, upper respira -\\ntory viral infections were detected in 80–85% of asthma exacerbations and picornaviruses (mostly rhinoviruses) accounted for the majority of the infections. A strong correlation was observed between upper respiratory viral infections and hospital admissions for asthma, adding evi -\\ndence that viral infections play a role not only in causing asthma exacerbations, but also in causing exacerbations severe enough to warrant hospitalization.\\nIn addition to the finding that viruses are a major cause \\nof asthma exacerbations is the one that allergic sensitiza -\\ntion may be a risk factor for lower respiratory tract symp -\\ntoms with these infections. This relationship was initially demonstrated by Duff and colleagues, who found that the presence of IgE antibodies to inhalant allergens was a significant risk factor for wheezing with viral infection in children presenting to an emergency department because of wheezing. A synergistic effect of allergen sen -\\nsitization, high-level exposure to sensitizing allergen, and respiratory virus infection in increasing the risk of severe asthma exacerbations resulting in hospital admission has been demonstrated both amongst adults and amongst children, which suggests that there may be a combined effect of natural virus infection and real life allergen exposure in allergic asthmatics in inducing severe asthma exacerbations.\\nUrban lifestyle and air pollution\\nOther environmental exposures associated with urban residence such as air pollution and sedentary lifestyle have been scrutinized over the last decades. There is an ongoing debate about potential association of increasing body mass index, sedentary lifestyle, and asthma, but most studies have not found an effect on atopy. The data relating obesity and asthma are also conflicting. Although some studies have shown a positive correlation, others have not. The finding by Kattan and colleagues that obesity was associated with increased asthma symptoms and exacerbations only in females suggests that gender-specific factors may need to be considered when examin -\\ning the asthma–obesity relationship.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 76}),\n"," Document(page_content='Protective exposures in rural areas\\n 4\\n67Almost all studies reported a decreased prevalence of hay \\nfever and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis among farm children compared with non-farm children; studies that included objective measures of specific IgE antibodies (by skin prick tests or serum measurements) corroborated the findings.\\nResults relating to asthma and wheeze are less consist -\\nent. Only few studies included measures of airway hyper -\\nresponsiveness. In the Danish and the German study the prevalence of airway hyperresponsiveness was signifi -\\ncantly reduced among farm children. A Canadian survey confirmed these findings, with no studies showing an increased prevalence of airway hyperresponsiveness among children raised on farms.\\nLooking at adult farming populations, similar figures \\nhave been observed. In the European farmers study, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis was 14.0% in 20–44-year-old animal farmers compared with 20.7% among the participants in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey. Likewise, the prevalence of asthma was significantly lower among animal farmers compared with the general population. For asthma, these findings have been confirmed in Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Canada. Only the Norwegian study could not confirm a protective association between working on a farm and allergic rhinitis.\\nThe studies cited above were based on a cross-sectional \\ndesign. Only two studies have used a prospective, longi -\\ntudinal approach. In Canada, over 13  000 asthma-free \\nchildren aged 0–11 years were surveyed and the inci -\\ndence of physician-diagnosed asthma was determined prospectively 2 years later. The 2-year cumulative inci -\\ndence of asthma was 2.3%, 5.3%, and 5.7% among chil -\\ndren living in farming, rural non-farming, and non-rural environments respectively. From the multivariate analysis with adjustment for confounders, children from a farming environment had a reduced risk of asthma compared with children from rural non-farming environment, with odds ratios of 0.22 (95% CI: 0.07–0.74) and 0.39 (0.24–0.65) for children with and without parental history of asthma respectively. In Austria, 1150 elementary school children were recruited from nine different areas in 1994 and followed for 3 years. Adjusting for potential confounders, parental farming was inversely related to the prevalence and new occurrence of atopy. Furthermore, children living in a farming environment were more likely to lose their positive skin prick test during follow-up.\\nSources of protective exposures in \\nfarming environments\\nFarming practices vary between farms and between coun-\\ntries. Some investigators have attempted to identify indi -\\nvidual exposures in farm surroundings contributing to the reduction in risk of asthma and allergic diseases. Initial observations from Germany and Switzerland reported of sensitization with increasing allergen exposure. Some \\nstudies have suggested that dust mite allergen exposure may play a role in the development of asthma, but others have not been able to confirm this. For cockroach aller -\\ngens, the prevalence of sensitization is associated with the levels of exposure, and cockroach infestation is a strong risk factor for cockroach sensitization (especially in US inner-city homes).\\nContradictory findings have been reported with respect \\nto exposure to domestic pets and pet allergens. Clearly, pet sensitization is a strong risk factor for asthma, and patients with established asthma who are pet sensitized and exposed to high levels of pet allergen tend to have more severe asthma than those who are not exposed. However, it is unclear whether pet ownership is a risk factor for sensitization or is protective. Numerous studies have been published, with some suggesting that exposure to pet allergens may be protective against sensitization or development of asthma, whereas others show that cat exposure may increase the risk of sensitization. The effects of exposure to cats may differ from that to dogs (e.g. no studies have shown an increase in risk associated with dog exposure).\\nClinical outcomes reported from intervention studies \\nwhich aimed to reduce allergen exposure in early life in order to prevent allergic sensitization and asthma appear inconsistent and often confusing. Ongoing prevention cohorts have provided us with a wealth of information, but much longer follow-up is required before we can be sure that the interventions do not cause any harm, and can con -\\nfidently give any advice within the public health context.\\nOn balance, the evidence suggests that the relationship \\nbetween allergen exposure and the development of sen -\\nsitization and asthma is likely to be determined by the type of allergen, timing, pattern, dose and type of expo-sure, and other interacting factors (including genetic).\\nProtective exposures \\nin rural areas\\nA number of studies have addressed differences in the \\nprevalence of allergic diseases and atopy between urban and rural areas within one country. In China and Mongo -\\nlia, allergic sensitization rates were below or around 10% in rural areas, whereas in the big megacities Hong Kong and Ulaanbaatar atopy rates were comparable to western countries. In Europe similar strong gradients from rural to urban areas have been found in Greece and Poland. Similar urban–rural differences have been reported in Canada.

Across these studies, the protective effect of farming environments on respiratory allergies was largest when farm contact started during childhood and was sustained until adulthood.\\nOverall, the protective effect of regular visits to animal \\nhouses on respiratory allergy was largest when these visits started during the first 6 years of life. Therefore, child -\\nhood exposure seems to be of uppermost importance in the life course of allergic sensitization.\\nAssuming that farm contact during childhood is also a \\nproxy for prenatal and infant exposure provides addi -\\ntional evidence for the importance of prenatal factors on the development of asthma and allergies. One recent study among 137 university employees, of whom 36% were working with laboratory animals, indicated that those with farm contact during infancy were protected from sensitization to occupational allergens later in life. Likewise, among adults living in a rural agricultural area of Germany, occupational exposure to high-molecular-weight agents did not increase the risk of allergic sensiti -\\nzation – on the contrary, such exposure was inversely related to allergic sensitization to common allergens.\\nIt is unclear why individuals who stopped contact with \\nfarming environments do not encounter the same protec -\\ntion as those with continuous exposure. This may be an indication of a ‘healthy worker bias’, meaning that those with symptoms leave the farming environment. Although this might partly explain the effect, the strengths of the relationship and the consistency of the association across studies cannot be explained by a self-selection into farming alone. Another possibility is that farmers tend to underreport symptoms. However, as the findings are evident not only for self-reported symptoms but also for objective markers (e.g. allergic sensitization assessed by skin prick test or specific IgE), underreporting is not a plausible explanation. It is more likely that the underlying cause of the observed interaction is a complex interplay between prenatal factors, early childhood exposures and events encountered over the life course.\\nWithin childhood years the timing of exposures also \\nplays a role. The paediatric farm studies have clearly shown that infant and prenatal exposures matter. In the PARSIFAL study, the risk of atopic sensitization was influenced not only by a child’s exposure to the farming environment, but also by maternal exposure to stables during pregnancy. Moreover, immune responses in cord that children from full-time farmers had lower risk of atopic disease than children of part-time farmers,  \\nsuggesting a dose–response effect. T wo recent studies  \\nconducted outside Europe suggest that an important component of the farm environment is livestock expo -\\nsure, since no protective effect of farming was observed among children living in a primarily crop-farming region. This notion is supported by the finding of the European studies, where exposure to livestock has been identified as an important contributor to the protective farm effect. Interestingly, in the Austrian study children who did not live on a farm but had regular contact with farm animals also had less allergic sensitization (13.5 % versus 34.8%). Consumption of unpasteurized milk has been identified as a protective factor in a number of studies. As with livestock exposure, this effect was not restricted to chil -\\ndren living on a farm, but was also seen among non-farm populations consuming unpasteurized milk. A recent in-depth analysis of the multicentre PARSIFAL study in rural areas in Europe has also shown significant inverse relations of asthma with keeping pigs in addition to dairy farming and the contact with fodder for the animals (such as silage and hay).\\nEuropean studies among adult farmers also provide \\nsome evidence that the protective effect of farming on atopic diseases might be more pronounced among animal farmers, with the strongest effect among pig and cattle farmers. However, recent studies outside Europe were less consistent. In Canada, living on a farm had an overall protective effect on asthma and allergic rhinitis. T aking intensity of livestock contact into account did not make a difference with respect to prevalence of asthma or allergic rhinitis. Likewise, US farm women who worked with animals had the same prevalence of atopic and non-atopic asthma as those not working with animals. There -\\nfore, the size and extent of industrialization of farming and other differences in farming practices have to be taken into account when studying the effect of different types of farming exposure on allergies and asthma.\\nTiming of farming exposures\\nThere is increasing evidence to suggest that the effect of environmental exposures strongly depends on the timing. Throughout infancy, childhood, and adolescence, the human organism is in a constant process of development and maturation. It is conceivable that there are windows of accessibility and vulnerability towards extrinsic influ -\\nences during certain stages of development. Prenatal factors may play a significant role either through mecha-nisms acting in utero, or as epigenetic modulation of subsequent developmental trajectories. In the PARSIFAL study, the risk of atopic sensitization was not only influ -\\nenced by a child’s exposure to the farming environment, but also strongly determined by maternal exposure to stables during pregnancy.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 78}),\n"," Document(page_content='Racial disparities and asthma prevalence and morbidity in the USA\\n 4\\n69animal contact, serological markers of foodborne and oro -\\nfaecally transmitted infections, and atopy provided evi -\\ndence that these mechanisms act independently. It was \\nshown that early contact to animals increases the likeli-hood of T oxoplasma gondii seropositivity. However, early \\ncontact to farm animals was still the strongest predictor of atopy.\\nRacial disparities and asthma \\nprevalence and morbidity in \\nthe USA\\nA recent National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), \\nwhich included questions about asthma prevalence, asthma exacerbations, and asthma-related healthcare use during the period 1980–2004, found that the estimated number of persons with self-reported asthma during the previous 12 months had increased significantly from approximately 6.8 million (3.1%) in 1980 to 14.9 million (5.6%) in 1995 (Fig. 4.3). Even after 1995, it appeared that prevalence rates continued to rise. However, this is probably not the case since in 1997 the NHIS question -\\nnaire was redesigned and this redesign made it difficult to compare post-1997 data with those obtained before 1997. Despite this problem of comparing previous data with current data, the fact remained that, although overall prevalence did not increase from 2001 to 2004, it remained high during this time period (2001: 7.3%; 2002: 7.2%; 2003: 6.9%; 2004: 7.1%).\\nAlthough the asthma prevalence rates increased in  \\nboth adults and children from 1980 to 1995, the rise was more pronounced in children. During this time period, the rate for adults increased from 2.9% to 5.0%, while blood were influenced by maternal farm exposures during pregnancy.\\nMicrobial exposures\\nChildren exposed to livestock are likely to encounter higher levels of allergens, bacteria, and fungi than chil-dren without such exposure. Yet to date only few out of the many microbial exposures have been measured in farming environments. Bacterial substances such as endo -\\ntoxin from gram-negative species and muramic acid, a component of peptidoglycan from the cell wall of all types of bacteria, have been found to be more abundant in mattress dust from farm children than non-farm chil -\\ndren. Likewise, extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) from Penicillium and Aspergillus spp. is more prevalent in \\nfarming than non-farming households.\\nEndotoxin levels in dust samples from the children’s \\nmattresses have been shown to inversely relate to the occurrence of hay fever, atopic asthma, and atopic sensi -\\ntization in rural but also in urban populations. Independ -\\nently of endotoxin concentrations, increasing levels of muramic acid and a marker of fungal exposure (EPS) were associated with a lower frequency of wheezing and asthma among rural school children. Thus exposures not only to environmental bacteria but also to moulds might modulate immune responses and thereby protect against allergic diseases.\\nThis concept is in line with a study on the effects of \\nendotoxin and fungal spores on atopy and asthma in adult farmers in which fungal spores, rather than endotoxin, were inversely related to atopic wheeze. Another study among Dutch adult farmers designed a job exposure matrix (JEM) to assign individual occupational exposure to endotoxins. Using this JEM, endotoxin exposure was inversely related to self-reported symptoms of allergic rhinitis among the farmers. However, the prevalence of asthma symptoms augmented with increasing exposure, as seen with non-atopic wheeze among school-age chil -\\ndren. This study confirms an earlier case-control study among Dutch pig farmers. Although higher endotoxin levels were associated with a reduced risk of sensitization to common allergens, farmers with higher levels of endo-toxin exposure were more likely to have airway hyper -\\nresponsiveness and reduced lung function. These studies give further evidence that farming exposure might have differing effects on different phenotypes: while protect -\\ning from respiratory allergies and atopic asthma, such exposure may pose a risk for non-atopic asthma.\\nAs discussed above, foodborne and orofaecal infections \\nlike Helicobacter pylori, T oxoplasma gondii, and hepatitis \\nA virus might also protect from respiratory allergy. There -\\nfore, one explanation for the protective effect of the farming environment might be that exposure to microbial agents in the farm environment is a proxy for such infec -\\ntions.

In a large study that evaluated US inner city  \\nchildren with asthma, Rosenstreich and colleagues  \\nfound that the majority of these children were poor, primarily black or Hispanic, had a number of psychosocial problems, and had a high degree of environmental  \\nallergen reactivity. Most importantly, however, was the  \\nfinding that, of the allergen sensitivities evaluated,  \\nonly one, cockroach allergy, was related to asthma-  \\nassociated morbidity. In addition, and as importantly,  \\nwas the finding that sensitivity alone was not sufficient. Children had to be both cockroach-allergic and exposed \\nto high levels of cockroach allergen (greater than 8  U/\\ngram of dust). These children, unlike children who were not cockroach-allergic or children who were allergic but not exposed, had significantly greater unscheduled  \\nvisits for asthma, days of wheezing, nights of disrupted sleep and school days missed ( Fig. 4.4). Thus, the results \\nof this study confirmed that cockroach allergy plays a central role in asthma, especially asthma in inner-city residents.\\nFungal allergens have long been thought to be associ -\\nated with asthma morbidity. In a study done in children and young adults with asthma in the early 1990s, Alter -\\nnaria skin-test reactivity was associated with a 200-fold increased risk of respiratory arrest. This initial finding, that there may be a link between asthma and fungal allergy, was subsequently corroborated by the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP). In this study, a direct correlation between increased sensitivity to inhaled methacholine and skin-test sensitivity to Alternaria was \\ndemonstrated. In inner-city children also, a similar rela -\\ntionship between fungal allergy and asthma-associated morbidity has been shown to exist.\\nSensitivity to indoor mammalian allergens has also been \\nassociated with asthma-associated morbidity in US popu-lations. However, while sensitivity to cat or dog dander has been associated with increased bronchial responsive-ness in some children, mouse and rat allergy appears to play a more important role in children with asthma who live in the inner city. These allergens are prevalent in inner-city homes, and sensitization and exposure to  \\nthem have been associated with increased asthma symp -\\ntoms and asthma-associated unscheduled visits and hospitalizations.\\nIn addition to allergen sensitivity and exposure, other \\nfactors that have been associated with asthma morbidity in inner-city US populations include indoor and outdoor air pollution, viral infections, access to care issues, and possibly obesity.\\nAlthough the first study to suggest a link between \\nasthma exacerbations and viral infections was done by Johnson and colleagues in the UK (see Section on virus \\ninfections), there has also been evidence in the US to suggest a link between respiratory viral infections and the rate for children more than doubled (3.5% to 7.5%). From 2001 to 2003, while there was no further significant rate increase in either group, prevalence rates remained high, especially in children (8.5% versus 6.7% in adults). The most recent measurement, which is from 2007, indi -\\ncates that 9.1% or 6.7 million children in the USA have asthma.\\nEpidemiological studies done in the 1980s revealed not \\nonly that asthma and its associated morbidity were increasing in the USA, but also that they were increasing disproportionately in specific populations. Using national population-based data systems of the National Center for Health Statistics, it was found that hospitalization rates for asthma between 1965 and 1983 increased by 50% in adults and by over 200% in children, particularly in black adults and children. A study done in Maryland for the time period 1979–1982 found that the asthma hospital discharge rate for black children was three times greater than that for white children. Although this study did not specifically address the possible reasons for this dispro -\\nportionate distribution, it appeared it was due to a greater prevalence of poverty among Maryland’s black popula -\\ntion. Similarly, another study done in New York City in the early 1980s found that hospitalization and death rates among blacks and Hispanics were 3–5.5 times those seen for whites and that asthma-associated morbidity and mortality rates were highest in low-income neighbour -\\nhoods that were predominately black or Hispanic.\\nThe most recent figures available through the Centers \\nfor Disease Control and Prevention indicate that asthma-associated morbidity remains a serious health concern in US cities. In 2004, not only was the asthma death rate found to be over five-fold higher in black children com-pared with white children, but also this group of children, as well as Hispanic children, was found to have more indicators of poorer asthma control. More specifically, data obtained from the 2003–2004 four-state sample of the National Asthma Survey indicated that twice as many black children had asthma-related emergency depart -\\nment visits and hospitalizations compared with white children during that time period. Moreover, data from the same survey indicated that black children had greater short-acting β-agonist use compared with white children \\nand that significantly fewer black and Hispanic children reported using inhaled corticosteroids in the past 3 months compared with white children.\\nMultiple factors are responsible for the high asthma-\\nassociated morbidity of children living in inner cities. These include poor access to quality care, psychological \\nissues, poor understanding of the importance of con -\\ntroller medications and low adherence to these medica -\\ntions.

T o analyse this issue in more detail, Flores and colleagues examined 220 minority children who had an emergency department or inpatient ward admission for asthma. Of these children, 92% had a primary care provider, 96% had either public or private insurance and 95% had prescrip -\\ntion medications for their asthma. Despite this, only 44% of children had asthma action plans, only 17% had an asthma specialist and almost two-thirds of parents indi -\\ncated that they used the emergency department for their usual source of asthma care. When multivariate analyses were performed, two important things were noted: one, having an asthma care plan was associated with a reduced risk of asthma exacerbations and, two, having an asthma specialist was associated with a five-fold increased likeli -\\nhood of having an asthma care plan.\\nAnother study, which was conducted in the Denver \\nPublic Schools, found that the majority (90%) of children with asthma had health insurance and 92% had a physi -\\ncian caring for their asthma. However, this study too found that having a medical provider did not have a major impact on asthma control. Students who had medical providers were as likely as those who did not have provid -\\ners to report a hospitalization or emergency department visit for asthma, daytime and nighttime asthma symp -\\ntoms and rescue inhaler use.asthma. In 2002, Gergen and colleagues found that asthma symptoms and healthcare utilization in inner-city children with asthma were more pronounced in the autumn–winter season. While outdoor levels of SO\\n2 were \\nfound to be correlated with this increased asthma-  \\nassociated morbidity, the authors thought, but did not prove (due to absence of data), that the more likely explanation for this observation was the increased pres -\\nence of viral infections in these children during this time period. Indeed, subsequently it was shown that respira -\\ntory viruses, especially rhinoviruses, were associated with asthma exacerbations.\\nIn addition to the finding that viruses are a major cause \\nof asthma exacerbation is the finding that allergic sensi -\\ntization may be a risk factor for lower respiratory tract symptoms with these infections. This relationship was initially demonstrated by Duff and colleagues who found that the presence of IgE antibodies to inhalant allergens was a significant risk factor for wheezing with viral infec -\\ntion in children presenting to an emergency department because of wheezing. Subsequently, Green and colleagues were able to demonstrate a similar synergism between allergen sensitivity and viral infections in adults with acute asthma that resulted in hospitalization.\\nThe finding that asthmatics, especially atopic asthmat -\\nics, have increased airway symptoms during respiratory viral illnesses has generated much research. Studies have been focused on not only why this happens, but also how (i.e. the mechanisms responsible). Although few data exist to answer these questions clearly, recent work reveals that there may be a synergistic relationship Fig. 4.4  Morbidity among children with asthma, according to the presence or absence of allergy to cockroach allergen and \\nthe degree of exposure.

Since asthma is an episodic disease with long asympto -\\nmatic periods, not having daily reminders of the disease may cause families not to seek regular medical care but rather to seek care only during asthma crises. Since inner-city families are known to have numerous stressors in their lives, it is indeed possible that obtaining regular care for a chronic disease such as asthma takes a back seat to more pressing family needs. If further studies confirm this possibility, then implementation of disease management programmes that focus on daily reinforcement of self-management practices may lead to significantly reduced asthma-associated morbidity in inner-city populations.\\nConclusions\\nThere has been a marked increase in the prevalence of allergy and asthma in the latter part of the 20th century, seen across all ages and ranges of severity. More recent evidence suggests that this increase may have now reversed in some developed countries and in some age groups. The prevalence rates vary throughout the world, being the highest in English-speaking nations, higher in western than in eastern parts of Europe, and higher in urban than in rural parts of Africa. In developing parts of the world the prevalence continues to increase, and global differences may be getting smaller.\\nThe fundamental role of the environment is empha -\\nsized by the short time frame within which the increase in allergies and asthma occurred. The environmental changes that have occurred contemporaneously with the increase in allergies include changes in patterns of micro -\\nbial exposure in early life, family size and childcare arrangements, housing design, exposure to a number of pollutants, diet, and exercise. The increase in prevalence of allergies and asthma is probably a consequence of environmental factors increasing the risk in genetically susceptible individuals mediated through gene–environment interactions.\\nIn addition to the rise in prevalence, the increased \\nasthma-associated morbidity that has been seen, espe-cially in US inner cities, is also due to multiple factors. Most importantly, exposures to environmental allergens such as cockroach and rodent allergens, exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants, and poor access to quality healthcare are leading factors responsible for this con-tinuing severe healthcare issue.\\nSummary of important messages\\n\\ue06a Across the world there is large variability in the \\nprevalence of allergic illnesses and asthma.

Originally thought to have evolved to combat metazoan parasite infection caused by helminthic worms and ectoparasites by activating the T-helper-2 (Th2) arm of the adaptive immune response (IgE production, basophilia, eosinophilia, mast cell degranulation, IL-4 and IL-5 cytokine pro -\\nduction), this system is capable of being activated by supposedly innocuous proteins in genetically predisposed, non-parasitized individuals. Those sub -\\nstances that stimulate the production of, and bind to, IgE are usually referred to as allergens rather than antigens ( antibody generator) to distinguish them \\nfrom those routinely associated with IgA, IgG, and IgM production, and the capacity of a protein to stimulate an IgE response is referred to as allergenic -\\nity rather than immunogenicity. The host may come into contact with aller -\\ngens in either domestic or occupational settings via a number of routes, but inhalation represents the most important, although exposure due to inges -\\ntion, injection, and absorption through the skin and gut frequently occurs. The sequelae resulting from the interaction between allergens and IgE bound to mast cells and basophils via these portals underlie diseases such as rhinitis, sinusitis, asthma, conjunctivitis, urticaria, eczema, atopic dermatitis, anaphy -\\nlaxis and angioedema, allergic and migraine headache, and certain gastroin -\\ntestinal disorders (Box 5.1). As they result from the activation of the adaptive immune system, T ype-1-mediated allergic diseases result from two tempo -\\nrally distinct stages. In the first (also known as the sensitization or antibody-induction) stage, inhaled, injected, or ingested allergen is presented to the immune system by professional antigen-presenting cells (e.g. dendritic cells, B cells, basophils, and macrophages) and this, in susceptible individuals, causes plasma cells to produce IgE, which then binds to mast cells and basophils via specific receptors that interact with the Fc region of IgE such as the high-affinity Fc εRI. In the second (effector) phase, allergen interacts \\nwith receptor-bound IgE to cause mast cell degranulation, which clinically manifests within 5–15 minutes after the sensitized host is re-exposed. The degranulation process results in the release of various inflammatory mediators Allergens and air \\npollutants\\nGeoffrey A Stewart, David B Peden,  \\nPhilip J Thompson and Martha Ludwig5\\nDEFINITION\\nAllergens are antigens, usually \\nproteinaceous in nature, that sensitize the host for allergic reactions involving specific IgE and mast cells. Their sources are diverse and include house dust mite products, pollens, fungal spores, animals, drugs, and foods.\\nAir pollutants  are chemicals, \\ngases and dusts that\\ncontaminate the air we breathe. They usually arise from human activity, and have the potential to damage health. In general, they are non-allergenic but they may contribute to allergic sensitization and/or exacerbate allergic diseases. Major pollutants arise from both outdoor and indoor sources and include both gases and non-biological and biological particulates such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, diesel fumes, cigarette smoke, and microbial- and plant-derived products.\\n73Allergens', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 83}),\n"," Document(page_content='Allergens and air pollutants5\\n74\\nAllergen nomenclature\\nThe Allergen Nomenclature Subcommittee of the Inter -\\nnational Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) ( http://\\nwww.allergen.org) first introduced guidelines in 1986 to \\nfacilitate the consistent naming of purified allergens from complex sources prior to the emergence of data about their true function and structure. This committee is responsible for denominating allergens as long as they are recognized by more than 5% of an allergic population using a panel of more than five individual patients, and it also maintains an allergen reference database. With regard to denominating allergens, specific guidelines must be adhered to and details of a novel allergen must be submit -\\nted to the committee for naming. For example, using the published guidelines, the designation for the cysteine pro -\\ntease allergen Der p 1, from the house dust mite Der-\\nmatophagoides pteronyssinus , is constructed by taking the \\nfirst three letters of the genus (i.e. Dermatophagoides) \\ntogether with the first letter of the species (i.e. pteronys-\\nsinus) and combining them with an arabic numeral that reflects the order in which the allergen was isolated or its clinical importance. In the case of Der p 1, this was the first mite allergen to be isolated and characterized, as  \\nwell as cloned. If there is likely to be confusion with a previously named allergen, an additional letter may be used from either the genus or species name to avoid such a possibility. For example, the fungal alkaline serine pro -\\ntease allergen from Penicillium chrysogenum is designated \\nPen ch 13 to distinguish it from the related allergen Pen c 13 from Penicillium citrinum. Similarly, the allergen \\nfrom Candida albicans is designated Cand a 1 to dif -\\nferentiate it from the dog allergen Can d 1. Allergens from different species within a genus or across genera use the same numbering arrangement. For example, the related mite cysteine protease allergens from the species D. farinae and Euroglyphus maynei are referred to as Der \\nf 1 and Eur m 1, respectively. Collectively, such related allergens are often referred to as belonging to a particular group (e.g. the ‘Group 1 mite allergens’). With the sig -\\nnificant increase in the amount of sequence data gener -\\nated owing to the adoption of cloning and whole-genome sequencing technologies, it is apparent that a particular allergen source may contain a number of allergens with sequences that are very similar ( >67% sequence identity \\nusing the IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Subcommittee guidelines). In this case, such allergens are described as isoallergens and are given a suffix ranging from 00 to 99 (e.g. Amb a 1.01, Amb a 1.02). In situations where similar allergens are described but differ only in the occa -\\nsional residue (polymorphism), these are described as variants, and an additional two digits are used in the description (e.g. Amb a 1.0101 – the first variant of the isoallergen Amb a 1.01).(see elsewhere in this book) that give rise to the charac -\\nteristic features of T ype-1-mediated allergic disease. At both stages, it is assumed that allergens breach innate defence barriers such as skin and internal gut and respira -\\ntory epithelial layers to facilitate interaction with IgE-sensitized mast cells and thus initiate disease.\\nMost of the clinically important allergens have now \\nbeen cloned and several genomes of allergen sources sequenced, and thus their biological function within a source determined. Many are hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases, carbohydrases, ribonucleases, and enzymes involved in pectin degradation from mites, fungi, and pollens, or non-hydrolytic enzymes such as pectin lyase from herbaceous dicotyledon and tree pollen, the glyco -\\nlytic enzymes from fungi such as enolase, alcohol dehy -\\ndrogenase, aldolase and phosphoglycerate kinase, and glutathione transferases from cockroach and dust mites. Similarly, many show enzyme-inhibitory activity or dem -\\nonstrate marked sequence homology to known inhibitors, and are commonly found in seeds, potatoes, pollens, and hen’s egg white. Many others are proteins involved in the transport of ligands such as lipids, pheromones, electrons, oxygen, and iron, particularly the lipocalin allergens from animals such as rodents, dogs, cows, and horses. Some allergens have been shown to be similar to a disparate but ubiquitous group of proteins known or considered to possess regulatory properties. These proteins are also encountered as allergens in pollinosis, parasite infection, and autoimmunity, and include profilins, the EF-hand calcium-binding proteins, the cytoskeletal protein tropo-myosin, and heat-shock proteins. Although their regula -\\ntory properties are varied, many appear to be associated with actin biology such as is seen with pollen tube growth. The production of these proteins by recombinant tech -\\nnologies has now made it possible to determine the three-dimensional structures of a large number of clinically important allergens as well as determine the structure and location of B-cell and T-cell epitopes ( Fig. 5.1 ).Box 5.1  A llergen sources and allergic diseases\\nAsthma and/or \\nrhinitis Anaphylaxis Atopic dermatitis\\nAnimal danders Biologicals Bacteria\\nCockroaches Food allergens Dust mites\\nDust mites Insect venoms Food allergens\\nFood allergensFungiLow-molecular-\\nweight drugsHuman \\nautoallergen\\nGrass pollen Biologicals Occupational \\nallergens LatexOccupational \\nallergens\\nTree pollenWeed pollen', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 84}),\n"," Document(page_content='Factors influencing allergenicity\\n 5\\n75thought to be related to the fact that the human immune \\nsystem has evolved a specific set of innate immune rec -\\nognition receptors that respond to unique pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs, e.g. peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, DNA, RNA). These PAMPs tend to stimulate Th1 rather than Th2 responses via the stimula -\\ntion of dendritic cell IL-12 production and thus drive an adaptive immune response down a non-IgE-producing pathway. Alternatively, it is possible that early life expo -\\nsure to bacteria results in immune tolerance to associated proteins. The capacity of allergens to stimulate IgE in humans is influenced by properties that will also influence the production of IgG, IgA, and IgM to any immunogen. These include size, solubility, foreignness (i.e. amino acid sequence dissimilarity with human homologues), concen -\\ntration, and route of exposure (Box 5.2). In addition, data are now acumulating that suggest intrinsic factors other than those described above may influence allergenicity Factors influencing allergenicity\\nIntrinsic factors\\nSo far, there does not appear to be any one inherent molecular or biological characteristic that determines whether a protein is destined to be allergenic. Most aller -\\ngens are proteins or glycoproteins with molecular masses \\nin the range 5000–100  000  Da and are derived from \\nsources such as arthropod faeces, foods, parasite secre-tions, fungal spores, and plant pollens. Interestingly, few allergens from commonly encountered bacteria have been described apart from the enterotoxins produced by sta -\\nphylococcal species associated with atopic dermatitis, although this might reflect a special case as they are superantigens and capable of non-specifically activating adaptive immune responses including those involving IgE. The reason for the dearth of bacterial or viral allergens is Fig. 5.1  Allergenic B-cell and T-cell epitopes on allergens.

Some of these \\nproperties, particularly physicochemical, may also influ -\\nence the site at which an allergic reaction will manifest. \\nFor example, some individuals may be allergic to specific food components, but do not manifest symptoms when the food is cooked because the IgE-binding (B-cell) epitopes are dependent on a precise conformational arrangement of amino acids (conformational epitopes), which are altered by heat. However, if the epitopes are resistant (non-conformation-dependent, linear epitopes) or uncooked foods are ingested, then symptoms may be manifest in the oral cavity and/or the gut. Although the majority of allergens are proteinaceous, glycan moieties, for example, the terminal disaccharide galactose- α-1,3-\\ngalactose structure (see Fig. 5.1), commonly found on \\nsome non-primate glycoprotein allergens, may also stimu -\\nlate the production of specific IgE, particularly those Box 5.2  F actors that influence allergenicity\\nIntrinsic Extrinsic\\nBiochemical activity Adjuvants\\nConcentration* Birth weight\\nForeignness Cigarette smoke\\nGlycosylation\\nMolecular complexity (size)Genetic predisposition \\nand gender\\nResistance to cooking Hygiene\\nResistance to digestion Pollutants**\\nRoute of exposure Season of birth\\nSolubility Viral infection\\n*Allergen concentration may influence sensitization or tolerization.\\n**See later section for the influence of pollutants on allergens and \\nallergenicity.\\nTable 5.1  A summary of the potential consequences of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors and properties of \\nallergens/allergen sources\\nProperty Cell/molecular interaction Possible consequence\\nExtrinsic\\nHigh focal allergen Epithelium Increased permeability due to osmotic shock, \\nconcentration influencing allergen entry and \\npresentation\\nPollen lipid Epithelium Adjuvant activity, increased allergen \\nmediators presentation due to effects on dendritic cells (DC), eosinophils and polymorphonuclear cells\\nPollutants such as diesel exhaust \\nparticulates and environmental \\ntobacco smokeEpithelium Carrier of allergen into lower lung, adjuvant \\nproperties, epigenetic effects\\nReactive oxygen species Epithelium Increased permeability, influencing allergen \\nentry\\nIntrinsic\\nGlycosylation Macrophages, DC, surfactant \\nproteins A, DIncreased antigen presentation, DC activation and T-cell polarization\\nOligomerization Antigen-presenting cells such \\nas DC and macrophagesIncreased allergenicity\\nProtease activity Epithelium Increased permeability, influencing allergenentry due to apoptosis, mast cell degranulation, kinin production and tight \\njunction protein degradation\\nProinflammatory cytokine release (IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF) due to interaction with protease activated receptors (PAR)Up-regulation of cell surface molecules, \\nincreasing cell recruitment/decreasing \\nactivation potential\\nBasophil Activation and presentation of allergen', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 86}),\n"," Document(page_content='Factors influencing allergenicity\\n 5\\n77from seafood, plant- and animal-derived foods, and \\ninsects. Interestingly, IgG antibodies to this epitope are present at high concentration in most humans owing to its ubiquitous presence on glycoproteins from foods and microbes. In addition to the above, data are emerging that suggest that the propensity of an allergen to form dimers or oligomers may also determine how effectively aller -\\ngens interact with IgE bound to mast cells, thus triggering degranulation. This might be an important characteristic of relatively low-molecular-weight allergens, where the small number of potential epitopes may limit the capacity of a monomeric allergen to cross-link the two or more allergen-specific IgE molecules necessary for the mast cell activation process. In this regard, multimers of various allergens from pollen, mites, foods, and danders have been described (T able 5.2). Finally, data suggest that allergens possessing glycan moieties may be taken up specifically by dendritic cells in the respiratory mucosa either directly via C-type lectins such as the mannose receptor and the dendritic cell-specific 1CAM3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) receptor or indirectly via their interaction with surfactant protein D present in respira -\\ntory fluids (see T able 5.1). Such interactions may bias \\nallergen-specific T cells towards a Th2 phenotype.\\nExtrinsic factors\\nA number of extrinsic factors, both endogenous and exog -\\nenous, may also contribute to the recognition of potential allergens by the immune system by altering normal homeostatic defence mechanisms, for example, genetic factors, climate change, industrial pollutants, cigarette \\nTable 5.2  Allerg ens known to exist as multimers in nature\\nSource Allergen\\nInvertebrates\\nBee Api m 4\\nCockroach Per a 3\\nFire ant Sol i 2\\nHouse dust mite Der p 1, Der p 5\\nWasp venom Ves v 5\\nPlantsPollens Phl p 1, Phl p 5b, Phl p 7, \\nPhl p 11 sa, BGP-2, Bet v 1\\nSeeds Ara h 1, Ara h 2\\nVertebrates\\nDanders Fel d 1, Equ c 1\\nMilk Bos d 5smoke, or viral infections (see subsequent sections in this \\nchapter; T able 5.3). For initial sensitization to occur, the \\ngenetic characteristics of the host are important, not only in influencing clinical progression but also in influencing the induction of IgE per se as well as allergic responses to specific allergens. For example, genes associated with innate immunity and immunoregulation are likely to play very important roles owing to their ability to influence allergen entry, recognition, presentation, and IgE induc-tion. With regard to allergen entry, the innate immune function of the epithelial barrier is emerging as being particularly important in sensitization, given recent find-ings showing loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin protein in patients with atopic dermatitis. This protein plays an important role in the stratum corneum, particu -\\nlarly in the formation of microfibrils comprising the keratin cytoskeleton. Originally described as playing a significant role in skin lesions, mutations associated with allergic sensitization and asthma in this group of patients have been identified, suggesting a role for percutaneous allergen exposure. In addition to genes associated with barrier function, genes encoding the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility class (MHC) II complex pro -\\nteins also play a role. These cell surface proteins present allergen-derived peptides (about 13–24 amino acids) to T-helper cells to initiate IgE production and they have been shown to influence the presentation of allergens derived from a number of sources including pollens and low-molecular-weight occupational allergens such as the polyisocyanates (see elsewhere in this book). For example, IgE production to the olive pollen allergens Ole e 2  \\n(profilin) and Ole e 10 (1,3- β-glucanase) in certain indi-\\nviduals is associated with the expression of HLA DR7 and DP2, and HLA-DR2 on their antigen-presenting cells. As the size of an allergen increases, however, and therefore the number of potential epitopes increases, such associations becomes difficult to discern. Informa-tion on regions of the allergen (agretope) which bind to the class II molecule and the region (epitope) which binds to the T-cell receptor or IgE-combining site (parat -\\nope) is increasing rapidly owing to their potential useful -\\nness in the development of novel immunotherapeutic regimens. With regard to epitopes, data indicate that allergen-specific IgE binds to epitopes that are located on the surface of an allergen, in contrast to that seen with MHC and T-cell receptor interactions, where T-cell epitopes may be located either on the surface or buried inside the protein (see Fig. 5.1 ).\\nExtrinsic factors may also influence the spectrum of \\nallergens or concentration of individual allergens present within a particular source or, indeed, the sources them -\\nselves. For example, climate change involving rising tem -\\nperature and atmospheric CO\\n2 concentrations (in the \\ncase of pollen allergens), environmental factors influenc -\\ning available food sources for arthropods (mite and insect allergens), and pollution (pollen allergens) (see later ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 87}),\n"," Document(page_content='Allergens and air pollutants5\\n78\\nTable 5.3  Ex amples of allergen sources\\nAllergen group Examples Seasonality\\nAirborne\\nAnimal dander and urine Cat, dog, horse, rabbit, guinea pig, hamster, mouse, \\nrat, cowPerennial\\nBird feathers Budgerigar, parrot, pigeon, duck, chicken Perennial\\nCereal flours Wheat, rye, oat Perennial\\nPollens\\n Grasses Rye, couch, wild oat, Timothy, Bermuda, Kentucky \\nblue, cocksfootSpring/early summer\\n Herbaceous dicotyledonous species Ragweed, Parietaria spp., plantain, mugwort Summer/autumn\\n T rees Alder, birch, hazel, beech, oak, olive, cyprus, cedar Winter/spring\\nHouse dust and storage mites Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, D. farinae, Euroglyphus maynei, Blomia tropocalis, Acaris siro, Tyrophagus putrescentiaePerennial\\nInsects Cockroach, fly, locust, midge Perennial/seasonal\\nFungi Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium spp., Alternaria spp., \\nCandida spp. Pencillium spp., Malassezia spp.Perennial/variable\\nPlant products Latex, papain, bromelain Perennial\\nEnvenomated\\nInsects Bee and wasp stings, ant and mosquito bites Summer\\nOrally administered and injectable\\nDrugs Penicillins, sulphonamides and other antibiotics, \\nsulphasalazine (sulfasalazine), carbamazepine, \\nchimeric (human/mouse) monoclonal antibodiesNon-seasonal\\nFood Seafood, legumes, tree nuts, sesame, cereals, milk, eggs, fruits, mushrooms, alcoholic beverages, coffee, chocolateNon-seasonal\\nsections of this chapter) have all been shown to influence \\nthe spectrum of allergens to which individuals might be exposed. Similarly, concentrations of plant-derived aller -\\ngens within a particular cultivar may be influenced by environmental or cultivation conditions. Such changes have the potential to influence whether an allergen mani -\\nfests as ‘major’ or ‘minor’ in a population, although not diagnostically problematic as long as all relevant allergens are represented in any reagent used to detect allergy. In addition to these extrinsic factors, others derived from the allergen sources themselves may act as adjuvants or proinflammatory agents. For example, pollen-associated lipid mediators (PALM), NADPH oxidases and cysteine and serine proteases may contribute to allergenicity. In this regard, PALM (e.g. phytoprostanes) may modulate dendritic cell function whereas the oxidases and pro-teases may influence epithelial integrity or stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines (see T able 5.1).Origins of allergens\\nMost individuals are exposed to mixtures of allergens rather than to single proteins. This is because they most often come into contact with allergen-rich ‘containers’, in contrast to the animal danders, pollen submicronic particles, and occupational allergens. Such ‘containers’ include arthropod faeces (enclosed by a peritrophic membrane), and pollen grains and fungal spores, where the complex array of allergens contained therein play major physiological roles such as in digestion (faeces) and somatic growth and fertilization (fungal spores and pollen). Reflecting their role in the natural environment, many of the allergens in these containers rapidly leach out of their particulate structures when they become hydrated on contact with mucosal surfaces. The most complex sources of allergens are domestic, and include fungi, pollen, and mites, with the least complex being ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 88}),\n"," Document(page_content='Origins of allergens\\n 5\\n79these arbitrary divisions do not necessarily indicate that \\nminor allergens will be clinically insignificant in certain individuals. Allergens in domestic settings are sometimes referred to as ‘indoor’ or ‘outdoor’ allergens to reflect the origin of the allergen source. T ypical outdoor allergens include pollens and fungi, whereas indoor allergens include animal dander, fungi, and mite and insect faeces (see T able 5.3). Exposure to an allergen source may result \\nin the production of allergen-specific IgE in genetically predisposed people, but it is also possible for such indi -\\nviduals to manifest allergic reactions to either similar (e.g. pollen versus pollen) or dissimilar (e.g. snail versus house dust mite) sources to which they have been exposed. This occurs because both the similar and/or the dissimilar sources contain allergens that are structurally and func-tionally similar and thus share a high degree of amino acid sequence homology or, in the case of the carbohydrate epitope galactose-α-1,3-galactose, are present in the glycan component of dissimilar glycoproteins. This sequence similarity will increase the likelihood of allergen-specific IgE produced against one allergen recognizing the animal dander and urine extracts, as are the occupational sources (see T ables 5.4 and 5.5). Up to 60% of the pro-\\nteins from a given source are allergenic and a sensitized patient may recognize more than one allergen from within a source as well as allergens from multiple sources. With regard to source, patients are described as being mono- or polysensitized, and there are data suggesting that mono -\\nsensitization is more frequent with house dust mite allergy than with pollen, food, and animal danders, and with milk rather than hen’s egg, nuts, and wheat. Fur -\\nthermore, cosensitization to airborne sources appears more frequently in patients with cow’s milk and soy allergy, and cosensitization to food is relatively infrequent in those with allergy to house dust mites and dog dander. The precise number of allergens recognized within a source reflects both the genetic capability of the host, the complexity, and concentration of the source, and the assay used to determine allergenicity. The more fre -\\nquently recognized proteins ( >50%) within an allergic \\npopulation exposed to the same source are termed ‘major allergens’, in contrast to ‘minor allergens’.

The exine is constructed from sporopollenin over which lies the pollen coat comprising lipids and proteins. Inside the pollen grain is the cytoplasm that contains various structures including nuclei, mitochon -\\ndria, plastids containing starch granules (amyloplasts), and P (polysaccharide) particles. The clinically important pollens will vary according to geographical location, as well as season and microclimatic conditions, and may be indigenous or introduced ( Fig. 5.2). Pollens from anemo -\\nphilous plants are also characterized by their buoyant density, which contributes to their ease of dispersion and profusion, and grains from individual species may vary in \\nsize, ranging from 5 to over 200  µm. Pollen release is \\nusually seasonal, with late spring and summer represent -\\ning the most important pollination seasons ( Fig. 5.3), and \\nthe temporal sequence of pollination is usually trees, grasses, and herbaceous dicotyledons. The daily atmos -\\npheric concentration of pollen will vary during the pollen season and may be reduced by rain and falls in ambient temperature. The number of pollen grains required to provoke disease will vary from species to species but  \\nthat required to initiate symptoms at the beginning of the hay-fever season is likely to be greater than at the end owing to stimulation of the immune system, and may range from 20 pollen grains/m\\n3 upward. For example, for \\ngrass pollen sensitivity, 50 grains/m3 may be sufficient but \\n400 grains/m3 may be required for olive-pollen-allergic \\npatients. In addition to pollen grains per se, some plants \\nalso produce pollen-related orbicules (0.2–1  µm), which \\narise from the pollen-forming process in the anther and consist of exine material and possibly allergens. For example, gymnospermous trees such as Crypotomeria \\nspecies and Cupressus species, and the herbaceous same epitope in the other source. This phenomenon is known as ‘allergenic cross-reactivity’, and such cross-reactivity may be extensive, particularly in small but physiologically essential allergens, where extensive genetic mutations in the encoding genes cannot be toler -\\nated. This type of extensive cross-reactivity between allergens from diverse sources gives rise to the term ‘pan-allergen’ and is usually associated with low-moleculer-weight, relatively minor allergens such as the profilins, polycalcins, and non-specific lipid transfer proteins found in pollens and fruit sources.\\nAirborne allergens\\nPlant allergens\\nPollens (from the Greek for ‘fine flour’) are the male gametophytes of flowering plants and gymnosperms, and represent some of the more clinically important allergen sources (10–20% of community allergic disease); the most common disease presentation is rhinitis. The major allergenic pollens (grasses, herbaceous dicotyledons, and trees) are derived from wind-pollinated (anemophilous) rather than insect-pollinated (entomophilous) plants, and pollen seasons may last for several months. The anemo -\\nphilous pollens, in contrast to those from insect-pollinated plants, possess a thin, complex and chemically resistant exterior cell wall that has two main layers: the inner intine layer lying next to the plasma membrane and the outer exine layer, which may be highly sculptured. An additional layer, the Z-layer, lies between the intine and exine and is thickest at the germination pore – the opening \\nFig. 5.2  Selected worldwide distribution of clinically important pollen allergens.

The pollen allergens from the different grass species were originally divided into groups on the basis of marked physicochemical and immunochemical similarities, and this scheme has now been adopted for similar allergens derived from sources other than grass pollen. Grass pollen allergens demonstrate various functions associated with cell wall synthesis/remodelling, fertilization, and pollen tube growth and include expansins, extensins, ribonucle-ases, glucosidases, protease inhibitor-like proteins, calcium-binding proteins, and profilins ( Appendix 5.1). \\nIn addition, enzymes involved in the breakdown of the plant cell wall necessary for pollen tube growth, such as pecate lysase and polygalacturonase, are also allergenic. Pectin degradation involves a number of enzymes working in concert and the grass pollen allergen types, together with the pectin methylesterases, are also significant aller -\\ngens in herbaceous dicotyledons and tree pollens.\\nHerbaceous dicotyledonous species pollen\\nThe principal allergenic herbaceous dicotyledons (some -\\ntimes referred to as weeds because they represent unwanted plants within a garden or field) are those belonging to the Asteraceae, such as ragweed, mugwort, sunflower, and feverfew, as well as wall pellitory belong -\\ning to the Urticaceae. Several allergens from each of dicotyledonous Parietaria species, produce orbicules that \\ncontain allergen but the angiosperm tree species Betula \\nverrucosa does not. Pollen allergens may be found in the pollen coat associated with the exine, but the majority reside within the cytoplasm per se or are associated with specific structures therein, such as the starch granules or P particles. These particles are released through the ger -\\nmination pore ( Fig. 5.4) when whole pollen lands on \\nmucosal surfaces in humans. Allergens may also leach out through microchannels in the exine. A significant number of the allergenic proteins released from the pollen coat and cytoplasm are hydrolases involved in cell wall syn -\\nthesis and pollen tube growth as well as helping the pollen tube breach the cell wall of the ovule so that fertilization may occur (see Appendices 5.1 to 5.3). The pollen grain \\nand the orbicules are considered the primary sources of allergen, but studies show that individuals may be exposed \\nto submicronic particles (0.5–2  µm in diameter) derived \\nfrom the grains themselves. For example starch grains  \\nand P particles are released from pollen after rain and then become airborne as the environment dries out, and therefore become capable of triggering allergic disease. As pollen grains are too large to penetrate into the  \\ndeeper airways, it is likely that submicronic particles  \\ncarrying allergens infiltrate the lower bronchi, conse-quently provoking asthma in 2.5–10% of susceptible individuals.\\nGrass pollen\\nGrasses, which comprise part of the major plant group, the monocotyledons, are significant contributors to pol -\\nlinosis globally because of their wide distribution and Fig. 5.3  P ollen seasons in USA, Australasia, and Europe.

This may take several weeks, in contrast to the short time taken for pollen tube growth in the woody and herbaceous angiosperms, and once in contact with the nucellus a small pollen tube is formed, which then penetrates the ovule.\\nNon-pollen, plant-derived aeroallergens\\nA number of aeroallergens have been described that are derived from non-pollen plant tissue such as seeds and \\nlatex (Appendices 5.4 and 5.6 ). They are a significant \\nsource of allergens in occupational settings in industries \\nsuch as baking and include flours prepared from wheat, barley, castor beans, mustard seed, green coffee beans, rice, cotton seed, Ispaghula, and soybeans. The major seed-derived allergens usually belong to one of several types of storage proteins, which account for about 75% \\nTable 5.5  The relationship between plant pathogenesis-related proteins and allergens\\nFamily Description or characteristics Examples\\nPR-1 Antifungal, mechanism unknown Cum c 3\\nPR-2 Endo-β-1,3-glucanase Hev b 2, Ole e 4/9\\nPR-3 Chitinases (type I, II) Pers a 1, Hev b 11\\nPR-4 Chitinases (type I, II) Turnip prohevein, Hev b 6, wheat germ agglutinin\\nPR-5 Thaumatin-like proteins, antifungal, may have \\nendo-β-1,3-glucanase activityPru av 2, Mal d 2, Jun a 3\\nPR-6 Protease inhibitor Soybean, wheat, barley, rice allergens\\nPR-7 Protease ?\\nPR-8 Chitinase (type III) Latex hevamine\\nPR-9 Peroxidase Wheat, barley allergens\\nPR-10 Plant steroid carrier Bet v 1, Mal d 1, Pru av 1, Pyr c 1, Api g 1, Dau c 1, etc.\\nPR-11 Chitinase (type I) ?\\nPR-12 Plant defensins ?\\nPR-13 Plant defensins ?\\nPR-14 Lipid transfer proteins Pru p 3, Mal d 3, Gly m 1\\nPR-15 Oxalate oxidase ?\\nPR-16 Oxalate oxidase-like ?\\nPR-17 Unknown ?\\n? indicates that allergens belonging to a particular group have yet to be described.within the same order and/or family are related; for \\nexample, in the Scrophulariales species olive, lilac, ash, and privet, the major allergens are proteins showing limited homology with known seed-derived protease inhibitors, polycalcins, and 1,3- β-glucanase (Appendix \\n5.3); in the Fagales species birch, hazel, and ash, the major allergens belong to or show homology with members of a diverse group of proteins known as pathogenesis-related proteins ( T able 5.5). These proteins, as the name \\nsuggests, are either constitutively produced or are expressed when plants are exposed to microbial attack or abiotic stresses. They comprise proteins with varied activities and, in this regard, the Fagales group 1 (e.g. Bet v 1) allergens belong to the PR10 family, members of which are likely to be involved in the transport of plant steroids such as the brassinosteroids found in pollens and play a role in pollen tube growth. Both the Fagales and Scrophulariales species produce allergenic enzymes involved in pectin degradation. Interestingly, there is limited similarity in the spectrum of allergens found in angiospermous species, compared with gymnospermous species. In the latter, enzymes involved in pectin degrada -\\ntion dominate (Appendix 5.3), and these differences are likely to reflect the proteins and enzymes important in the fertilization process.

However, Basidiomycota species (Malassezia species, mushrooms, puffballs, rusts, smuts, and bracket fungi) are also thought to represent signifi -\\ncant allergen sources in certain situations. Multicellular fungi in both phyla produce spores that are often found in very large quantities in the air. The size of spores will vary between species, ranging from 1 to >\\n100 µm \\nalthough, in general, most of the clinically important \\nspecies produce spores in the range 7–12  µm. Theoreti-\\ncally, fungal allergens should be more clinically significant because spores containing them are the most abundant airborne particles (e.g. >5,000 spores/m\\n3) and are small \\nenough to penetrate deep into the respiratory tree, in contrast to pollen grains. Meteorological studies reveal that atmospheric conditions such as wind speed, tem -\\nperature, and humidity influence the release of spores. For example, ascospores may be released after rainfall (Didymella exitialis) or hot dry conditions ( Cladospo-\\nrium), and basidiospores may be released due to humid -\\nity. Aspergillus and Alternaria spores appear to be \\nparticularly significant in asthma, but those from Cladosporium herbarum and Penicillium species may also \\nbe important. Spore concentrations required to provoke symptoms will depend on the species (e.g. 50–100/m\\n3 \\nfor Alternaria and 3,000/m3 for Cladosporium). Fungal \\nallergens are thought to be produced by both spores and/or hyphae as they develop, and are then released into the environment (Appendix 5.5). In addition to natural expo-sure, individual fungal allergens (often hydrolytic enzymes used in a variety of industries) have been shown to be allergenic (Appendix 5.6 ).\\nSeveral allergens from non-occupationally important \\nfungal species including Alternaria alternata, Cladospo-\\nrium herbarum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium species, \\nand Candida albicans have been characterized because of total seed protein or proteins involved in protection against insects due to antimicrobial or enzyme-inhibitory activities and are often denominated by their sedimenta -\\ntion coefficients (e.g. 2S, 7S, and 11S). These groupings include the cupin (vicilins and legumins) and prolamin (2S albumins) superfamilies, lipid transfer proteins, and the pathogenesis-related proteins. Some of the food aller -\\ngens such as the lipid transfer proteins appear to be highly resistant to digestion and heating, which is thought to enable them to cross epithelial barriers in relatively intact form. In addition to seeds, allergens may also be derived from other plant tissues including fruit, vegetables, and latex, which are generally important in occupational set-tings. Of significance are the latex allergens, which may become absorbed into the starch powder used as a lubri -\\ncant in latex gloves, and become aerosolized. This results in a high prevalence of allergy in healthcare workers (20%) and patients with spina bifida (50%) who are exposed to latex products during surgical manipulations. Latex, a suspension of proteins in a water phase, is pro -\\nduced in response to deliberate cutting of the bark of the rubber tree and contains a variety of enzymes, proteins, and lectins for defensive purposes (cf. the pathogenesis-related proteins). At least 13 latex allergens have now been described and include a rubber elongation factor, chitin-binding lectin, chitinase, profilin, and endo-1,3- β \\nglucosidase as well as proteins of unknown function (Appendix 5.4).\\nFungal allergens\\nFungi may be broadly divided into two groups based on their structure and include the unicellular yeasts, and the multicellular fungi that produce hyphae and spores. Although allergen-producing yeasts have been identified (e.g. Candida species, Malassezia species), most of the \\nclinically important allergen-producing species are multi-cellular. Fungi are further subdivided according to their means of reproduction and morphology. The allergenicity Fig. 5.5  Fungi commonly involved in allergic disease. (a) Aspergillus fumigatus.

In addition to the lipocalins, serum \\nproteins such as albumin and the immunoglobulins (IgG, \\nIgA and IgM) may also be allergenic, but data suggest that allergenicity to the latter is associated with the galactose-α-1,3-galactose epitope (Appendix 5.7) present in the glycan moiety of each.\\nInvertebrate-derived allergens\\nAllergy to invertebrates may arise either through domes -\\ntic or occupational contact in scientific institutions where they are reared for study, and cause allergic disease in up to a third of workers. The main arthropod allergen sources are found in the classes Insecta and Arachnida, and include chironomid midges, moths, butterflies, locusts, cockroaches, and house dust and storage mites, respec -\\ntively (Fig. 5.6). However, house dust mites and cock -\\nroaches represent two of the most clinically important allergen sources worldwide owing to their ubiquity ( Fig. \\n5.7). The clinically important species are the German (Blatela germanica) and American ( Periplaneta ameri-\\ncana) cockroaches, and the house dust mite species Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, D. farinae, Blomia \\ntropicalis, and Euroglyphus maynei. Both mites and cock -\\nroaches prefer the warm environment and food sources provided by domestic dwellings, with mites prefering to live in carpets, soft furnishings, and mattresses, and growth being dependent on temperature and humidity. The major mite and cockroach allergens are gut-derived and hence are found in faecal material ( Appendix 5.8). \\nThe spectra of allergens found in mites and insects, whilst demonstrating some overlap (e.g. the tropomyosins, tro -\\nponin C, glutathione transferases, arginine kinases, and trypsins) also reveal marked differences. For example, in the cockroach, inactive aspartate proteases, lipocalins, and insect haemolymph-related proteins ( Appendix 5.8) \\nare prominent, with mite allergenic homologues yet to be described. Similarly, many of the major mite allergens are hydrolytic enzymes involved in digestion, and include cysteine proteases, serine proteases, and amylase, whereas others are non-enzymatic with homologues in insects yet to be described ( Appendix 5.8). Allergy to mites may also \\noccur in occupational settings where foods are stored; in these circumstances, mite species such as Acarus siro and \\nA. farris, T yrophagus putrescentiae , T . longior, Glycypha-\\ngus domesticus, and Lepidoglyphus destructor  are signifi-\\ncant. However, the spectra of allergens produced by storage and house dust mites are similar. These mite species may also be found in house dust. In addition to mites and cockroaches, a number of other invertebrate-derived aeroallergens may be found in house dust and occupational settings including, for example, those from midges such as the bloodworms ( Chironomus thummi \\nthummi) and the green nimitti midge ( Cladotanytarsus \\nlewisi), and the Indianmeal moth. The major midge aller -\\ngens are the haemoglobins and tropomyosins, whereas  of their association with allergic disease as well as with aspergillosis and candidiasis. Occupationally important fungal enzymes such as amylase from A. oryzae, which is \\nadded to dough, have been shown to be potent allergens in the baking industry. In contrast to the occupational fungal allergens, the domestic fungal allergens are often enzymes associated with glycolysis or are of unknown function (Appendices 5.5 and 5.6).\\nOccupational allergens\\nOccupational allergens range from low-molecular-weight chemicals of relatively simple structure through to complex proteins and glycoproteins derived from a variety of animal, arthropod, bacterial, fungal, and plant sources. Allergy may affect only a few individuals in the workforce or up to 30% of exposed workers. The response time between exposure and symptoms may be delayed by many hours, with the consequence that the affected individual may not be in the workplace when symptoms occur, thus complicating the diagnosis. Recurrent expo-sure may lead to chronic disease with little variability being discernible, making it difficult to associate disease with exposure. A number of predisposing factors for occupational allergy have been demonstrated including prior atopic status, duration of exposure, and smoking history. Most high-molecular-weight occupational aller -\\ngens are hydrolytic enzymes, and include the bacterial subtilisins (serine proteases) and amylases used in the detergent industry, and the fungal enzymes and egg pro -\\nteins used in the baking industry ( Appendix 5.6).\\nVertebrate-derived allergens\\nVertebrate-derived allergens are of major clinical signifi-cance in domestic and occupational settings, and the inci -\\ndence of positive skin tests to such proteins in an unselected population is approximately 5%, which rises to over 30% in allergic populations. In domestic situa -\\ntions, allergy to cats and dogs is particularly common, whereas in occupational settings, allergy to rats, horses, rabbits, mice, gerbils, and guinea pigs may be prevalent. \\nThe allergens are found in dander, epithelium, fur, urine, \\nand saliva, and originate from sebaceous glands, lacrimal glands, salivary glands, anal sacks, and urine, which then accumulate on fur ( Appendix 5.7). Many of the major \\ndander allergens belong to the lipocalin superfamily, members of which are involved in the transport of low-molecular-weight hydrophobic substances in hydrophilic environments. The major cat allergen Fe1 d 1 may also be a ligand-binding protein but its true function remains unclear despite its three-dimensional structure being available. It is a non-convalent bond tetramer comprising two covalently linked heterodimers, and has been shown to exist in proteolytically truncated forms ranging in size ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 95}),\n"," Document(page_content='Allergens and air pollutants5\\n86\\nFig. 5.7  Repor ted worldwide distribution of the major house dust mite species.

However, those that are may manifest not only as gastrointestinal disease but also as neurological, cutane-ous, or respiratory disorders. In addition, IgE-mediated food allergies may also be clinically important because of their potential to induce fatal anaphylaxis. Prevalence data suggest that about 2% of adults and between 4 and 8% of children may be allergic to food, and, of the >160 \\nestimated foods linked to IgE-mediated food allergy, eight appear to be the most clinically important in that they account for >90% of all food-induced allergic reac -\\ntions. It has been estimated that food allergy, in the USA alone, accounts for 30,000 emergency room visits and  \\n150 deaths per year. IgE-mediated food allergy is diag -\\nnosed on the basis of the presence of food-specific IgE and on documented adverse reactions in double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (which are regarded as the definitive diagnostic tests). Although there will be regional and age-related effects due to diet, the most frequently occuring food allergen sources include milk, eggs, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, soy, fish, and shellfish (both crustacean and molluscan) ( T able 5.6). Most chil -\\ndren allergic to milk, eggs, and wheat become tolerized to these allergenic sources by the time they reach 5 years of age although, with regard to the remaining food groups, allergies may continue through to adulthood. This dif -\\nferential tolerance is thought to be related to the pres -\\nence of conformational epitopes within milk, eggs, and wheat sources that are more tolerizable than the linear epitope forms associated with the latter food groups.\\nThe major shellfish/fish/amphibian, bird, and mammal-\\nderived allergens are the parvalbumins and tropomyosins, the α-livetin and ovotransferrin, and immunoglobulin and \\ncasein, respectively. The plant-derived food allergens include the cupins, prolamins, profilins, and pathogenesis-related proteins ( Appendices 5.9 and 5.10 ). In addition \\nto food allergens being responsible for direct sensitization and provocation, they may also provoke symptoms in individuals who have become sensitized to aeroallergens from a variety of sources, in particular pollens ( T able 5.7). \\nSuch diseases are referred to as ‘oral allergy syndromes’ (OAS, or pollen-food syndromes) and result from aller -\\ngenic cross-reactivity (sequence similarity) between aller -\\ngens within the food and those in the aeroallergen source. OAS are usually associated with uncooked foods rather than cooked (as cooking would denature the allergens) and exposure may precipitate local (oral) or systemic reactions.\\nThe major cross-reacting plant food allergens have been \\nshown to correspond to the Fagales tree pollen Group 1 and 2 allergens, although other allergens such as the latex allergens chitinase, hevein, profilin, and Hev b 5 also cross-react. The major invertebrate cross-reacting aller -\\ngens are the tropomyosins ( Appendices 5.12 and 5.13).\\nOrally administered and injectable \\ndrug allergens\\nIgE-mediated allergy to orally administered drugs is \\nreported to occur in about 3% of the general population and is of concern, as with food, because of the possibility of anaphylaxis. It can occur with both low- and high-molecular weight drugs, although it is most frequently associated with the former. These drugs are generally characterized by the presence of a chemically reactive group enabling them to interact with host proteins to create novel epitopes that render them allergenic in sus -\\nceptible individuals. These compounds, which on their own are neither allergenic nor immunogenic, are known as haptens, and typical drugs involved in type 1 hyper -\\nsensitivity include the β-lactam antibiotics (e.g. penicil -\\nlins and cephalosporins), anaesthetics, and muscle relaxants (see elsewhere in this book). With regard to the antibiotics, the β-lactam ring is central as it is chemically \\nunstable and reacts with lysyl residues to form the peni-cilloyl epitope on cell membrane proteins. Allergic reac -\\ntions may manifest as urticaria or anaphylaxis, although the latter is usually associated with injected drugs.

Similar results have been observed with the chimeric monoclonal antibody, omalizumab, which was engineered to bind human IgE and used to treat patients with allergic disease.\\nEnvenomated and salivary allergens\\nAllergen exposure via envenomation and saliva results  from the bites and stings of certain insects. The major stinging insects associated with allergic disease include bees, wasps, hornets, and ants, which may inject many may vary from 0.7 to 10% of the general population. Allergy to high-molecular-weight drugs, usually proteins and referred to as ‘biologicals’ (e.g. antibodies targeted to specific host proteins, receptor antagonists) occurs with low frequency. For example, cetuximab, an intravenously delivered chimeric mouse–human monoclonal antibody specific for the epidermal growth factor receptor and used in the treatment of certain cancers, has been shown to induce IgE-mediated sequelae. Interestingly, most reactions occur on first exposure, suggesting prior sensi -\\ntivity. In this regard, it has been shown that the respon -\\nsible epitope is the galactose- α-1,3-galactose epitope \\nassociated with the mouse Fab region of the molecule.

Most of the autoallergens are \\nintracellular proteins and often restricted to skin, but can be found in sera complexed with IgE suggesting that they may be released – presumably due to tissue damage resulting from the disease process.\\nParasite allergens\\nParasite allergens have been demonstrated in a variety of helminthic parasites; the most studied are those from the fish parasite Anisakis simplex and the human parasite \\nAscaris lumbricoides. Allergy to the former parasite occurs because it is found in edible fish species and thus manifests as a food allergy, and to the latter because of infestation. The major allergens include a variety of pro -\\nteases and protease inhibitors, lipid-binding polyproteins and tropomyosins, which show amino acid sequence homology with tropomyosin allergens from cockroach and house dust mites ( Appendix 5.13).\\nDetection of allergen or \\nallergen-specific IgE\\nSeveral techniques have been developed to determine \\nwhether an individual is allergic to a particular allergenic source and are thus useful as diagnostic tools, in  \\ncontrast to others that have been developed for  \\nacademic purposes to determine whether a protein iso -\\nlated from a source is allergenic or to characterize IgE and T-cell epitopes; yet others have been developed for environmental-monitoring purposes.\\nIn vivo diagnostic tests\\nBefore the discovery of IgE and the subsequent develop -\\nment of serum-based immunochemical assays, the skin prick test was the principle means of determining the allergenic status of an individual. It remains a useful diag-nostic tool that is robust and easy to administer and interpret. In this assay, an aliquot of allergenic material is placed onto the forearm of the patient under investiga -\\ntion, and a needle is used to prick the skin directly below the solution such that a small amount of allergenic mate -\\nrial is introduced. Alternatively, allergen solution may be injected intradermally, although the risk of anaphylaxis is greater. In both, if allergen-specific IgE bound to mast cells is present below the epidermis, a wheal-and-flare reaction results owing to the degranulation process and appears within 5–15 minutes of allergen introduction.\\nIn vitro diagnostic tests\\nThe direct demonstration of IgE binding to a particular allergen using immunochemical methods offers some micrograms of venom at any one time. About 3% of the general population may experience systemic reactions after envenomation, and about 15–30% of individuals become sensitized after being stung, and predisposing factors may include prior allergy to inhalant allergens. Of the stinging insects, allergens from the honey bee appear to be the most clinically important, and anaphylaxis is not uncommon. The venoms from bees, wasps, hornets, and paper wasps are similar in that they contain vasoactive amines in addition to peptides and enzymes, and exten-sive allergenic cross-reactivity may occur amongst the vespid species. The most important stinging-insect aller -\\ngens are those associated with the venom from bees ( Apis \\nspecies), wasps (yellow jackets; V espula species), hornets \\n(Dolichovespula species), paper wasps ( Polistes species) \\nand ants (Solenopsis species) ( Appendix 5.11). The \\nvenoms contain a number of allergens that show homol -\\nogy with proteins associated with mammalian reproduc -\\ntion and it has been suggested that, since the allergens are derived from stingers that represent modified oviposi -\\ntors, it is feasible that the allergens may have played some ancestral role in insect reproduction. The allergens derived from stinging insects belonging to different fami -\\nlies are structurally similar and include enzymes such as phospholipase, hyaluronidase, and acid phosphatase as well as proteins of unknown function. Although the  \\nfunction of the vespid Group 5 allergens is unclear,  \\nthey demonstrate sequence similarity with the plant pathogenesis-related proteins ( Appendix 5.11). With \\nregard to biting insects, the major allergenic species are ticks, triatomines, ants, horsefly, and mosquitoes. Here, the major allergenic proteins are calycin, procalin, an 80K allergen of unknown function, an Ag5 homologue and hyaluronidase, and apyrase, respectively.\\nHuman and parasite allergens\\nHuman autoallergens\\nAutoallergy was first recognized phenomenologically in the first half of the last century when immediate wheal and flare reactions resulted from the introduction of human dander extracts into the skin of allergic individu -\\nals, although the nature of the autoallergens was unclear. The concept of autoallergy was later invigorated when autoallergens were subsequenty identified using recom-binant DNA technologies. Autoallergens are usually found in patients with atopic dermatitis and may be divided into two categories. In the first, the human autoallergens (MnSOD, ribosomal P2 protein, and profi -\\nlin) (Appendix 5.12) share significant homology with environmental allergens from pollen and fungal sources and are thus thought to be cross-reactive allergens. Aller -\\ngens in the second (Hom s 1 to 5) category do not have environmental analogues, indicating they are likely to be ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 99}),\n"," Document(page_content='Allergens and air pollutants5\\n90\\nconcentrations of allergens are mixed with aliquots of an \\nallergic serum before incubation with the matrix-bound allergen. If the soluble allergen has bound IgE in the serum, this is reflected in decreased IgE binding to the matrix. The results are expressed as the amount of aller -\\ngen required to give 50% inhibition of maximum binding and, when comparing similar extracts, the lower the con -\\ncentration required the more potent it is. In addition, the slope of the inhibition curve obtained gives information regarding the range of allergens contained within an extract and this technique is regularly used in allergen standardization.\\nQuicker and more efficient variants of AST s have \\nemerged and include, for example, biochips based on microarray protein technology. Here, small spots of aller -\\ngen are bound to activated glass slides and then treated with sera as described above, and bound IgE is detected using fluorescent-dye-labelled anti-IgE. The advantage of this technique lies in its ability to determine whether a patient is allergic to one or more sources using single chips containing a large panel of individual allergens with \\nminimal amounts of serum (20  µL). Whilst these AST advantages over skin tests because of the ease of automa -\\ntion, standardization, and efficiency. All such assays use immobilized allergens and sensitive methods for detect -\\ning IgE that has bound, and are known collectively as allergosorbent tests (AST). In these assays, allergen is immobilized on an insoluble matrix such as plastic, cel -\\nlulose nitrate, cellulose (paper), or agarose beads and incubated with sera from patients under investigation. Any specific IgE antibody present will bind to the immo -\\nbilized allergen and, after washing away non-bound serum proteins, can be detected by antibody directed against human IgE. The first tracer used to detect IgE was \\n125I \\nbut this has now been replaced by enzyme tracers such as β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase. The amount \\nof IgE binding with the latter is then determined by measuring the amount of chromogenic product released (Fig. 5.8) using an appropriate, colourless substrate system. Clearly, the quality of the allergen used to attach to the matrix will be important and either whole extracts or single, purified allergens (the latter tests are known as component-resolved assays) can be used. AST s may be easily converted to inhibition assays, where varying \\nFig. 5.8  Outline of the steps involved in allergosorbent and allergosorbent-inhibition assays (a).

Here, allergen(s) is conjugated to a cellulose nitrate strip as a band upstream of an application point comprising an absorbent pad fixed at one end of the strip. This pad also contains an anti-IgE antibody conjugated with colloidal gold and when a liquid sample (e.g. blood) under inves -\\ntigation is applied to the pad, this reagent is solubilized and any IgE (or IgG) in the sample will bind to the anti-IgE colloidal gold conjugate. Both will then move up the strip by capilliary action. As the complex moves up the strip, it will come into contact with the immobilized band of allergen and any IgE specific for the allergen will become immobilized at this point, while any other IgE will continue to move along the strip. With time, the accumulated complex of IgE bound to allergen becomes visible owing to the pink colour of the colloidal gold attached to the anti-IgE. Such assays usually include a control band of antibody situated above the original capture antibody that recognizes excess anti-IgE-colloidal gold conjugate. In addition to being used diagnostically, this assay may also be modified to detect allergen in dust (e.g. from house dust mite) or in foods (e.g. soybean). In such situations, the anti-IgE-colloidal gold conjugate is replaced by an anti-allergen conjugate and the capture reagent is an antibody directed against the antibody raised against the allergen in question. In addition to these immunochemical assays, it is also possible to detect allergen-specific IgE using an in vitro cell-based assay based on the degranulation of basophils in whole blood. Here, whole blood is incubated with putative allergen, which will activate any allergen-specific IgE bound to the Fig. 5.9  Basophil activation assay for the \\ndetection of allergen-specific IgE.

In this regard, B-cell \\nepitopes are detected by synthesizing small, overlapping \\npeptides representing the entire length of an allergen and attaching them to a matrix and incubating them with sera from an allergic individual as described above in the AST section. In this way, it is possible to ‘map’ potential epitopes and determine whether they are major (recog -\\nnized by most allergic individuals). It is also possible to use phage expression libraries in a similar fashion and these have the additional advantage that it is possible to express longer epitopes, which may enable conforma -\\ntional epitopes to be expressed and detected. T o detect T-cell epitopes, use is made of the proliferative capacity of T cells bearing the appropriate cell surface T-cell receptor. Here, overlapping peptides are incubated with antigen-presenting cells and T cells, and cell proliferation is then determined.\\nAllergen isolation\\nIndividual allergens are usually isolated from aqueous extracts prepared from the original allergenic source material. As most allergens are protein or glycoprotein, any of the physicochemical techniques available for iso -\\nlating proteins in general (e.g. gel filtration, ion exchange, reverse phase chromatography) can be used, including monoclonal antibody technology. More recently, recom-binant DNA technology has become the method of choice for the characterization and production of aller -\\ngens for diagnostic, structural, and functional studies and, in this regard, many of the clinically important allergens have now been cloned.allergic serum. IgE binding to individual allergens is then visualized using a labelled anti-IgE reagent ( Fig. 5.10). \\nImmunoblotting provides information about the total number of allergens in an extract recognized by a sensi -\\ntized individual as well as their apparent molecular weights. This technique is often used to determine the frequency of reactivities to allergenic components within an allergen extract. If this is the desired outcome, aliq -\\nuots of the extract are separated in each lane of the gel and, following immunoblotting, each lane is incubated with serum from a different individual in the study popu -\\nlation. In two-dimensional electrophoresis, the allergen extract is first subjected to isoelectric focusing in poly -\\nacrylamide gels containing ampholines, which separate proteins on the basis of their isoelectric point (pI). The separated proteins within the gel are then subjected to SDS-PAGE at right angles to the isoelectric focusing step. The resulting gels may then be immunoblotted as described above. This technique is superior to the one-dimensional approach in its resolving ability, and has been particularly useful in separating and characterizing aller -\\ngens. In either one- or two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, protein allergens of interest may be digested in situ using trypsin and the resulting peptides identified by mass spectroscopy.\\nB-cell and T-cell allergenic epitope \\ndetermination\\nB-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes may be identified once \\nthe amino acid sequence of an allergen is known and, if the three-dimensional structure has been determined, Fig. 5.10  SDS-P AGE and immunoblotting analysis of allergen extracts (a).

The single-stranded cDNA produced is then converted into double-stranded DNA with a DNA polymerase and the resulting  \\nmaterial inserted into appropriate vectors such as plas -\\nmids using restriction endonucleases, and the genetic material amplified and cloned. The array of cDNA reflect -\\ning the starting mRNA represents the library, which is then screened to isolate the cDNA coding for the aller -\\ngens of interest. Screening may be accomplished by hybridization using oligonucleotide probes synthesized  \\non the basis of amino acid sequences obtained by con -\\nventional protein sequencing of known allergens or,  \\nalternatively, using sera from individuals allergic to the allergen source being cloned. The latter technique is used when direct sequence information of the allergens is  \\nunavailable. Here, use is made of expression vectors  \\nthat facilitate the synthesis of the recombinant allergen. Once cloned, the cDNA is sequenced and the putative amino acid data checked to see if the allergen shows homology with any protein so far sequenced. Using a variety of sequence databases, such information identifies the protein and helps determine the role played by the allergen within the original source. These techniques are also used to prepare purified allergen for diagnostic pur -\\nposes or to generate allergy vaccines based on reduced IgE reactivity but possessing relevant T-cell reactivity. This process has the potential to produce conformation-ally altered mutants that are unlikely to induce adverse reactions in sensitized individuals yet be capable of  \\nmodulating specific T-cell responses during immuno -\\ntherapy. The Allergen Nomenclature Subcommittee guidelines indicate that such recombinant allergens should be identified by placing the letter ‘r’ in front of the aller -\\ngen designation, e.g. rDer p 1 for the recombinant form of the mite cysteine protease allergen. If allergens are chemically synthesized, then the letter ‘s’ must be used, e.g. sDer p 1.\\nMonoclonal antibody techniques\\nIn monoclonal antibody (mAb) techniques, mice are immunized with the purified allergen and spleen cells, obtained a few weeks after primary and secondary immu -\\nnization, are subsequently fused with plasmacytoma cells using a fusogenic agent. Antibody-producing hybridomas that result are screened using appropriate selection  \\nchemicals and those possessing the appropriate specificity are isolated, cloned, and then used to produce antibody in large quantities. Such hybridomas represent a poten -\\ntially immortal supply of antibody that may be used to purify allergens, map epitopes, determine allergen  concentrations in the environment, and standardize the \\nconcentration of allergens within extracts (Fig. 5.12 ).\\nAllergen usage and \\nstandardization\\nAllergens, usually in the form of aqueous extracts pre -\\npared from individual sources (whole pollen, mites, fungi, \\netc.), are used diagnostically and to desensitize patients (termed ‘allergen vaccines’). Most of the available extracts used for these purposes are crude in that they contain not only allergens of interest but also irrelevant antigens. They have a finite shelf-life, and there may be wide vari-ation in potency between the same types of extract pro -\\nduced by different manufacturers. However, a number of standardized allergen extracts (Timothy grass pollen, birch pollen, dog hair/dander, Dermatophagoides pteron-\\nyssinus, and short ragweed) have been prepared under the auspices of the World Health Organization that meet appropriate requirements of potency and reproducibility for both diagnostic and immunotherapeutic purposes, and contain defined concentrations of specific allergens. Recombinant allergens are now available and are giving rise to the concept of ‘component-resolved’ diagnosis, in contrast to ‘extract-based’ diagnosis. It has been shown, for example, that tests performed using a single or a combination of a limited number of recombinant aller -\\ngens are sufficient to identify most, if not all, patients allergic to a particular source. Although recombinant allergens are available, they are not without potential problems such as poor stability, aggregation, incorrent folding, and reduced allergenicity and/or biochemical activity.\\nMonitoring allergen exposure or \\nallergen content\\nMonitoring the environment for the presence of an aller -\\ngen source or individual allergen (as a surrogate for the \\nsource per se), or determination of allergen concentra -\\ntions in food, can prove useful in a variety of situations. For example, monitoring atmospheric whole pollen con -\\ncentrations (by counting grains) can warn people at risk of seasonal allergies, as long as it is possible to distinguish between allergy-associated and non-allergy-associated species. Similarly, determining the concentration of whole mites in house dust may also be used to assess potential exposure risks. However, these approaches are not necessarily quick, or technologically simple to perform. On this basis, various immunoassays have been developed (see earlier) for domestic or occupational allergen exposure.

With regard to immunotherapy, the availa -\\nbility of recombinant allergens has now made it possible to develop novel allergen-specific modalities, particularly with patients who are monosensitized. Despite our lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms of clinical success, most have been developed on the basis that activating T cells (Th1 or regulatory T cells) without activating mast cells, or inducing allergen-specific IgG at the expense of IgE, is essential ( T able 5.9).

Airborne allergens arising from natural sources of course have a prominent role in causing and exacerbating allergic diseases, including hay fever and asthma, but the effects of pollutants resulting from human activity may also be relevant in allergy. For example, some of these pollutants may augment responses to allergens, and people with allergic diseases tend to be more susceptible to a number of key indoor and outdoor pollutants. Symptoms caused by air pollutants, particu -\\nlarly at high levels of exposure, tend to mimic symptoms of allergic diseases and, because of this, patients with atopic diseases may turn to allergists for guidance ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 106}),\n"," Document(page_content='Outdoor air pollutants\\n 5\\n97office, factory floor, city streets, and various public places \\nsuch as restaurants, bars, sports facilities, and shopping areas.

The artificial sources of outdoor pollutants can be broadly grouped as either stationary or mobile. The major stationary sources include power-generating stations, which may burn coal, natural gas, or petroleum; fossil-fuel-burning industrial plants; and various additional manufacturing facilities. In contrast, mobile sources will include the major gasoline- and diesel-fuelled vehicles.\\nFig. 5.13  Sites of absorption and deposition of inhaled \\nparticles and gases.

With regard to climatic influ -\\nences generating biological pollution, thunderstorm activ -\\nity has been associated with epidemics of asthma, in both the United Kingdom and Australia. Although the precise mechanism(s) involved remain unclear, it has been pro -\\nposed that the storm conditions promoted the release of spores from fungi such as Aspergillus species, Didymella \\nexitialis and Sporobolomyces species or the generation of \\nsubmicronic grass pollen material (e.g. starch granules, see earlier in this chapter) could be involved.\\nIndoor air pollutants\\nNon-biological pollutants\\nIndoor air pollutants, both non-biological and biological, are even more diverse than outdoor air pollutants – although, of course, many outdoor pollutants may ulti -\\nmately permeate indoors. Such indoor pollutants can arise domestically or in the workplace, and are broadly grouped by source and type ( T able 5.10). Indoor environments are, \\nof course, the principal microenvironments where expo -\\nsure to biological pollutants such as microbes and allergens and non-biological pollutants from sources such as gas-fired ranges, space-heating devices, tobacco smoke, and various VOCs will commonly occur. With regard to gas-fired ranges, ovens, and space-heating devices, all can emit nitrogen dioxide, particularly if they have continuously burning pilot lights. In addition, space- heating devices using kerosene combustion may also generate acids from sulphur present in the fuel. In the developing world, smoke from the burning of biomass fuels is a dominant contributor to personal exposure, although in developed countries properly operated woodstoves and fireplaces have little impact on indoor air quality.\\nWith regard to non-biological pollutant exposure, \\ntobacco smoking, which will create a mixture of exhaled smoke and smoke released by smouldering cigarettes, may be significant. This mixture, referred to as environ-mental tobacco smoke (ETS) will contain a range of pol -\\nlutants including fine particles, gases (including nicotine), irritants such as acrolein, and various aldehydes. Homes with smokers tend to have much higher levels of respir -\\nable particles than do those without smokers, and there is little debate that burning cigarettes significantly increase particulate matter levels in indoor airspaces. For example, a comparison of fine-mode particulates in smoking and non-smoking sections of 11 restaurants revealed that \\nareas in which smoking was permitted contained 177  µg/\\nm3 of PM versus 87  µg/m3 in areas in which smoking did \\nnot occur. As the smoking and non-smoking sections of these establishments were generally separate areas of one large indoor space, even the non-smoking section was The principal outdoor non-biological air pollutants rel-\\nevant to people with allergic diseases are typically present in complex mixtures, and evidence for the toxicity of the individual pollutants may not fully reflect the synergistic effects of the mixture. Fossil-fuel combustion typically generates particulate matter (PM) of varying sizes, some of which will be small enough to enter the lung. It also generates gases, including oxides of sulphur and nitrogen as well as carbon monoxide. The last of these impairs oxygen transport by binding to haemoglobin, although not specifically affecting people with allergic diseases. Sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides undergo chemical transforma -\\ntion to form respirable secondary pollutants such as sul -\\nphate- and nitrate-containing particles, some of which are acidic. These small particles may also possess heavy metals and organic chemicals on their surfaces, which can leach out in the airways to produce toxic effects. Sulphur dioxide, a highly water soluble gas, is efficiently absorbed in the nose and upper airways whereas nitrogen dioxide, a less soluble one, may reach the smaller airways of the lung.\\nIn areas with both heavy vehicle traffic and high levels \\nof sunlight, photochemical pollution or smog is gener -\\nated. This type of pollution is a rich mixture of oxidative chemicals, generally indexed by the level of ozone (O\\n3). \\nFirst identified in Los Angeles about 50 years ago, ozone pollution may become an increasingly widespread problem as urbanization increases, and cities become pro-gressively choked by vehicle traffic. In the USA, the problem of ozone pollution extends across the eastern portions of the country in the summer, and elsewhere affects many of the world’s ‘mega-cities’.\\nVarious point sources of pollution may also affect \\npeople with allergic diseases. For example, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which exist as gases at typical ambient temperatures, and other respiratory irritants may contaminate air in communities.\\nBiological pollutants\\nOutdoor biological pollution occurs where more specific sensitizing agents are released into the environment as a result of faulty workplace processes or marked, but tran -\\nsient, climatic changes.The best-known examples of bio -\\nlogical contamination of the outdoor environment that has impacted on allergic disease are the epidemics of asthma resulting from exposure to soybeans in various port cities in the USA and Spain. All appear to be associ -\\nated with exposure to dusts resulting from the unloading of soybeans from ships and their transfer to silos. However, due to faulty equipment, people were exposed to high concentrations of soybean allergens, in particular \\nthe 8  kDa Gly m 1 and 2 allergen (see Appendix 5.6). \\nThese exposures gave rise to sporadically occurring days of endemic asthma in New Orleans in the 1950s and 60s, in Barcelona in the 80s, and in Cartagena in the 90s.

TLR4 is a receptor for LPS derived from Gram-negative bacteria, as well as a number of host-derived molecules such as fibronectin, fibrinogen, heat-shock proteins, and hyaluronic acid generated by host cells after injury by inhaled agents, for example ozone. Recent studies demonstrate that hyaluronic acid, in part, via TLR4 signalling, can mediate host response to ozone.\\nThe role of an innate immune response to bioaerosols \\non asthma pathogenesis has been avidly studied over the past two decades. Several studies have suggested that responses to biological agents in indoor settings protects against development of atopy and asthma. However, other equally compelling studies have shown that indoor LPS levels are linked to increased airway disease in domestic and occupational settings. Further complicating this debate are reports that genetic variation in LPS response genes (CD14 and TLR4 alleles), coupled with differences in domestic or occupational endotoxin levels, result in either protection from or increased risk for airway disease.\\nOverall, it appears that domestic LPS and Gram-\\npositive microbial exposure generally protect infants from development of atopic disease. However, in persons who have developed allergic airway disease, exposure to LPS exacerbates asthma. Likewise, people working in or living near hog-farming operations are exposed to bio -\\naerosols, which contain Gram-positive and -negative flora and are associated with respiratory disease over time. In domestic settings, the number of animals (dogs, cats, and evidence of rodents) and people living in the home cor -\\nrelate with the amount of LPS present and has been shown to enhance responses to inhaled allergens. In addi -\\ntion, dog owners also appear to have increased responses to other non-biogenic ambient air pollutants. T aken together, these observations suggest that PAMP exposure may directly induce disease or prime enhanced response to other pollutants or allergens.\\nHumidity\\nIndoor relative humidity is increasingly recognized as  \\nan important factor in determining asthma severity. Decreased levels of humidity are associated with decreased severity of asthma. A large cross-sectional study of fourth-grade schoolchildren in Munich, Germany identified 234 children with active asthma, with 155 of these children undergoing lung function and non-specific airway reactivity tests within a 3-year span. Dampness was associated with increased night time wheeze and shortness of breath, but not with persisting asthma. Risk factors for bronchial hyperreactivity in adolescence included allergen exposure and damp housing conditions. increased IL-13 levels in smokers compared with non-smokers. Experimental in vivo nasal challenge of human volunteers with allergic airway disease with secondhand tobacco smoke also demonstrates increased IgE-mediated response to allergen. Recent studies using both in vitro and in vivo challenge of nasal epithelial cells suggest that tobacco smoke may modify type I interferon response to viral infection. Nasal epithelial cells from smokers that were experimentally infected with influenza were found to have increased cytotoxicity, IL-6, and viral shedding compared with cells from non-smokers. Cells from smokers also produced less INF-α and IRF7 (a key tran-scription factor for the production of INF- α) than those \\nfrom non-smokers. Analysis of nasal epithelial cell pro -\\nduction of IRF7 in smokers and non-smokers of cells recovered after in vivo inoculation with live attenuated influenza virus confirmed that smokers produce less IRF7 following influenza infection. In sum, there is increasing appreciation that tobacco smoke modifies IgE-mediated response and probably decreases host defences against airway viral infection. As viral infections are the leading immediate cause of asthma exacerbation, this is an impor -\\ntant mechanism by which tobacco smoke impacts on asthma.\\nMany different non-cigarette smoking-related VOCs \\nmay also be found in indoor air and arise from building materials, furnishings, household products, office equip -\\nment, and other sources. The best known of this group of relatively low-molecular-weight chemicals is formalde-hyde and, by definition, all VOCs are gaseous at room temperature. Concentrations of VOCs are typically highest when a building is new and then decline as mate -\\nrials age, but renovations and installation of new proc -\\nesses or equipment such as printers and copiers may increase their emission. T wo other indoor pollutants, namely radon and asbestos, are carcinogens but are of no direct relevance to allergic diseases.\\nBiological pollutants\\nBiological contaminants are important components of respirable particulates, and most derive from a variety  \\nof microbial sources such as bacteria and fungi. Many of these microbial agents are characterized by the presence of cell wall components (PAMPs) such as lipopolysac -\\ncharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan. Importantly, PAMPs may evoke potent inflammatory responses in an exposed host since they are ligands for a number of receptors on host cells including airway epithelial cells, and circulating monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes, which mediate a wide variety of immunomodulatory processes. The most notable of these receptors are the T oll-like receptors (TLRs), and, although a full review of the TLRs is beyond the scope of this chapter, the role of TLR2 and TLR4 in mediating responses to inhaled environmental contaminants will be highlighted.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 110}),\n"," Document(page_content='Mechanisms of toxicity\\n 5\\n101pollutants. Although specific mechanisms of action may \\ndiffer, all these pollutants initiate inflammation at the sites of deposition. In experimental studies, pollution exposure has been shown to induce cytokine release and neutrophil influx. The effects of prolonged exposures to most pollutants are not yet well characterized, although experimental and epidemiological evidence indicates  \\nthe possibility of airways fibrosis and narrowing and air -\\nspace enlargement, which leads to reduced ventilatory function and thus to increased frequency of respiratory symptoms.Mite allergen levels were examined from homes of 70% of the asthma cohort and found to significantly correlate with dampness and bronchial hyperreactivity. However, the effect of dampness was not due to mite allergen alone because bronchial hyperreactivity remained significantly correlated with humidity, even when adjusting for mite allergen levels.\\nMechanisms of toxicity\\nThe toxicity of the various air pollutants depends on the site of deposition and the specific chemical properties of the pollutants ( T able 5.11). The site of particle deposi -\\ntion depends largely on the size of the particles, which is usually expressed as the aerodynamic diameter ( Fig. \\n5.15). The larger airborne particles – those above approx-\\nimately 10  µm in aerodynamic diameter and referred to \\nas PM10 – do not penetrate into the respiratory tract, and particles of size PM10 down to PM2.5 are filtered in \\nthe upper airway. Particles less than 2.5  µm in diameter \\ncan enter the lower respiratory tract, whereas the smaller \\nparticles – those under 1  µm in diameter – deposit in the \\nsmall airways and alveoli.\\nWith regard to chemical properties, the more water-\\nsoluble pollutants affect the mucous membranes of the eyes and upper airway and do not reach the lower airways and alveoli without the increased ventilation that results from exercise; less soluble gases, including nitrogen dioxide and ozone, can reach the lungs, where absorption from the airways is greatest.\\nInflammation is central to the response of the respira -\\ntory tract, and probably also the eye, to non-allergenic Fig. 5.15  Regional deposition predictions based on the \\nmodel proposed by the International Commission on \\nRadiological Protection Task Group on Lung Dynamics.

The level of house dust mite \\nexposure predicts the age of initial wheezing in children at risk of asthma ( Fig. 5.16 ). Of the many indoor air pol -\\nlutants other than indoor allergens, passive exposure to tobacco smoke is most firmly established as a cause of asthma in young children (Fig. 5.17). Mounting evidence shows that children of mothers who smoke are at increased risk, which may partially reflect the conse -\\nquences of in utero exposure to tobacco smoke compo -\\nnents from maternal smoking during pregnancy. The inflammation resulting from exposure to pollutants \\nmay be of consequence to the allergic disorders through several pathways. For example, the presence of non-specific inflammation may enhance responses to allergens such as the facilitation of allergen penetration as a result of increased permeability of the respiratory epithelium. In experimental exposures of volunteers with asthma, both ozone and nitrogen dioxide enhance the response to subsequent allergen challenge. There is also the possibil -\\nity of synergism between inflammation caused by air pollution and that provoked by allergens. With regard to asthma, heightened airway responsiveness secondary  \\nto pollutant exposure might augment the response to allergens and make clinically relevant effects more frequent.\\nAir pollution, allergic diseases, \\nand allergens\\nAllergic diseases\\nThe nose acts as a filter, removing larger particles and \\nsoluble gases from inhaled air, and inflammatory responses of the nose following inhalation of various pollutants have been well described. Ozone characteristically causes burning and irritation of the eyes and upper airway including the nose, and other pollutant gases have been shown to behave similarly. However, clinically relevant consequences of air pollution exposure for persons with allergic rhinitis have received little attention.\\nIn contrast, the role of air pollution in causing and \\nexacerbating asthma has been investigated extensively. Many of the relevant data come from epidemiological studies that have been directed at either assessing risk factors for disease or determining if the status of people with asthma varies in relation to air pollution exposure. Additional data come from controlled air pollution expo -\\nsures of volunteers with asthma in a variety of clinical studies where, of necessity, exposures are brief and limited to lower levels of pollutants, and the protocols generally exclude people with more severe disease.\\nThere is little indication that the general types of air \\npollution found in urban and industrialised areas con -\\ntribute to the production of asthma. Some reports describe a higher prevalence of non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness in more polluted areas, but defini-tive links to asthma have not been made. As indicated earlier, some outbreaks of asthma have been linked to specific agents, such as the problem of soybean-dust-induced asthma in Barcelona, but such episodes appear to be infrequent.\\nIndoor air pollutants have been identified as causes of \\nasthma, although it is still not known whether onset of asthma is a reflection of environmental and genetic inter -\\naction or if some patients develop asthma solely because Fig. 5.16  Relationship between the age at the onset of the \\nfirst wheezing episode in 21 atopic children and the highest \\nlevel of Der p 1 in house dust in 1979.

Data on these pollutants have been gained from \\nclinical studies, follow-up studies of people with asthma, and studies on rates of clinic and emergency room visits and hospitalization. Evidence from throughout the world indicates that these pollutants can exacerbate asthma. Particulate air pollution of diverse composition, including wood smoke particles and acidic particles, has been asso -\\nciated with measures of exacerbation (Fig. 5.19). Clinical studies show that some asthmatics have exquisite sensi -\\ntivity to sulphur dioxide, particularly when the dose delivered to the lungs is increased by exercise.

Indoor allergen exposure is, of course, tightly linked to the clinical status of asthmatics. For children, exposure to tobacco smoke increases the level of non-specific bronchial hyperrespon -\\nsiveness and exposed children tend to use medical resources more often than non-exposed children.

In this regard, earlier and extended pollen seasons have been positively correlated with climate warming in Europe, North America, and Asia for a number of allergen-producing species, for example Parietaria, olive, and cypress. Increased concen -\\ntrations of airborne pollen have also been shown to be a function of climate warming and modelling studies predict future increases. Increased airborne pollen con -\\ncentrations and warming temperatures have been linked with both the prevalence of pollinosis and increases in allergen amounts in pollen.\\nIn addition to a projected rise in global surface tem -\\nperature of 1.4  °C to 5.8  °C by 2100, climate change \\nscenarios predict atmospheric CO 2 levels will at least \\ndouble in the twenty-first century from the preindustrial level of 280 µmol mol\\n−1. However, there is a scarcity of \\ndata on the effect(s) of CO 2 enrichment alone, or in \\ncombination with temperature, on allergenic pollen-producing species and pollinosis. The few studies that do exist have focused on ragweed ( Ambrosia artemisiifolia) \\nwhere an increase in pollen number was found when it was grown at 600–700 µmol mol\\n−1 CO 2, compared with \\ngrowth at ambient levels of about 370 µmol mol−1. In \\naddition, increased atmospheric CO 2 concentrations led \\nto an increase in the content of Amb a 1, a major allergen, of ragweed pollen. A positive correlation between ragweed because many are pathogenesis-related proteins (see \\nT able 5.5). Although the presence of some allergens is constitutive, increases are likely because such proteins are produced in response to a variety of abiotic stressors, including pollutants. In this regard, allergen production per se, concentration and releasability may all be influ-enced by pollutants. For example, the concentration of some pollen allergens may be higher in urban environ-ments (e.g. Lol p 5, Cup a 3), others may be higher in rural environments (Phl p 5), and others may not be influenced (e.g. Bet v 1, 2 and 3) by environment. In addition, pollen extracts (e.g. birch) obtained from pollen derived from urban environments may demonstrate enhanced proinflammatory properties, indicating that pollutants act on proteins other than allergens. Other studies have shown that cadmium-polluted soils, whilst not necessarily influencing certain known pollen allergens (e.g. Poa a 1, 5), may cause the up-regulation of stress-related proteins with allergenic potential, given their sequence homology with allergens from other plant sources such as the pectin methyl esterase allergen Act d 7. With regard to releasability, both airborne and soil pol -\\nlutants have been shown to damage pollen grains and/or increase the rate of release of allergen-containing starch granules. In addition to these effects, exposure of pollen to pollutants has been shown to alter their allergenicity by a process of post-translational modification such as nitration due to exposure to NO\\n2, which may enhance or \\ndecrease allergenicity.\\nClimate change and allergic \\ndisease\\nIn early considerations of the impact of climate change \\non human health due to pollution, allergy-based diseases received far less attention than infectious diseases. However, with the mounting awareness within the scien -\\ntific and medical communities of the connections between epidemiological, aerobiological, and phenomenological data with respect to aeroallergen sources, in particular pollens, and climate change, there is growing recognition that allergic disease will have an increased impact on future public health. Currently, there is a scarcity of information regarding the impacts of increased CO\\n2 and/\\nor temperature on pollen allergen production, despite the fact that pollens contribute significantly to airborne aller -\\ngen loads and are the major cause of aeroallergen-related allergy in about 30% of the population in temperate regions. Because of the reproductive role of pollen, changes to number, structure, and/or biochemistry may have significant impacts on plant fitness, which then has implications for species occurrence, biodiversity, and  \\necosystem dynamics.

One hundred and fifty \\nyears ago asthma was considered rare and allergic rhinitis was almost unheard of. T oday in Europe, it is estimated that over 80 million persons have some manifestation of allergic disease. In the United States some 50 million persons, approximately 20% of the population, suffer from at least one form of allergy; it is the fifth leading chronic disease for all ages, and the third most common chronic disorder for children under 18 years of age. Allergic disease can take many different forms ( Box 6.1), but three of the most common \\nmanifestations of allergy include atopic dermatitis or eczema, allergic rhino -\\nconjunctivitis or hay fever, and allergic asthma. In Europe, approximately 10% of infants suffer from eczema, while amongst teenagers one in four experience allergic rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and 20% will develop asthma. In population studies, allergic diseases peak at different ages – food allergy and atopic dermatitis predominate in early childhood, whereas allergic rhinitis peaks in the second or third decade, and asthma shows a biphasic peak (Fig. 6.1 ).\\nAlthough the main consequence of allergic diseases is the suffering they \\ncause the patients who have these conditions, there are also substantial mon -\\netary costs. In Europe, direct medical costs for asthma are estimated to be \\n'17.7 billion per year, while the loss in productivity because of poor asthma \\ncontrol is approximately '9.8 billion annually. In the USA, the annual total \\ncost associated with rhinitis alone is approximately $11.5 billion – that is, $7.3 billion in direct costs including medication and doctor office visits and $4.28 billion for lost productivity. It is estimated that allergic rhinitis accounts for nearly 4 million missed or lost workdays each year in the USA. Some diseases, such as cancer and heart disease, have higher annual health utiliza -\\ntion costs while affecting persons near the end of life; allergic disease, however, often start early in life and continue throughout it, resulting in a greater cumulative health cost that is not apparent when viewing annual healthcare expenditures.\\nMuch of this suffering and many of these costs could be greatly reduced, \\nas effective treatments exist for the majority of allergic conditions. However, allergy often remains undiagnosed and inadequately treated, despite clear diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. Patients often wait too long to seek medical evaluation and instead take inappropriate over-the-counter remedies. Principles of allergy \\ndiagnosis\\nR Stokes Peebles, Martin K Church and  \\nStephen R Durham6\\nDEFINITION\\nSuccessful management of \\nallergic disease is dependent on the accurate diagnosis of the problem and its likely causes. This chapter describes allergy diagnosis from taking a history to specific allergy tests.\\n© 2012 Elsevier Ltd\\nDOI: 10.1016/B978-0-7234-3658-4.00005-6 129\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 139}),\n"," Document(page_content='Principles of allergy diagnosis6\\n130\\nhave ‘allergy facilitatory genes’. For example, in atopic \\ndermatitis the primary defect is poor epidermal integrity, which allows penetration of allergens through the skin and the subsequent development of allergy. In allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and allergic asthma, poor epithelial defence again allows entry to cause stimulation of IgE synthesis and, on re-exposure, clinical disease. In asthma, both allergic and non-allergic, there are also ‘lung genes’, which are described elsewhere.\\nAmong healthcare professionals, even in the same \\ncountry, the vocabulary of allergic diseases can be quite varied. As a result, the World Allergy Organization (WAO) has published a glossary of terminology to help healthcare professionals standardize communication with one another.\\n\\ue06a Atopy is defined as a personal and/or familial tendency, usually in childhood or adolescence, to become sensitized and produce IgE antibodies in response to ordinary exposure to allergens, usually proteins. Atopy, therefore, is a definition of an IgE antibody high-responder who may or may not have \\nclinical symptoms. Therefore, in practical terms ‘atopy’ may be defined as the presence of a positive skin test and/or elevated serum allergen-specific IgE to one or more common inhaled allergens.\\n\\ue06a Allergy is defined as ‘a hypersensitivity reaction initiated by immunologic mechanisms’ which can be either antibody or cell mediated. In other words, allergic individuals have symptoms of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, or eczema. The antibody isotype most commonly responsible for allergic reactions is IgE. However, it is important to recognize that not all hypersensitivity reactions that appear to be allergic in nature are necessarily caused by IgE. For example, systemic reactions to dextran, although they mimic anaphylaxis, result from IgG immune complexes. Other allergic reactions seem not to be mediated by antibodies at all. For instance, the pathogenesis of allergic contact dermatitis is attributed to activated antigen-specific  \\nlymphocytes.\\n\\ue06a Allergens are antigens that lead to one of the allergic phenotypes when a person sensitized to that antigen is subsequently exposed to that antigen. The majority of allergens are protein antigens, sometimes with carbohydrate side chains; however, there are instances in which carbohydrates themselves are likely to be allergens. One example may be delayed anaphylaxis to mammalian meats which appears to be related to IgE binding to the carbohydrate moiety galactose- α-1,3-galactose. Reactivity to this \\nallergen has implications for hypersensitivity to murine monoclonal antibody therapeutics containing this oligosaccharide. Low-molecular-weight chemicals including medications such as penicillin Also, many clinicians treat allergies as trivial and do not \\nexplore properly the medical basis of the disease and its effect on the quality of life of individuals. Because of this, appropriate management and therapy are often not put in place.\\nDefinitions and basic \\npathophysiology\\nAllergies are a family of diseases with complex and dif -\\nfering genetic underlying components that predispose \\nallergy-prone individuals to mount symptoms in response to specific environmental stimuli, such as high house dust mite and pollen loads and pollution. Although the genetic basis, development, and epidemiology of allergy are reviewed in depth in Chapters 2, 3, and 4 respectively, it is necessary to mention some aspects of these within the following definitions so that the reader can understand the concepts of allergy diagnosis. In simple terms, an allergic individual must have ‘allergy genes’ and ‘allergy facilitatory genes’. ‘Allergy genes’ predispose individuals to produce IgE in response to exposure to allergens. This does not mean that they will express clinically demon -\\nstrable allergies. Approximately 40% of the population has raised IgE levels, while in only 20% are there symp -\\ntoms of allergy. T o express disease, individuals must also Fig. 6.1  Manifestations of allergy differ with age.

If both parents have allergic disease, then the likelihood that a child has an allergic condition increases to roughly 80–85%.\\n\\ue06a Ask whether the symptoms are seasonal or \\nperennial. Symptoms of aeroallergen-induced rhinitis and asthma may be seasonal if caused by trees, grasses, weeds, or moulds. It is helpful for the evaluating physician to understand the general timing of the pollen seasons in the community in which the patient lives.

Not all allergic manifestations caused by aeroallergens are necessarily seasonal in nature; allergy symptoms may be year round or perennial if they are caused by that are not antigenic in isolation can act as haptens and bind to host ‘carrier’ proteins to become allergenic and stimulate IgE responses. Additionally, other low-molecular-weight chemicals, of which chromium, nickel, and formaldehyde are examples, can induce T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions.\\nAllergy history\\nBefore taking an allergy history, adopting a professional but friendly manner, the early establishment of eye contact, and the avoidance of extraneous distractions by interviewers should put patients at their ease. The history need not be time consuming, although patients should be allowed to give their own accounts of symptoms followed by structured prompts or questions to cover points listed below.

In these circumstances, symptoms may become \\ncontinuous and a causal relationship between allergen exposure and symptoms may not be evident to either the patient or the clinician.\\nOccupational allergy\\nAn occupational history should be obtained in all patients with asthma, rhinitis, and eczema. In contrast to occupa -\\ntional asthma (OA) (T able 6.2), occupational rhinitis is \\nless well documented although likely to be very common, \\nwith or without associated asthma. Knowledge of poten -\\ntial occupational causes is important. Symptoms tend to occur within the workplace or during the evening follow -\\ning work; they may improve at weekends and during holiday periods. OA, at least within the UK, is a regis -\\ntered and compensatable industrial disease – 5% of adult onset asthma may be attributed to an occupational cause. The associated loss of self-esteem, together with financial and social difficulties, may provoke symptoms of depres -\\nsive illness and even suicidal tendencies. Moreover, in up \\nto 50% of cases symptoms may persist for months or even \\nyears following termination of the occupational exposure. For these reasons an occupational cause should be estab -\\nlished early and certainly not missed. A history of all occupations since leaving school should be obtained if a critical timing of exposure to a potential occupational sensitizer and onset of symptoms is not to be missed. Allergic contact eczema (T able 6.3) may also result from common sensitizers in the home and workplace.related quality of life examine how patients perceive the impact of their illness on sleep, functioning at work or school, interpersonal relationships, and other features of daily life. For instance, children with asthma and allergy have greater rates of absence from school, whereas those with symptomatic allergic rhinitis have more difficulty in learning and may achieve lower grades in examinations. Therefore recognition of the severity of symptoms and intervention with appropriate disease-specific therapy will improve performance of both children at school and adults at work.\\nQuestionnaires that assess health-related quality of life \\ncan be segregated into those that are generic or disease specific. Generic questionnaires are pertinent for all persons and permit comparison of disease burden for a variety of medical conditions. Since generic question-naires can be used for any disease state, they may not have the specificity to discern between small changes in one parameter of quality of life for a certain disease that is meaningful to the individual patient. Disease-specific quality of life questionnaires are programmed to assess a particular patient demographic, an individual disease, or a particular symptom or function. These qualities of disease-specific questionnaires are designed to be more sensitive for changes in health status as they apply criteria that are relevant only to a particular condition.\\nThere are now many disease-specific questionnaires \\nthat measure health-related quality of life for allergic conditions, which are listed in Appendix 6.1. It is beyond \\nthe scope of this chapter to detail these questionnaires.\\nSpecial cases\\nAllergic versus non-allergic triggers\\nPatients with inhalant allergies from whatever cause develop hyperresponsiveness in the target organ. Certain features in the history may point to either allergic or non-allergic triggers as of an immediate response following either natural or experimental allergen exposure. Irritant-induced symptoms tend to be solely immediate, resolving \\nwithin minutes or hours, to provoke symptoms on first \\nexposure, to require high exposure concentrations, and to affect the majority of exposed subjects to a lesser or greater extent (Fig. 6.3). A good example is the patient with non-allergic, non-infective rhinitis who typically complains of symptoms on exposure to changes in tem -\\nperature, tobacco smoke, pollutants, perfumes, domestic sprays, bleach, and stressful circumstances. However, these distinctions should be regarded as only a guide since there is considerable overlap. There is no doubt that perennial allergens – resulting in repeated early and late symptoms – result in increased target organ hyperrespon -\\nsiveness with heightened sensitivity to non-specific Fig. 6.3  Inter relationships between allergy and \\nhyperresponsiveness, including features suggesting an \\nallergic or non-allergic trigger as the cause of symptoms.

Frequently, more than one organ system is \\ninvolved. For example, true food allergy is a rare cause of isolated asthma in adults, although severe food-induced allergy may provoke asthma associated with other typical organ involvement, e.g. lip tingling, angioedema, nettle rash, nausea, and vomiting.\\nAlthough obtaining a detailed history is absolutely nec -\\nessary in diagnosing food allergy, it is sometimes difficult because patients often have difficulty in dissociating symptoms provoked by food from other causes. In order to obtain information that will be useful for defining skin tests and oral food challenge tests, the following struc -\\ntured approach to questioning may be adopted:\\n1. What food do you believe caused the reaction?\\n2. How much of the food did you eat?\\n3. How long after eating the food did symptoms start to \\ndevelop?\\n4. Have you had the same symptoms when eating the \\nfood on previous occasions?\\n5. Are other factors, such as exercise, necessary to cause \\nthe symptoms?\\n6. How long is it since you had the last reaction to this \\nfood?\\nT o obtain a definitive diagnosis, the history should  \\nbe backed up by a skin test, patch testing, a diet  \\ndiary, elimination diets, and/or a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge. More information about these will be found in Chapter 14.\\nClass 2 allergens comprise mainly pollen-derived  \\nallergens with cross-reactivity to foods ( T able 6.4) and \\nare often associated with oral allergy syndrome, some -\\ntimes called pollen-food allergy syndrome. Most com -\\nmonly, sensitization is through the respiratory tract following pollen inhalation. The primary allergens are highly conserved proteins or carbohydrates present within the pollen and fruits of a wide variety of plants. They include pathogenesis-related proteins (PRP), profilins, Fig 6.4  Common allergenic foods. \\nTable 6.2  Common examples of causes of \\noccupational asthma\\nAgent At-risk employment\\nLaboratory animals Scientific, animal-house \\nwork, etc.\\nFlour Baking\\nBiological enzymes Soap powder industry work\\nWood dusts Saw milling, furniture manufacture\\nLatex rubber gloves Health workers\\nBleaching agents, hair dyesHairdressing\\nIsocyanates Paint spraying, printing industry\\nColophony (solder \\nfumes)Electronics industry\\nTable 6.3  Ex amples of allergic contact eczema\\nAgent Source\\nNickel Coins, watches, jewellery\\nCobalt Metal-plated objects, wet cement\\nFragrances Cosmetics\\nLanolin Cosmetics, moisturizing creams\\np-Phenylenediamine Hair dye, fur dye\\nEpoxy resins Adhesives\\nFood allergy and intolerance\\nUp to 20% of the population perceive food as a cause of \\ntheir allergy-like symptoms, whereas the prevalence of true food allergy is around 3–4% in adults and up to 6% in children.

For these allergens, there is a clear association between ingestion (or contact) with the food and the onset of symptoms.

IgE levels are low in the fetus and newborn because these molecules do not readily cross the placenta. In general, serum IgE increases with age until the first half of the second decade of life, whereupon they begin to decrease proportionately with age. Therefore, it is important to examine total IgE levels in the framework of age-adjusted reference values for non-allergic persons. Allowing for these caveats, measuring total IgE can be useful as shown by the fact that total serum IgE >\\n100 IU/mL before age \\n6 is a well-recognized risk factor for allergic rhinitis. However, it must also be emphasized that the presence or absence of IgE antibodies alone is not conclusive of disease. For example, smokers often have high IgE levels in the absence of demonstrable allergic disease. There -\\nfore, IgE levels may be used only as supportive informa -\\ntion in the diagnosis of allergy and not in isolation.\\nT esting for allergen-specific IgE may be done in two \\nways: in vivo tests such as skin testing and in vitro meas -\\nurement in blood samples. In general, skin testing tends to be more sensitive whereas allergen-specific IgE meas -\\nurements in vitro may be more specific. Skin testing is usually performed first for evaluation of sensitization to aeroallergens. However, there are other instances, such as in evaluation of sensitivity to hymenoptera, where determination of allergen-specific IgE can be an impor -\\ntant adjunct to skin testing, especially when skin-testing results are negative. Both skin testing and in vitro deter -\\nmination of allergen-specific IgE are generally used before direct allergen provocation as this testing has the risk of inciting significant allergic reactions.\\nSkin testing\\nSkin testing can take one of two forms: epicutaneous (more usually known as skin prick testing, or SPT) or intradermal testing. A summary of the uses of skin prick testing is shown in Box 6.5.\\nSkin prick testing usually has sufficient sensitivity and \\nspecificity to be the sole method of skin testing necessary \\nfor most clinical scenarios. In allergic rhinitis, the sensitiv -\\nity of SPT is 85–87% and its specificity 79–86%, while \\nin allergic asthma the sensitivity of SPT has been reported to be as high as 91–98%. There are some situations, however, such as testing for penicillin allergy or venom hypersensitivity, in which intradermal testing is war -\\nranted because of its increased sensitivity. However, for safety reasons, SPT should be the only skin testing pro -\\ncedure performed in the diagnosis of food allergy.\\nSkin prick tests are usually performed either on the \\nvolar aspect of the patient’s forearm or on the back. Whereas the back is considered to be more reactive, the forearm is more convenient. A drop of an allergen extract Clinical and laboratory evaluation \\nof allergy\\nT reatment for allergic diseases is often initiated based on \\nthe patient’s history alone. Symptoms of type I hyper -\\nsensitivity that begin after a clearly defined environmen-tal exposure should prompt institution of environmental controls to eliminate future exposure to the suspected allergen. Pharmacotherapy may also be started if environ -\\nmental controls are not able to eliminate the allergen to levels that do not precipitate symptoms (for instance, in the case of ubiquitous pollens). However, many patients will continue to have symptoms despite these initial ther -\\napeutic manoeuvres. In such cases, the allergen may not have been correctly identified by history, prompting a more comprehensive search to identify the relevant aller -\\ngen to institute more aggressive and definitive (as well as expensive!) environmental controls. In other instances, pharmacotherapy may either not be providing sufficient relief from the symptoms, or side effects or toxicity may be limiting the use of these agents. In these cases, testing to confirm that allergic disease is indeed causing the patient’s symptoms is important to reassure the patient and physician that the therapeutic plan is indeed on target to mitigate the patient’s suffering, and whether pharmacotherapy should be continued or increased. In cases where the maximal pharmacological therapy that the patient desires or can tolerate has been reached, then allergen testing is critical to decide whether specific immunotherapy or anti-IgE therapy should be consid -\\nered. This section reviews the in vivo and in vitro tests that have evidence-based utility in allergic disease  \\ndiagnosis, as well as tests that are used by some  \\npractitioners in diagnosing allergy, but have unproven effectiveness.\\nLung function tests\\nPeak flow monitoring and spirometry, together with an assessment of reversibility (either before or after a bron-chodilator), or repeated peak flow measurements at home in order to detect diurnal variation, will confirm or exclude the reversibility of airflow obstruction (i.e. asthma) in the majority of cases. Measurements of airway hyperresponsiveness by means of histamine or metha-choline inhalation testing may be helpful, particularly in mild cases where lung function may be normal and response to a bronchodilator is absent.

For instance, these differences include variations in the different solid phases to which allergen is bound, as well as in the composition, concentration, and potency of the specific allergen linked to the solid phase. Variations in the allergen used result in different populations of a patient’s IgE that are detected in the assay.\\nMore recently the advent of chip technology has \\nimproved allergen-specific IgE detection, as a single chip \\nis able to identify multiple allergens in as little as 20  µL \\nof serum. This system has the major benefit of allowing the recognition of cross-reactivity of a patient’s IgE against structurally similar antigens from different sources. This test is currently available in Europe and will soon be available in the USA.\\nMany clinical studies have been performed to evaluate \\nthe reliability of in vitro testing for food-specific IgE to clinical food allergy. Using the ImmunoCAP system, \\nthreshold levels of allergen-specific IgE to egg (6  kUa/L), \\npeanut (15  kUa/L), fish (20  kUa/L), and milk (32  kUa/L) \\nhave been shown to portend positive food challenge results with greater than 95% accuracy. Therefore, evalu -\\nation of allergen-specific IgE could possibly obviate the need for potentially life-threatening reactions to foods during challenge tests. Just as in skin testing, where  \\nthe size of the test corresponds to the likelihood that a patient has allergy to that allergen but does not reflect the severity of the clinical reaction, it is important to  \\nnote that the levels of allergen-specific IgE have also not been shown to correlate with the severity of a clinical allergen reaction for either food or insect venoms. A comparison of skin prick testing and in vitro tests is shown in Box 6.7.\\nBasophil histamine release test\\nAllergy screening may also be performed by assessing histamine released from blood basophils after the There are specific circumstances regarding skin test \\nthat deserve special notice, particularly anaphylaxis and food allergy. Following anaphylaxis, skin testing should  \\nbe delayed for at least 4 weeks as testing following may give a false negative result to the allergen that actually caused the anaphylactic episode. This situation often arises in situations where anaphylaxis has occurred to foods, insect venom, or medications. Investigation of pos -\\nsible allergic reactions to food also warrants special mention as extensive research has been performed in this field that has been further evaluated by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges. Such studies reveal that a negative skin prick test has a negative predicative accuracy of greater than 90%, essentially ruling out an IgE-mediated reaction to the food being tested. Using fresh fruit and vegetables in skin testing increases the diagnosis yield as commercially prepared extracts may not be as stable as the fresh food. In the situation where a patient has symptoms of allergy to a certain food, the size of a positive skin test to a food does correspond with the likelihood of allergy to that food, but the size does not correspond to the severity of the clinical reaction when the food is ingested. Intradermal skin testing should not be performed with foods because of poor specificity with positive results from this form of testing. Finally, skin testing should not be performed in the absence of a clinical history suggesting food allergy because a positive skin test may reveal the presence of allergen-specific IgE, but may not mean the patient is allergic to the food giving the positive skin test. Similarly, testing to venom in the absence of a positive history is not recommended because it is estimated that one-quarter of people without history of systemic reaction may have positive skin tests to these allergen extracts.\\nIn vitro laboratory tests\\nIn vitro measurement of allergen-specific IgE is the labo -\\nratory equivalent of clinical skin testing. Formerly, meas -\\nurement of allergen-specific IgE was performed using the radioallergosorbent test (RAST); however, new tools have been developed that supersede this method. Although there is some variation among different proprietary methods for measurement of allergen-specific IgE, the basic concept is that an allergen is linked to a solid phase to which a patient’s serum is added. With incubation, the patient’s allergen-specific IgE binds to the allergen-linked solid phase (Fig. 6.9). After washing of unbound patient antibody from the allergen-linked solid phase, a labelled human anti-IgE antibody is added; this will then bind to the patient’s IgE that is bound to the allergen-linked  \\nsolid phase. Detection of this human anti-IgE antibody bound to the patient’s allergen-specific IgE provides the readout for this assay. It is important to note that, although this general scheme is used to detect allergen-specific IgE, there are substantial differences among the Fig. 6.9  Principles of immunoassay for measuring allergen-\\nspecific IgE in serum.

Evidence for these antibodies comes from in vivo studies of autoreactivity with the autologous serum skin test (ASST) in which autologous intradermal injection of serum causes a wheal and flare response. In vitro detection of these antibodies \\nis performed by incubation of 40  µl of patient’s serum \\nwith white blood cells, containing 1–2% basophils, from a healthy non-atopic donor for 1 hour in the presence of IL-3.\\nMeasurement of environmental \\nallergens\\nA number of naturally occurring protein antigens in the \\npatient’s environment may give rise to sensitization and stimulation of IgE production. Many of these allergens are well known or visible; others are hidden and have to be determined by a thorough medical history and analysis of the environment. Different biological and immuno-chemical methods are presently available for the demon-stration of allergens in air and in dust sampling ( T able \\n6.7). Determining the relationship between symptoms and allergens and the decrease in symptoms during aller -\\ngen reduction makes up a part of the testing for allergy.\\nA simple technique for sampling dust is to use a vacuum \\ncleaner with a special filter that retains small particles \\nfound in the dust. The dust is extracted 1  :  3 (w/v) in \\nsaline for an hour; the presence of a detergent in the buffer may be required for optimal extraction and the allergen content is identified and quantified by immuno -\\nchemical techniques. For some purified allergens, mono -\\nclonal antibodies have been produced, thereby enabling quantification (in nanograms of major allergen per gram addition of allergen extract. In this test, blood samples, which may be as small as 20 µL for each allergen, are \\npipetted into the wells of an ELISA plate precoated with the suspected allergens. The plate is then incubated at 37°C for up to 1 hour and the resultant histamine release estimated. Basophil histamine release, which is usually performed by specialist laboratories, takes only a few hours to perform. This test, which has a sensitivity and specificity similar to that of RAST , is semiquantified on the basis of the concentration of the allergen extract that gives rise to a certain amount of histamine released. As the basophils of about 5% of the population do not release histamine in vitro, a positive response to anti-IgE, used as a positive control, is absolutely necessary to validate a negative result. Furthermore, as the majority of the popu -\\nlation has some circulating IgE, a positive result to anti-IgE is not indicative of the presence of allergy in the absence of a corroborative history.\\nA second use of the basophil degranulation test is in \\nthe investigation of chronic spontaneous urticaria.

Addition -\\nally, there will be instances when the clinical history of manifestations of allergic disease does not match skin testing or in vitro assays assessing antigen-specific IgE. In these situations, in vivo provocation testing can be con -\\nsidered to assess further the relationship between symp -\\ntoms and physiological end points. Such tests may use pharmacological agents and therefore not be allergen  \\nspecific, for instance inhaled methacholine or histamine challenges used in asthma assessment, or the presumed allergen may be used in certain in vivo diagnostic assess -\\nment such as double-blind, placebo-controlled food  \\nchallenges (DBPCFC) utilized to evaluate symptoms pre -\\nsumed to be caused by ingestion of foods or other sub -\\nstances via the gastrointestinal tract.\\nOrgan challenge tests can be performed to assess \\nwhether or not a specific allergen is definitively causing a specific constellation of symptoms suggestive of an aller -\\ngic reaction. The site of organ challenge is based on the patient’s history and may include the conjunctiva, upper or lower respiratory tract, or skin for allergic contact dermatitis or insect sting. These tests are usually reserved for the situation where skin test or in vitro allergen IgE results do not correspond to patient history or clinical situation. Most often, these tests are performed in a controlled research setting because of the possible risk of severe, life-threatening reactions to direct organ allergen challenge. Details of specific in vivo provocation tests will be found in later chapters on individual diseases.\\nUnproven tests\\nThere are many unproven ‘diagnostic’ tests performed by ‘food ecologists’ and alternative practitioners. These tests are of unproven diagnostic validity, are often time con-suming and expensive, and are therefore not to be recom -\\nmended (Box 6.8 ).\\nGolden rules of allergy diagnosis  \\n(Box 6.9 )\\nIn this chapter, the importance, first, of taking a careful history in accurate allergy diagnosis has been emphasized. Furthermore, the importance of using specific IgE/skin tests as confirmation, and interpreting them only in of dust). Other devices for collecting airborne allergens are available (e.g. stationary high volume air samplers and portable air samplers). Mould spores can be identified and quantified in the home, the working place of the patient, or the outdoor air.\\nMast cell tryptase\\nThe measurement of serum tryptase is used to diagnosis conditions where mast cell activation occurs either acutely, such as in anaphylaxis, or in situations of ongoing mast cell activation, such as in systemic mastocytosis. Mast cells contain approximately 300–700 times more tryptase than do basophils, and consequently serum tryp -\\ntase is more reflective of a mast cell source. There are two forms of mast-cell-derived tryptase: α-tryptase and \\nβ-tryptase. The concentration of serum α-tryptase is con -\\nsidered to be reflective of the number of mast cells, while serum β-tryptase is a marker of mast cell activation. \\nLevels of α-tryptase are obtained by subtracting the con-\\ncentration of β-tryptase from the total tryptase concen-\\ntration. In healthy subjects, total serum tryptase levels \\nrange between 1 and 10  ng/mL while serum β-tryptase \\nlevels are less than 1  ng/mL. In contrast, if baseline serum \\ntotal tryptase levels are greater than 20  ng/mL and serum \\nβ-tryptase levels are greater than 1  ng/mL, systemic mas -\\ntocytosis should be strongly considered. If an anaphylac-tic event is suspected, blood for total and β-tryptase \\nshould be obtained from 30 minutes to 4 hours after the episode occurs. Although because of ethnic differences there is no absolute cut-off level for diagnosing anaphy -\\nlaxis, levels above 12–14  ng/mL are generally accepted as \\nindicative of anaphylaxis.\\nInterpretation of specific  \\nIgE/skin tests\\nThe sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic cut-points  \\nfor clinical relevance for either skin testing and/or  \\nserum allergen-specific IgE will depend on a number of factors. These include the quality of extracts used and the experience of the operator (or laboratory). Geo -\\ngraphic location and variation of the prevalence of envi -\\nronmental allergens will have an enormous impact. Similarly, the predictive value of tests will be influenced by the prevalence of the suspected allergy in the popula -\\ntion studied. For example the prevalence of ‘true’ allergy in relation to positive IgE tests is likely to be higher in referrals to a specialist allergy clinic compared with those screened in primary care.\\nWhereas it is true that the negative predictive value of \\nskin tests and specific IgE is far more robust, the phe-nomenon of local IgE synthesis and expression has been increasingly recognized. Again this illustrates the impor -\\ntance of re-evaluation of the history in the interpretation ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 152}),\n"," Document(page_content='Conclusion – diagnostic approach\\n 6\\n143panels’. This is particularly relevant in adult allergy prac -\\ntice where the perception of food allergy in the general \\npopulation is high and ‘food allergy panels’ are increas -\\ningly available on the high street or the internet. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions, such as exercise-induced anaphylaxis where ‘latent ‘ allergy to foods such as wheat, peanut, or fish may represent cofactors that manifest only after exercise. In paediatric practice there is also a legitimate lower threshold for multiple IgE testing in the presence of potentially allergic clinical man -\\nifestations where the history may be less discriminating – although in the authors’ view, to avoid confusion and anxiety, ‘paediatric panels’ should be initiated only by practitioners with considerable experience and skill in the diagnosis and management of paediatric allergy.\\nConclusion – diagnostic approach\\nAllergy diagnosis depends primarily on the clinical history. This history, aided by a physical examination and objec -\\ntive tests of IgE sensitivity (either skin tests or serum  \\nIgE measurements), is used to focus on the following questions:\\n\\ue06a Is the patient atopic?\\n\\ue06a Does allergy contribute to the patient’s symptoms?\\n\\ue06a What are the clinically relevant allergens?\\nA simple diagnostic approach, including points when \\npatients should be referred to an allergy specialist is pre -\\nsented in Figure 6.10. There should be a high index of \\nsuspicion for allergy in patients presenting with symp -\\ntoms of asthma, rhinitis, or eczema, particularly if there is an associated personal or family history of other atopic disease. Whether or not allergy is suspected on the basis of the initial history, a limited number of skin prick tests or in vitro tests for specific IgE, to a limited number of common aeroallergens should be performed in the major -\\nity of patients to confirm or exclude atopy; a physical examination should also be included. Only when both the clinical history and other investigations are negative can allergy be excluded with a high degree of confidence. Conversely, only when the history and tests are both positive should allergy management or pharmacotherapy be instituted. Where there is discordance, above all, the history should be reassessed. Specialist referral and, occa -\\nsionally, more sophisticated tests or specific provocation testing may be required. However, it should be empha-sized that results of clinical investigations, even when combined with a careful history, will not confirm or exclude absolutely relevant allergy in every individual case.the context of the clinical history has been repeatedly highlighted.\\nA fourth ‘golden rule’ in allergy diagnosis is that if you \\ndo not want to know the result of a test then don’t do the test! Allergists are frequently confronted by patients referred to them who have a ‘panel’ of allergy tests in their possession with multiple positives that do not coin -\\ncide with symptoms on exposure. This is particularly problematic for indiscriminate food allergy panels where patients are concerned whether or not they should avoid foods to which they may have positive IgE/skin tests, but which they tolerate perfectly well. This requires much consultation time to unravel, and may require perform -\\nance of otherwise unnecessary provocation tests in order to exclude allergy and/or to reassure an understandably anxious patient. There are also medicolegal implications as to whether verbal reassurance in the absence of provo -\\ncation testing is sufficient in such a setting.\\nIt follows naturally from the foregoing that there is \\nalmost no place for indiscriminate ‘allergy-screening Box 6.8  T ests for which there is no diagnostic validity in \\nallergic disorders\\n\\ue06a Cytotoxic tests\\n\\ue06a Pro vocation–neutralization tests\\n\\ue06a V ega testing (a ‘black box’ electrical test); test is \\nbased on the addition of food extracts to a chamber \\ncontained within an electrical circuit completed by the patient\\n\\ue06a Applied kinesiology\\n\\ue06a Iridolog y\\n\\ue06a Chemical analysis of body fluids, hair, or other tissue\\n\\ue06a F ood-specific IgG, IgG4, and IgG/IgG4 antibody tests\\n\\ue06a Auricular cardiac reflex testing (based on pulse rate)\\n1.

The principles, however, are the same. In its early stages, allergy may present as isolated episodes of asthma, rhinitis, or urticaria. However, as the condition progresses, an under -\\nlying pathology of allergic inflammation develops leading to chronic disease in which the episodic exacerbations, or attacks, can become more severe. The drugs used to treat allergy may, therefore, be classified into two groups: those aimed primarily at the relief of the symptoms of the acute exacerba-tions and those primarily for treatment of the underlying inflammation. These categories are not completely watertight as some drugs aimed princi -\\npally at providing relief from immediate symptoms may also influence the underlying inflammation. It should be stressed, however, that the treatment strategies outlined in this chapter are primarily aimed at relieving symptoms and controlling the progression of the allergic condition rather than curing it as, to date, this has not been possible.\\nAdrenaline (US epinephrine) and \\nadrenoceptor stimulants\\nThe use of adrenaline in the relief of asthma symptoms and as a life-saving \\ndrug in systemic anaphylaxis has been established for almost 100 years. Chemical modification of adrenaline to improve receptor selectivity has yielded α- and β-adrenoceptor stimulants for the treatment of nasal conges -\\ntion and asthma respectively.\\nAdrenaline\\nFor the treatment of systemic anaphylaxis, the ability of adrenaline to stimu -\\nlate both α- and β-receptors, as illustrated in Figure 7.1, contributes to its \\nbeneficial effects.

It is therefore essential that prompt follow-up care is given.\\nβ2-Adrenoceptor stimulants\\nFor the treatment of bronchial asthma, many of the effects of adrenaline are undesirable; the cardiovascular effects, particularly stimulation of cardiac arrhythmias, are of particular concern. Many of those problems have now been overcome by chemical modifications of the adrenaline molecule and by developing preparations with a satisfactory pharmacokinetic profile when administered to the lung by inhalation.\\nThe chemical modification of adrenaline in 1941 was \\nto replace the terminal methyl group on the side chain by an isopropyl group ( Fig. 7.2). This increase in the bulk \\nof the side-chain produced isoprenaline (US isoprotere -\\nnol), a drug that acts almost exclusively at β-receptors. \\nFurther increases in the bulk of this substituent produced drugs that, although having decreased absolute potency, have an increased degree of selectivity for β\\n2-receptors \\nover β1-receptors. Further chemical modifications to \\nreduce metabolism have lengthened their duration of action up to ≈4 hours for salbutamol (US albuterol) and \\nterbutaline, in excess of 12 hours for salmeterol and formoterol, and up to 24 hours in newer formulations skin and viscera. Adrenaline is rapidly inactivated by  \\ntwo enzymatic processes: by monoamine oxidase (MAO) in neuronal tissue and by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in extraneuronal tissues. This means that is has a short duration of action and may have to be given repeatedly as described below.\\nUses and administration\\nAnaphylaxis\\nAdrenaline is the drug of choice for the management of anaphylaxis. The sooner adrenaline is administered after the diagnosis of anaphylaxis the better is the prognosis. Underprescribing or delayed prescribing results in a poorer prognosis and an increased frequency of emer -\\ngency admissions and death. Physicians treating patients with anaphylaxis should administer adrenaline into the muscle of the lateral thigh (vastus lateralis) since this results in faster rises in blood levels and higher concentra -\\ntions compared with administration subcutaneously or into the muscle of the arm.\\nThe dose of adrenaline in adults is 0.3–0.5  mL of a 1 \\nin 1000 solution (0.3–0.5  mg). In children, the dose of \\nadrenaline is 0.01  mg per kilogram of body weight. The \\nadministration of adrenaline can be repeated every 5–15 minutes as needed. In adult patients who do not respond to intramuscular adrenaline and have shock with cardio -\\nvascular collapse, intravenous adrenaline can be adminis-\\ntered at a starting rate of 1–4  µg per minute. In children, \\nthis dose is typically 0.1  µg per kilogram of body weight. \\nIt is imperative that intravenous injection of adrenaline be given slowly so as to avoid the possibility of causing a cardiac arrhythmia.\\nSelf-administration of adrenaline by patients can be \\nlifesaving. Patients at risk should carry a preloaded syringe of adrenaline (EpiPen, T winject, or the equivalent) with them at all times and be taught the appropriate use with administration into the lateral thigh. Even if patients feel better after administration of adrenaline, they should see a physician immediately or go to the nearest emergency Fig. 7.1  Actions of adrenaline (epinephrine).

As this is a direct action, β2-\\nagonists are able to relax bronchial smooth muscle regard -\\nless of the contractile stimulus, thus giving rise to the term ‘functional antagonists’. Similarly, β\\n2-adrenoceptor \\nstimulants prevent the activation of mast cells, but not basophils, to release their mediators. In this respect,  \\nβ\\n2-stimulants are considerably more effective than the \\narchetypal mast cell stabilizer, cromolyn sodium. As the highest concentration of β\\n2-receptors in the lung is found \\non the luminal aspect of bronchial epithelial cells, it is postulated that β\\n2-agonists stimulate these cells to release \\ntheir bronchorelaxant factors. β2-Receptors are also \\npresent on ganglia of vagal efferent nerves and inhibit  \\nthe release of acetylcholine.

Thus, \\nwith high systemic concentrations, β1-receptor-mediated \\neffects on the heart may become apparent.\\nMechanism of action\\nMore is probably known about the biochemical mecha -\\nnism of action of β2-adrenoceptor stimulants than any of \\nthe other drugs used in the treatment of allergic diseases. The actions of β\\n2-adrenoceptor stimulants are summa -\\nrized in Figure 7.3. Briefly, interaction of a β2-stimulant \\nwith its receptor unit initiates the binding of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to the α-subunit of the regulatory G \\nprotein leading to its dissociation from the G-protein complex. This subunit then complexes with adenylate cyclase (AC), the catalytic unit of the complex, activating it to generate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). cAMP then acts as a second or intracellular messenger to activate a series of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (cAMP-dPK), which phosphorylate a number of proteins crucial to many intra -\\ncellular biochemical events.\\nFig. 7.3  Activation of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinases. The diagram shows two β-adrenoceptor molecules, each of which \\nis composed of three transmembrane loops. Stimulation of the receptor (left) causes its activation, in which the αs unit of the \\nheterotrimeric Gs protein binds GTP and dissociates from the complex to the adenylyl cyclase catalytic unit (AC). Activated AC \\ncatalyses the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which binds to the regulatory units (R) of cAMP-\\ndependent protein kinases (cAMP-dPK) thus freeing the catalytic units (C) to phosphorylate-specific proteins.

They can, however, be used for prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm. LABA are most appropriately used in a combination inhaler with corticosteroids for the management of chronic persistent asthma in patients not adequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroids alone.\\nRecently, the United States Food and Drug Administra -\\ntion (FDA) raised concerns about the potential adverse consequences of LABA, including death. The FDA made two controversial recommendations: to stop the use of LABA if possible once asthma control is achieved, step-ping the dose down, and to use LABA only in patients whose asthma is not well controlled with low or medium doses of inhaled corticosteroid, stepping it up. However, there is a large body of evidence suggesting that the addi -\\ntion of a LABA to inhaled corticosteroids improves asthma control and quality of life. Asthma deaths have declined since LABA have become available. At present, we recommend following evidence-based guidelines for the appropriate use of LABA unless new data confirm a potential increased risk to benefit ratio than currently reported.\\nα-Adrenoceptor stimulants\\nThe nasal mucosa is highly vascular, containing an exten -\\nsive capillary network and large cavernous vascular sinu -\\nsoids. The tone of these vessels is largely maintained  \\nby sympathetic nervous system fibres, which release noradrenaline (US norepinephrine) and neuropeptide  \\nY to cause vasoconstriction. Nasal decongestants, such  \\nas ephedrine, oxymetazoline, and xylometazoline, are α-adrenoceptor stimulants that mimic the vasoconstric -\\ntor effects of noradrenaline to reduce nasal blockage by decreasing nasal blood flow and reducing mucosal oedema.\\nA major problem with the use of topical nasal decon-\\ngestants, particularly with the more potent agents such as oxymetazoline and xylometazoline, is that they cause a reduction in the number of α-adrenoceptors – which \\noccurs over just a few days. Thus when intranasal decon -\\ngestants are used for more than 3–5 days they may lead to rebound swelling of the nasal mucosa. This may tempt the further use of the decongestant, leading to a vicious cycle of events with possible long-term consequences.\\nUses and administration\\nAllergic rhinitis\\nThere are very few data supporting the clinical efficacy of oral decongestants for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and nasal congestion. Due to side effects, including insomnia, irritability, anxiety, tremors, palpitations, inhaled β\\n2-agonist formulations limiting their utility. \\nAlthough oral β2-agonists may have a role in some chil -\\ndren, metered dose inhalers with appropriate spacer devices are preferred. Similarly, the inhaled route is also preferred over parenteral administration since the onset of action is quicker and the degree of bronchodilatation equivalent or greater with fewer side effects. Proper metered-dose inhaler technique results in rapid and high dose delivery of β\\n2-agonists. Used with a holding chamber, \\nmetered dose inhalers require less patient coordination and reduce oropharyngeal deposition. In the emergency management of asthma exacerbations, metered dose inhalers with or without a spacer device can be adminis -\\ntered every 20–30 minutes. Nebulizer therapy may be preferred for patients who are uncooperative or severely obstructed and unable to appropriately use a metered dose inhaler. However, the routine use of nebulizers for delivery of short acting β\\n2-agonists is generally unneces-\\nsary. Dry-powder inhalers are breath actuated and also require less patient coordination. Because they typically require a rapid deep inhalation, their use is best reserved for children at least 4 years of age and adults, and not during an exacerbation.\\nShort-acting β\\n2-agonists have an onset of action within \\n5 minutes and a typical duration of action of 4–6 hours (T able 7.1). These agents are now designated ‘quick relief medications’ and they are the drug of choice for treating acute asthma symptoms and exacerbations as well as for preventing exercise-induced bronchospasm. The use of short acting β\\n2-agonists more than twice per week indi-\\ncates inadequate asthma control and the need for initia -\\ntion or intensification of anti-inflammatory controller medications. Regularly scheduled daily chronic use of short acting β\\n2-agonists is not recommended.\\nThere are currently two available long-acting β2-agonists \\n(LABA): salmeterol and formoterol, which have onsets of action in approximately 30 minutes and less than 5 minutes respectively. Both agents have duration of action of greater than 12 hours (see T able 7.1). Because formot-\\nerol has an onset of action similar to short-acting β\\n2-\\nagonists, it has been used as a rescue medication with and without inhaled corticosteroids. There are several longer-acting formulations with onset of action in less than 5 \\nTable 7.1  Durat ion of action of β 2-stimulants\\nβ2-stimulant Onset of action Duration of action\\nSalbutamol \\n(albuterol)<5 min 4–6 h\\nTerbutaline <5 min 4–6 h\\nFormoterol <5 min >12 h\\nSalmeterol ∼30 min >12 h', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 160}),\n"," Document(page_content='Methylxanthines\\n 7\\n151Consequently, a variety of alternative mechanisms have \\nbeen proposed, which are summarized in Figure 7.4. \\nHowever, the PDE inhibition theory has recently gained more credence from two lines of evidence. First is the observation that, at therapeutic doses, there is evidence in leukocytes in vivo of increased levels of cAMP , which suggests that even a small and subtle action on PDE at these concentrations may be sufficient to confer clinical activity. Second is the identification of seven families of PDE isoenzymes, many of which contain multiple sub -\\ntypes that are encoded by distinct genes, and the synthe-sis of specific inhibitors for them. Of particular note is the finding that bronchial smooth muscle and inflamma -\\ntory cells, including mast cells, have type 4 PDE (PDE4). Initial studies with inhibitors of this isoenzyme indicate that they carry the beneficial actions of theophylline while being devoid of some of the side effects. Drugs of this class are undergoing intense clinical trial at present and are described later.\\nThe major disadvantage with theophylline is its narrow \\ntherapeutic window ( Fig. 7.5). The beneficial effects of \\nthe drug in long-term management are usually observed \\nonly with plasma levels in the range of 5–15  mg/mL. \\nBelow 5  mg/mL, the drug is comparatively ineffective \\nand, above 20  mg/mL, toxic effects are observed that \\nincrease in number and in severity with increasing plasma concentrations. Because of this relationship, the prudent physician will regularly monitor serum theophylline levels and adjust the dose so that possible life-threatening toxic-ity is avoided.\\nUses and administration\\nAsthma\\nMethylxanthines can be administered intravenously, orally, or rectally. Intravenous aminophylline is rarely used since there is no significant benefit over inhaled β\\n2-\\nagonists for the management of acute severe asthma. The tachycardia, and dizziness, they are not recommended for use as monotherapy. However, some patients may benefit from their use on an as-needed basis for the acute man -\\nagement of nasal congestion. Oral decongestants should not be used by the elderly, during pregnancy and by patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders includ-ing hypertension. Furthermore, sympathomimetics may cause a hypertensive crisis if used during treatment with MAO inhibitor drugs.\\nIntranasal decongestants are much more effective in \\nrelieving nasal obstruction. They have a rapid onset of action and can improve nasal obstruction when used for 3–5 days. However, they do not improve other symptoms of rhinitis. Intranasal decongestants may have the same systemic side effects as oral decongestants, but typically the scope and severity are less. However, the use of intranasal decongestants should be limited to no more than 3–5 days because of the concern that prolonged use may lead to rebound swelling of the nasal mucosa and to drug-induced rhinitis (rhinitis medicamentosa).\\nThere is a net clinical benefit from regular use of a \\ncombination of oral H\\n1-antihistamine and oral decongest -\\nant compared with oral H 1-antihistamine alone in allergic \\nrhinitis. However, the small improvement in nasal symp -\\ntoms seems to be counterbalanced by the increased risk of adverse effects. Although there are no published reports supporting the use of a combination of oral  \\nH\\n1-antihistamine and oral decongestant as a rescue or \\nas-needed medication, it may be of benefit for some patients.\\nMethylxanthines\\nMethylxanthines, in the form of coffee and extracts from the tea plant, have been used for the treatment of bron -\\nchial asthma for almost 700 years. T oday the predomi -\\nnant methylxanthine in clinical use is theophylline, given either as the native drug, as its water-soluble ethylene diamine salt, aminophylline, or as a long-acting conjugate, such as choline theophyllinate. The use of these drugs has markedly diminished with the availability of long acting β\\n2-agonists.\\nTheophylline\\nMechanism of action\\nThe precise mechanism by which theophylline acts as an antiasthma drug is still somewhat obscure. Clearly it has the potential to inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), thus causing the elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP by preventing its breakdown (see Fig. 7.3). The theory \\nfor this mechanism of action in asthma has been based on biochemical and in vitro studies that use theophylline at concentrations which would be toxic in vivo.

Several phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors have been tested in COPD and asthma.

T oday, chemically modified derivatives of atropine are used as bronchodilator drugs.\\nMechanism of action\\nStimulation by acetylcholine of muscarinic M 3-receptors \\non bronchial smooth muscle initiates its contraction  \\nby a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-mediated pathway. Atropine and related drugs are competitive and reversible antagonists of this effect of acetylcholine, thereby producing a dose-related inhibition of smooth muscle contraction (Fig. 7.6).\\nUses and administration\\nAsthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary  \\ndisease (COPD)\\nAtropine is well absorbed, even following inhalation, and produces systemic inhibition of parasympathetic nervous system activity. This severely limits its use as a bronchodi -\\nlator. However, ipratropium bromide and oxitropium bromide, both of which are potent topical anticholiner -\\ngics and bronchodilators with poor systemic absorption and hence few systemic side effects, are widely available. In adults, the routine use of topical anticholinergics is primarily reserved for the treatment of COPD. These agents have found little place in the chronic management of asthma. Anticholinergics in combination with short acting β\\n2-agonists are recommended for the acute man-\\nagement of moderate to severe asthma exacerbations in both children and adults. The usual dose of ipratropium \\nbromide nebulizer solution is 0.25–0.5  mg every 20 \\nminutes for three doses, then as needed. Alternatively, four to eight puffs from a metered dose inhaler can be used. Anticholinergics can also be used to manage beta blocker-induced asthma exacerbations and as a quick reliever in patients that cannot tolerate short-acting β\\n2- \\nagonists. Longer-acting inhaled anticholinergic prepara -\\ntions (e.g. tiotropium) can be used once daily for the management of COPD, but have only recently been shown to possibly be of benefit in asthma.only currently recommended route of administration is orally. Oral theophylline is recommended in patients  \\nwho are not well controlled on inhaled corticosteroids. Theophylline and aminophylline are rapidly and com -\\npletely absorbed from the intestinal tract. Theophylline is metabolized in the liver with a half-life of approxi -\\nmately 6 hours in normal individuals. Because of this relatively short duration of action, many slow-release preparations have been formulated to extend its duration to 8–24 hours. However, care must be taken with such preparations, as fluctuations in plasma concentrations may occur, bringing with them either lack of efficacy  \\nor potential toxicity. The main limitation of the use of theophylline has been related to side effects especially \\nwhen plasma levels exceed 20  mg/L. At high plasma con -\\ncentrations, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, nausea and vomiting, headache, and restlessness can occur. Most of the side effects can be avoided without compromising efficacy when plasma levels are maintained between 5 \\nand 10  mg/L,. Theophylline interacts with a number of \\nother drugs affecting blood levels, which also limits its utility.\\nAdding low-dose theophylline results in better asthma \\ncontrol than doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. Theophylline improves lung functions and has anti-inflammatory effects that contribute to its efficacy. Theo -\\nphylline can be used for the management of nocturnal asthma when given at night.

Free steroid molecules diffuse across the cell membrane where they interact with glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7.9). In the absence of glucocorticoids, inactive glucocor -\\nticoid receptors (GRi) are maintained in their resting \\nstate by being bound to a 90  kDa heat-shock protein. \\nInteraction with a glucocorticoid molecule leads to shed -\\nding of the heat-shock protein to expose the active site.

T wo exam -\\nples of proteins whose synthesis are up-regulated are lipomodulin, which exerts an anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the activity of phospholipase A\\n2 and metabolism once the drug enters the systemic circulation.

Of these, corticosteroid reduction of proinflamma -\\ntory cytokine production from many cells, including Th2 lymphocytes, mast cells, and eosinophils, reduction of eosinophil and mast cell influx and maturation, and pro -\\nmotion of apoptosis in inflammatory cells are likely to be the mechanisms by which corticosteroids achieve their long-term anti-inflammatory effects in chronic allergic disease (Fig. 7.11). Their therapeutic benefits are appar -\\nent within 6–12 hours of intravenous injection in acute severe asthma, and are more likely to be due to the ability of the drugs to reduce odema, reduce the local generation of ecosanoids following lipomodulin generation, reduce inflammatory cell influx and activation, and reverse adrenoceptor down-regulation.\\nThe intracellular events that are responsible for the \\nanti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids cannot be separated from their effects on glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism and their suppressive effects on the \\nFig. 7.10  P ossible mechanisms by which corticosteroids \\nreduce allergic diseases.

Clinically important adrenal insufficiency is extremely rare in patients receiving topical corticosteroids alone. In addition to adverse consequences of an individual corti-costeroid, another major consideration in choosing a par -\\nticular formulation is the delivery system. For example, the HFA preparations of beclomethasone and ciclesonide have smaller particle sizes that translate into better deliv-ery into the distal lung. In younger children and the elderly, metered-dose inhalers are sometimes difficult to use and dry-powder inhalers can be a better choice pro -\\nviding the patients have an adequate inspiratory flow rate to actuate the device and achieve good drug delivery.\\nGuidelines for the appropriate use of steroids in asthma \\nhave been formulated in many countries. Briefly, they suggest the introduction of inhaled preparations even in relatively mild asthma, increased inhaled doses as asthma becomes more severe/less controlled, and the use of oral therapy only when the disease cannot be controlled sat -\\nisfactorily by inhaled therapy. It is important to recognize that the dose–response effect of inhaled corticosteroids is relatively steep, so that more may not necessarily improve efficacy but could lead to more side effects.\\nMany important questions involving the use of  \\ninhaled corticosteroids for asthma have recently been investigated. Although inhaled corticosteroids improve symptoms, improve lung function, reduce airway hyper -\\nresponsiveness, reduce the need for rescue inhaler, and decrease overall morbidity and mortality, there is little evidence to support their effects on preventing the devel -\\nopment or significantly altering the course of asthma.\\nIn summary, inhaled corticosteroids are the best treat -\\nment for chronic persistent asthma, but have little in the way of disease-modifying effects. As with other thera -\\npies, not everyone responds to corticosteroids. Prelimi -\\nnary data suggest that risk factors for unresponsiveness include cigarette smoking and possibly obesity.\\nAllergic rhinitis\\nIn allergic rhinitis, steroid nasal sprays are used particu -\\nlarly to relieve nasal blockage. They reduce the influx of mast cells and other inflammatory cells into the nasal mucosa, but, as they do not inhibit mast cell degranula -\\ntion or inhibit the effects of histamine, they do not provide immediate relief. However, some symptom improvement has been demonstrated in less than 12 hours. Intranasal corticosteroids are the single most effec-tive therapy for allergic rhinitis and should be used unless symptoms are mild and intermittent. Although there is less evidence to support the use of intranasal corticoster -\\noids for other types of rhinitis, they are frequently the Thus, instigation of systemic treatment should begin only when bearing in mind the balance between beneficial and harmful effects of corticosteroids and with the knowl -\\nedge that suppression of the HPA axis is likely to lead to adrenocortical atrophy, particularly with prolonged parenteral treatment. Although adrenocortical atrophy is reversible, this occurs only slowly, thus making it poten -\\ntially dangerous to withdraw corticosteroids abruptly from a chronically treated patient.\\nUses and administration\\nAsthma\\nThe choice of an individual corticosteroid for the treat -\\nment of allergic disease depends on the route of admin -\\nistration. For oral use or for intravenous use, as in acute severe asthma, the drug should be rapidly absorbed and slowly metabolized, have a high affinity for the receptor, and be devoid of mineralocorticoid actions. These criteria are best met by prednisolone, prednisone, and dexame -\\nthasone. T o minimize unwanted side effects, short dura -\\ntion of parenteral therapy, generally less than 48 hours, is recommended. This is typically followed by oral dosages \\nof 0.5 to 1  mg per kilogram per day for up to 14 days. \\nNeither the optimal dose nor the duration of treatment has been defined by evidence based guidelines and treat -\\nment should be tailored to the individual patient. It is not necessary to taper oral corticosteroids and they can be abruptly stopped if given for less than 2 weeks. With the advent of newer and more potent topical preparations, it is rare for patients to be on chronic oral steroid treat -\\nment. T o minimize side effects of oral steroid treatment, lower doses given on an every-other-day schedule should be tried. The number of courses of systemic steroids an individual patient receives over the course of 6–12 months is a good indication of asthma control.\\nIn patients with chronic persistent asthma, regardless \\nof severity, the initial best treatment is an inhaled corti -\\ncosteroid. Based on the patient’s presentation, a low, medium or high daily dose should be started as recom -\\nmended by evidence-based guidelines. Differences between individual steroid preparations should be taken into account when prescribing. The ideal pharmacoki-netic properties of such a drug are slow absorption from the site of deposition and rapid metabolism once absorbed systemically. Beclomethasone has the potential for more adverse affects owing to active metabolites and is typi -\\ncally avoided in young children because of the possibility of impaired growth rates. Systemic adverse affects of newer inhaled corticosteroids are rarely seen unless the doses exceed the recommended high daily dose in evidence-based guidelines. However, individual patients should be monitored for cataracts, oral thrush, skin thin -\\nning, easy bruisability, and other potential adverse effects.

Therefore, prevention of its ability to stimulate its target organs has presented an obvious goal in drug devel -\\nopment. T oday, we know that histamine has many biologi -\\ncal actions mediated through four distinct receptors (T able 7.2). H\\n1-receptor stimulation activates phospholi -\\npase C and is responsible for most of the symptoms of the early phase allergic response including rhinorrhoea, itching and sneezing in allergic rhinitis, and whealing and pruritus in urticaria. The H\\n2-receptor stimulates cyclic \\nAMP production and is primarily involved in gastric acid secretion, although it has some amelioratory actions on inflammatory leukocytes. The H\\n3- and H 4-receptors are \\nGi linked and inhibit cyclic AMP production. Whilst the H\\n3-receptor is primarily neuroprotective in the central \\nnervous system, it has recently been demonstrated in human nasal tissue on sympathetic nerves and colocalized with H\\n1-receptors. The H 4-receptor is largely expressed \\non haemopoietic cells, particularly dendritic cells, eosi -\\nnophils, and mast cells, stimulation of which leads to amplification of histamine-mediated immune responses. H\\n4-antihistamines have recently been shown to be par -\\nticularly effective in models of pruritus, but whether this results from peripheral or central actions is not yet known. No H\\n3-antihistamines or H 4-antihistamines are \\navailable for clinical use at present, but are in clinical trials. The remainder of this chapter will focus on H\\n1-antihistamines.\\nH1-antihistamines are usually classified into the older \\nor first-generation antihistamines and the newer or second-generation antihistamines. The commonly used members of these drug classes are listed in Box 7.2 and \\nthe chemical structures of some of them shown in Figure \\n7.12. The main differences between the two generations of drugs are their propensity to cause central nervous system (CNS) sedation and their side effects. The first-generation antihistamines penetrate well into the CNS where they induce sedation. Although this sedative effect drug of choice especially for patients that have nasal polyps or non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia. Systemic therapy should be used only in extremely debilitating conditions and for a short period of time, typically less than 1 week.\\nAllergic conjunctivitis\\nSteroid eye drops are very effective in the treatment of many forms of conjunctivitis, including allergic conjunc-tivitis. In extreme conditions, the drug may also be given systemically. In eye disease, however, steroids should be used only under expert medical supervision because of their local unwanted effects. The most potentially dan-gerous of these are as follows.\\n\\ue06a Aggravation of ‘red eye’, a condition of dendritic \\nulceration caused by the herpes simplex virus, may occur. The local immunosuppressive effects of steroids worsen this condition and may lead to loss of sight, or even of the eye.\\n\\ue06a In persons predisposed to chronic simple glaucoma, \\nsteroid eye drops may induce ‘steroid glaucoma’ after a few weeks’ use. Again, this may be sight threatening.\\n\\ue06a Use of high doses of steroids for conjunctival \\ninflammation, particularly when given systemically, is associated with the development of ‘steroid cataract’. This problem is both dose and duration \\nrelated. For example, daily oral dosage with 15  mg \\nof prednisolone (or equivalent with other steroids) for prolonged periods carries a risk of ‘steroid cataract’ of around 75%.\\nUrticaria and atopic dermatitis\\nIn the skin, steroid creams and ointments are used for a wide variety of inflammatory conditions, including eczema and atopic dermatitis. They act to suppress symptoms and are in no sense curative, rebound exacerbations often occurring on cessation of treatment. They are not of value in urticaria (unless given systemically) and are contrain-dicated in rosacea and ulcerative conditions, which they worsen. Because of their local unwanted effects ( Box 7.1) \\nand their ability to be absorbed through the skin and cause systemic effects, steroids should not be the drugs of first choice but reserved for the more problematic conditions. Even then, the lowest strength of the least potent steroids should be used. Also, short courses are recommended wherever possible. The use of topical ster -\\noids in the skin of children is discouraged because of the systemic effects.\\nConclusions\\nCorticosteroids afford effective therapy in allergic disease when the appropriate formulations are given and the physician observes with diligence the basic rules to avoid unwanted effects.Box 7.1  P ossible detrimental effects of steroids in \\nthe skin\\n\\ue06a Spread and worsening of untreated infection\\n\\ue06a Thinning of the skin, which may be only partially \\nreversible\\n\\ue06a Ir reversible striae atrophicae\\n\\ue06a Increased hair growth\\n\\ue06a P erioral dermatitis\\n\\ue06a Acne at the site of application\\n\\ue06a Mild depigmentation of the skin', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 167}),\n"," Document(page_content='Principles of pharmacotherapy7\\n158\\nMechanism of action\\nH1-antihistamines are not receptor antagonists as previ-\\nously thought, but are inverse agonists; therefore the \\npreferred term for them today is ‘H 1-antihistamines’. \\nWhen neither histamine nor antihistamine is present, the active and inactive states of the H\\n1-receptor are in equi-\\nlibrium or a balanced state. Histamine combines prefer -\\nentially with the active form of the receptor to stabilize it and shift the balance towards the activated state and stimulate the cell ( Fig. 7.13 ). In contrast, H\\n1-antihistamines \\nstabilize the inactive form and shift the equilibrium in the opposite direction. Thus, the amount of histamine-induced stimulation of a cell or tissue depends on the balance between histamine and H\\n1-antihistamine.\\nHistamine effects stimulated through the H 1-receptor \\ninclude: pruritus, pain, vasodilatation, vascular permea -\\nbility, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, bron -\\nchoconstriction, and stimulation of airway vagal afferent nerves and cough receptors, and decreased atrioventricular-node conduction. Although most of the effects of hista -\\nmine in allergic diseases are mediated by H\\n1-receptor \\nstimulation, hypotension, tachycardia, flushing, and head -\\nache, cutaneous itching and nasal congestion have been suggested to have a minor component mediated through both H\\n1- and H 2-receptors.\\nThrough H 1-receptors histamine has proinflammatory \\nactivity mediated by its ability to activate the transcrip -\\ntion factor NF- κB and increase the synthesis of the adhe -\\nsion molecules e-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and cytokines including IL-8, GM-CSF, and TNF. By reduc -\\ning the production of these molecules, H\\n1-antihistamines \\nreduce the accumulation of inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils and neutrophils, and ameliorate allergic inflammation. However, these effects are minor com -\\npared with intranasal corticosteroids.\\nThere are approximately 64  000 histamine-producing \\nneurons, located in the tuberomamillary nucleus of the human brain. The H\\n1-receptor mediated actions in the \\nbrain include arousal in the circadian sleep/wake cycle, reinforcement of learning and memory, fluid balance, suppression of feeding, control of body temperature, control of cardiovascular system, and mediation of stress-triggered release of ACTH and β-endorphin from the may have some clinical benefit in the treatment of night-time exacerbations of allergy responses, especially in chil -\\ndren, it severely compromises such drug use in ambulatory patients in whom doses capable of causing only a 3–5-fold shift of the histamine dose–response curve may be given. The potential to enhance the central effects of alcohol and other CNS sedatives further limits such use. In addi -\\ntion, many of these drugs also have actions that reflect their poor receptor selectivity, including an atropine-  \\nlike effect and blockade of both α-adrenergic and \\n5-hydroxytryptamine receptors.\\nThe second-generation H\\n1-antihistamines cause much-\\nreduced CNS sedation and are essentially free of this effect at doses recommended for the treatment of rhinitis or urticaria. Consequently, the shift of the histamine dose–response curve that can be achieved with these drugs is much greater. Also, these drugs have little or no atropine-like activity or effects at other receptors. Some second-generation drugs have been suggested to have antiallergic and anti-inflammatory effects that may con-tribute to their therapeutic benefit.Table 7.2  R eceptor-mediated effects of histamine\\nTarget tissue Effect Receptor\\nAirways\\nBronchial \\nsmooth muscleContraction H1\\nBronchial epitheliumIncreased permeability H\\n1\\nSecretory glandsIncreased glycoprotein secretionH\\n1, H 2\\nSecretion H1\\nBlood vessels\\nPostcapillary \\nvenulesDilatation H1\\nIncreased permeability H1\\nNerves\\nSensory nerves Stimulation H1\\nCentral nervous \\nsystemNeuroregulation H3\\n Nose Rhinorrhoea H1\\nOedema H1\\nLeukocytes Modulation of lymphocyte functionH\\n2\\nChemotaxis of dendritic cells, mast cells and eosinophilsH\\n4Box 7.2  C ommon H 1-receptor antagonists\\nFirst generation Second generation\\nHydroxyzine Acrivastine\\nDiphenhydramine Cetirizine\\nChlorpheniramine DesloratadineFexofenadine\\nLevocetirizine\\nLoratadineMequitazineRupatadine', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 168}),\n"," Document(page_content='7\\n159H1-Antihistamines\\nfree of sedating effects and impairment of driving per -\\nformance.

Levocetirizine and cetirizine are excreted largely unchanged in urine and fexofenadine is excreted largely in the faeces.

Both of these have been successful, leading to the development of new drugs for the treatment of asthma.\\nThe LT receptor antagonists (LTRAs), montelukast, \\nzafirlukast, and pranlukast were approved in 1998, 1996 in the USA, and 1995 in Japan, respectively. Both mon -\\ntelukast and pranlukast are approved for the treatment of allergic rhinitis in adults. In 1996 the leukotriene syn -\\nthesis inhibitor, zileuton, was approved for use in the USA.\\nMechanism of action\\nThe development of drugs to inhibit the synthesis of leukotrienes has been aimed at two targets, 5-LO and 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP). Zileuton is an antioxi -\\ndant inhibitor of 5-LO. However, it is not entirely specific as it inhibits some other oxidizing enzymes, such as hepatic microsomal cytochrome enzyme, CYP3A4, involved in the metabolism of terfenadine, theophylline, Fig. 7.14  The actions of cysteinyl leukotrienes in asthma.

Low-dose inhaled corticosteroids improve pulmonary functions to a greater degree than LTRAs or zileuton. However, the differences between low-dose inhaled corticosteroid and LTRAs are not as pronounced in the risk domain, asthma exacerbation. None the less, evidence-based guidelines recommend low-dose inhaled corticosteroid over LTRAs or zileuton for the management of mild persistent asthma. T ypically, only 40–60% of patients respond to LTRAs, so physicians need to evaluate whether or not a given patient should remain on the treatment. If patients do not respond within 4–8 weeks, an alternative treatment such as inhaled corticosteroids should be used. Currently, there are no predictors or biomarkers to indicate who will respond to these agents. One caveat when considering which patients to place on LTRAs is ease of use. Patients unable to appropriately use inhalers, for example, very young children, would be candidates for LTRAs. In addi-tion, some children are more susceptible to the adverse events related to inhaled corticosteroids, especially del -\\neterious effects on growth rates, and LTRAs could be a suitable alternative. Finally, in patients that have con-comitant allergic rhinitis, using a single agent that might treat both upper and lower airway symptoms can be an attractive alternative. In patients with moderate to severe asthma, LTRAs and zileuton can be used as an add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids. There is evidence that LTRAs, or zileuton. used in this way reduce the dose of inhaled corticosteroids required by patients with moderate-to-severe asthma, or improve asthma control in patients whose asthma is not controlled with low to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids. In patients inadequately controlled by low–medium dose inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids plus LTRAs or a double dose of inhaled corticosteroids showed similar progressive improvement in several measures of asthma control com -\\npared with baseline. Moreover LTRAs plus inhaled corti -\\ncosteroids showed faster onset of action than a double dose of inhaled corticosteroids.\\nEvidence-based guidelines and Cochrane analysis indi -\\ncate that long acting β-agonists (LABAs) are superior to \\nLTRAs or zileuton as add-on therapy in patients uncon -\\ntrolled with inhaled corticosteroids.

In patients not controlled with inhaled corticoster -\\noids and LABA, there is little evidence to support additive beneficial effects of LTRAs or zileuton. An advantage of LTRAs is their administration as a tablet rather than an inhaler, since compliance is an especially critical element in controlling asthma.\\nCromolyn sodium and \\nnedocromil sodium\\nThe chromones, cromolyn sodium and nedocromil \\nsodium (Fig. 7.15) are often termed ‘antiallergic drugs’. Cromolyn sodium was originally introduced in the 1970s as a mast-cell stabilizer for the treatment of asthma while nedocromil sodium was marketed as a drug to reduce allergic inflammation. The similarity in the mechanisms of action of the two drugs indicates that they both  \\nhave the two effects, the effect on the mast cell being LTRAs and zileuton have been used for the emergency \\nmanagement of acute asthma exacerbations. Intravenous LTRAs work rapidly, within 15 minutes, and result in added bronchodilatation to short-acting β-agonists. The \\npeak effects of oral preparations are achieved later, approximately 2 hours, and result in additive bronchodil -\\natation to short-acting β-agonist as well. These effects \\nhave been demonstrated both in adults and children and suggest that LTRAs could be useful in the management of acute severe asthma.\\nLTRAs decrease the number of eosinophils in sputum \\nand peripheral blood suggesting that part of the effect of LTRAs is anti-inflammatory. LTRAs prevent exercised-induced asthma. No tolerance to the bronchoprotective effects has been observed with LTRAs.\\nApproximately 4–28% of adult patients have asthma \\nexacerbation by taking aspirin or other NSAIDs with anticyclooxygenase activity. These patients show increased production of cysteinyl leukotrienes. Inhaled corticoster -\\noids continue to be the mainstay of therapy, but LTRAs and zileuton are useful for additional control of underly -\\ning symptoms. We recommend that all patients with aspirin-induced asthma take LTRAs or zileuton.\\nAllergic rhinitis\\nIn patients with seasonal and perennial rhinitis, with or without concomitant asthma, LTRAs improved nasal, eye, and throat symptoms as well as quality of life. However, the combination of an H\\n1-antihistamine plus LTRA does \\nnot consistently provide beneficial treatment effect over either agent alone. In addition, recent studies show that intranasal corticosteroids are more effective than LTRAs either alone or in combination with an antihistamine for the relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis.\\nUrticaria and atopic dermatitis\\nLTRAs and zileuton have had limited success in managing other allergic disorders including atopic dermatitis. In combination with H\\n1-antihistamines, LTRAs and zileuton \\nmight provide marginal beneficial effect over H 1-\\nantihistamines alone for chronic urticaria.\\nSafety\\nLTRAs are generally safe and well tolerated. The inci -\\ndence of adverse effects in asthma patients is similar to those seen in placebo in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. T o date, no specific adverse effects have been reported with these drugs. Zileuton and higher doses of zafirlukast can lead to elevations of liver enzymes and possible hepatitis. In patients on zileuton, alanine  \\naminotransferase (ALT) levels should be monitored. \\nChurg–Strauss syndrome (CSS), an eosinophilic vas -\\nculitis, has been reported with all three LTRAs and zileu-ton. It is speculated that they unmask an underlying  \\nvasculitic syndrome that was suppressed by previous cor -\\nticosteroid therapy.

For maximal effect, treatment should begin 2–3 weeks before the hay-fever season and continue throughout its duration. The only unwanted effect is local irritation of the nasal mucosa, very rarely associated with transient bronchospasm.\\nAllergic conjunctivitis\\nCromolyn sodium and nedocromil sodium drops are also effective, particularly against the itch of allergic conjunc -\\ntivitis. This is likely to result from the inhibition of activa -\\ntion of the sensory nerves transducing itch.\\nConclusions\\nBecause cromolyn sodium and nedocromil sodium have almost no systemic absorption they have negligible sys-temic adverse effects. This makes them particularly useful drugs for the treatment of allergic disease in patients, especially young children, where the unwanted effects of drugs of other classes may be a problem. The most common unwanted effects following inhalation are transient cough and mild wheezing. In the nose and the eye, they may cause transient stinging.\\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory \\ndrugs\\nCyclooxygenase inhibition is the primary mechanism of \\naction of all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, indomethacin (US indomet -\\nacin), ibuprofen, or flurbiprofen. Consequently, they have the ability to cause a dose-related inhibition of the forma -\\ntion of all prostaglandins, whether potentially harmful  \\nor beneficial. In asthma, non-specific inhibition of the production of prostanoids, including the bronchocon -\\nstrictors PGD\\n2 and TXA 2, has some beneficial effects in \\nacute allergen provocation but appears to have little benefit in clinical asthma. PGE\\n2 has been suggested to \\nshift the balance of T cells in favour of a Th2 response in part by PGE\\n4-mediated mechanisms. However, \\nNSAIDs may precipitate aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) in 4–28% of adult patients, a property that precludes their indiscriminate use in asthma. AIA is characterized by increased production of cysteinyl leukotrienes, although the exact mechanism by which aspirin acts on cylooxygenases to trigger bronchoconstriction remains unknown (Fig. 7.16 ).\\nPGD\\n2 mediates a number of proinflammatory effects \\nthrough the interaction of two receptors: DP 1 and DP 2. \\nThe latter is a prime target for potential therapeutic agents for asthma and allergic diseases, and is reviewed later in this chapter.responsible for their ability to prevent and treat immedi-ate hypersensitivity responses and the effect on allergic inflammation.\\nBoth cromolin sodium and nedocromil sodium (see Fig. \\n7.15) are acidic drugs with pKa values of 1.0–2.5 and, consequently, exist almost exclusively in the ionized form at physiological pH (∼7.4). These physicochemical char -\\nacteristics mean that the drugs have negligible absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and must be given topi -\\ncally. Aerosols are available for asthma, both drops and sprays for rhinitis, and drops for conjunctivitis. In addi -\\ntion, oral solutions have been suggested for the topical treatment of gastrointestinal allergy. A major advantage of the drugs existing almost exclusively in the ionized form is that any drug absorbed systemically remains in the extracellular compartment, thus giving negligible toxicity.\\nMechanism of action\\nThe primary action of chromones is to inhibit a Na+/\\nK+/2Cl− cotransporter involved in the activation of both \\nmast cells and sensory neurons. This activity is shared with the loop diuretics, frusemide (US furosemide) and bumetanide. Although an action on mast cells may explain the action of the drugs on bronchoconstriction induced by allergen, exercise, and cold air, the effect induced by irritant agents, such as sulphur dioxide, is unlikely to be mast cell mediated. An effect on neuronal reflexes, pos -\\nsibly involving C-fibre sensory neurons, is more likely. The ability of nedocromil sodium to inhibit bronchocon-striction induced by bradykinin and capsaicin would support this theory. Thus, there are probably two com -\\nplementary mechanisms by which chromones may exert their beneficial effects against the early phase of acute asthma attacks.\\nUses and administration\\nAlthough cromolyn sodium and nedocromil sodium were both originally introduced for the treatment of asthma, they are now used widely as topical therapies for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis.\\nAsthma\\nUntil the turn of the century, cromolyn sodium and nedocromil sodium had a well-established place in the control of mildly to moderately severe asthma, particu -\\nlarly in children. However, because of their relatively weak action and the fact that they are ineffective in approximately 30% of patients, a series of meta-analyses concluded that their effectiveness was no better than placebo. Guidelines now reflect this. However, many cli -\\nnicians believe that, because of their freedom from toxic -\\nity, chromones may represent an appropriate therapy  \\nin children with mild asthma who are responsive to  \\nthem.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 175}),\n"," Document(page_content='Principles of pharmacotherapy7\\n166\\nincreased CD25 expression with asthma severity, \\nattempts have been made to block this arm of allergic disease pathogenesis. Initial attempts included mono -\\nclonal antibodies against Th2 cells such as keliximab. Although this treatment showed some modest improve-ment in patients with severe asthma, because of the potential side effects it has not been extensively studied. Cyclosporin (US ciclosporin) and tacrolimus have similar mechanisms inhibiting T cells and have been used for the treatment of severe asthma. Cyclosporin in early studies was shown to improve pulmonary functions in severe asthmatics, but because of side effects it has not been used extensively. An inhaled form of tacrolimus was used in patients with asthma, but was unsuccessful in meeting primary endpoints.\\nDaclizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody \\nfor the prevention of renal allograft rejection. It is specific for CD25 expressed by activated T cells and inhibits IL-2 induced proliferation by blocking the IL-2 receptor alpha chain. It does not deplete circulating CD25 + cells, \\nhowever. In a published study, moderate to severe asthma patients placed on intravenous daclizumab showed improved pulmonary functions, reduced asthma symp -\\ntoms and rescue medication use, increased time to severe exacerbations, and reduced peripheral blood eosinophil and serum eosinophil cationic protein levels.\\nAnother approach to target T and other key cells \\nimportant in the pathogenesis of allergic respiratory dis-eases is to use ligands of toll-like receptors. The ligand for the toll-4 receptor is endotoxin/lipid A. A specific form of this, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), has been used as monotherapy as well as in combination with allergen immunotherapy for the treatment of allergic dis-eases.

However, they may be of some use in conjunction with H\\n1-antihistamines in the \\ncontrol of the cutaneous symptoms of systemic mastocy -\\ntosis where they inhibit the synthesis of mast-cell-derived PGD\\n2. They may also benefit some patients with delayed \\npressure urticaria/angioedema.

Amgen 317 is a humanized \\nmonoclonal antibody to IL-4Rα that has undergone initial human clinical trials.

None the less, further development of this molecule is warranted since different routes and dosages may be important in showing clinical effectiveness. An inhaled antisense molecule to IL-4R α, AIR645, has also under -\\ngone very early clinical trials, but no positive clinical \\neffects have been reported thus far.

The inhaled form of this molecule, pitrakinra (AEROVANT™) was reported to block early and late phase allergen responses in patients with asthma.

However, this molecule has to be used in a three times per day regimen – making its utility somewhat problematic since compliance would be an issue.\\nAnti-eosinophil strategies\\nGiven the prominence of eosinophils in many patients with asthma and their putative role in the pathogenesis of allergic respiratory disorders, several therapeutic strat -\\negies have been attempted to block eosinophil-mediated effects. Initial strategies have involved using humanized monoclonal antibodies against IL-5, an important cytokine for both chemotaxis and differentiation of eosinophils. Several older studies have confirmed reductions in blood and sputum eosinophils without significant changes in airway hyperresponsiveness, lung functions, or symptoms in patients treated with anti-Il-5 monoclonal antibodies. In March 2009, two New England Journal of Medicine articles were published using mepolizumab. Unlike previ-ous studies, in order to enroll in these two studies sub -\\njects had to have a high sputum eosinophil count, greater than 3%. The investigators once again found a reduction in peripheral blood eosinophil counts. Although clinical effects were modest with either no or little effects on FEV\\n1, airway hyperresponsiveness or symptoms, there \\nwere nevertheless significant reductions in asthma exacerbations.\\nTPIASM8 is an oligonucleotide using RNA silencing.  \\nIt contains two modified phosphorothiolate antisense Immunostimulatory DNA molecules, CpG, are toll-9 \\nreceptor agonists and have been used as monotherapy and conjugated to antigen in human clinical trials. Initial human experiments showed that immunostimulatory CpG molecules linked to the predominant short ragweed allergen, Amb a 1, stimulated an antigen-specific Th2 to Th1 shift, and improved the safety margin of allergen immunotherapy. Although early studies were promising, large-scale clinical trials have been disappointing.\\nAnother approach using a toll-9 receptor agonist has \\nbeen shown to be effective in clinical trials. CYT003-QbG10 consists of a virus-like particle, Qb, and a short stretch of DNA from mycrobacteria that activates toll-like receptor 9 present in dendritic and other cells. In a recent publication CYT003-QbG10 plus house dust mite allergen were given for 10 weeks to patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis. Investigators found improvements in symptom scores, quality of life, and skin test responses to house dust mite for up to 48 weeks. This implies that long after discontinuing treatment there is sustained clini -\\ncal improvement. Interestingly, in an 80 patient seasonal allergic rhinitis study, total rhinoconjunctivitis symptom scores were shown to be improved with QbG10 molecule without allergen.\\nAnother approach targeting T cells and the early phases \\nof allergic inflammation has been to use peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists. PPAR γ \\nagonists inhibit gene expression by binding to AP1 and other coactivators inhibiting the production of important inflammatory cytokines. PPARγ agonists have been shown to be effective in murine models of asthma. Human clini -\\ncal trials are under way and it will be interesting to see whether these agents, already used for T ype II diabetes mellitus (glitazones), might also be effective for asthma.\\nTh-2 cytokine inhibitors\\nBecause of the importance of Th2 cytokines, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, strategies aimed at inhibiting their pro-duction or effects have been tried in numerous clinical trials. Initial attempts to inhibit IL-4 showed some promise, but subsequent large-scale studies with soluble IL-4 receptors and monoclonal antibodies against IL-4 have been unrewarding.\\nMonospecific anti-IL-13 strategies have been disap -\\npointing as well despite IL-13’s putative importance in the development of airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus secretion, and IgE and eotaxin production.

Indeed, strategies aimed at both IL-4 and IL-13 may be a better option.\\nIn this regard, there are several strategies aimed at \\nIL-4Rα, the common receptor chain important for both ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 177}),\n"," Document(page_content='Principles of pharmacotherapy7\\n168\\ninflammation has been shown to decrease after only 16 \\nweeks of omalizumab treatment. In patients on inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with other agents, the addition of omalizumab has been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations, improve symptom scores, reduce the need for inhaled and oral corticosteroids, and decrease the necessity of rescue medication. Omalizumab has been shown in small studies or case reports to have some ben -\\nefits in the following disorders: seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis with and without asthma, atopic derma -\\ntitis, food allergies, insect allergy, chronic urticaria with autoantibodies to either the high-affinity IgE receptor or IgE itself, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, latex allergy, chronic hyperplastic sinusitis, recurrent nasal polyposis, drug allergy, and idiopathic anaphylaxis. However, it has been reported to cause anaphylaxis through unknown mechanisms in first as well as subse -\\nquent doses. Recently, concerns about potential adverse cardiovascular events have been raised, and there is still some controversy surrounding earlier associations with malignancies.\\nMast cell mediator antagonists\\nThere have been many attempts to develop antagonists to mediators important in asthma. An antagonist to CRTH2 (a G-protein-coupled receptor) has been devel -\\noped. CRTH2 is present on Th2 cells, eosinophils, and basophils mediating activation and chemotaxis to PGD\\n2. \\nA recent 28-day phase II study in mild to moderate asthma patients with FEV\\n1 values between 60 and 80% \\nshowed promising trends with ACT-129968, an oral oligonucleotides designed to inhibit allergic inflammation by down-regulating human CCR3 and the common beta chain of IL-3, IL-5, and GM CSF. In a recent study, TPIASM8 inhibited sputum eosinophil influx by 46% and blunted the increase in total cells after allergen challenge. TPIASM8 significantly reduced the early asthmatic response, but not the late asthmatic response. The allergen-induced levels of beta-chain mRNA and CCR3 mRNA in sputum-derived cells were inhibited by TPIASM8, but no significant effects on cell surface protein expression of CCR3 and the beta chain were found.\\nAnti-TNF-α strategies\\nTNF-α has a number of effects that could be important in asthma. TNF-α can increase airway hyperresponsive-ness and the expression of key adhesion molecules impor -\\ntant for eosinophil and neutrophil chemotaxis. Moreover, it can stimulate both epithelial and endothelial cells to synthesize and release chemokines and other cytokines. Several small studies in patients with severe asthma have shown TNF-α blockers to improve lung function, quality of life, exacerbation rates, and airway hyperresponsive-ness. However, larger multisite studies have been disap-pointing. Not only has efficacy been difficult to show, but increased adverse events were recorded indicating a rela -\\ntively poor risk to benefit ratio. Thus, anti-TNF strategies have been placed on hold for further development in the management of asthma and allergic disorders.\\nStrategies aimed at IgE and  \\nmast cells\\nThe mast-cell and mast-cell-mediated events are attrac-tive targets for treating allergic inflammation. Syk kinase is an intracellular protein–tyrosine kinase that is impor -\\ntant in mast-cell and basophil activation and mediator release.

The primary principles of most pharmacotherapy are the same: symptom \\nrelief and reduction of underlying inflammation\\n\\ue06a Adrenaline (US epinephrine): potentially lifesaving in \\nanaphylaxis by restoring blood pressure and causing bronchodilatation. Patients at risk should carry a \\npreloaded syringe of adrenaline (EpiPen, Twinject or \\nequivalent) with them at all times and be taught the appropriate use with administration into the lateral thigh\\n\\ue06a Bronchodilators (β 2-agonists): increase cyclic AMP to \\nrelax bronchial smooth muscle. Short-acting β2-\\nagonists have an onset of action within 5 minutes and a duration of 4 to 6 hours whereas long-acting \\nβ\\n2-agonists (LABA) work within 30 minutes and last for \\nmore than 12 hours. LABA should be used only in \\ncombination with inhaled corticosteroids\\n\\ue06a Corticosteroids: have anti-inflammatory activity in asthma or allergic rhinitis. Should be administered topically whenever possible\\n\\ue06a Leukotriene receptor antagonists: LTRAs and zileuton improve pulmonary function and symptoms in patients with mild to moderate asthma, have anti-inflammatory \\neffects and complement the anti-inflammatory \\nproperties of corticosteroids\\n\\ue06a Methylxanthines: theophylline is used as a bronchodilator in asthma and may have an additive effect when used in conjunction with small doses of \\nβ\\n2-agonists\\n\\ue06a Anticholinergics: ipratropium (short acting) and \\ntiotropium (long acting) can be used once daily for the management of COPD, but have not been consistently \\nproven to be of benefit in asthma\\ue06a H1-antihistamines: particularly effective in reducing \\nrhinorrhoea and nasal itching in allergic rhinitis; less \\neffective against nasal blockage\\n\\ue06a Intranasal decongestants (α-agonists): effective in relieving nasal obstruction, but their use should be limited to no more than 3–5 days because of rebound \\nswelling of the nasal mucosa and drug-induced rhinitis \\n(rhinitis medicamentosa)', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 179}),\n"," Document(page_content='', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf', 'page': 180}),\n"," Document(page_content='171Introduction\\nThe practice of inoculating patients with microorganisms to prevent infec -\\ntious diseases was first developed in the late 18th century. As hay fever was \\nconsidered to be caused by an infectious organism, it was logical for Noon and Freeman to prevent hay-fever symptoms by injecting patients with pollen. Although their rationale was later shown to be incorrect, the treat -\\nment proved to be effective. During the 1920s and 1930s, at which time therapeutic options for hay fever were limited, desensitizing injections were widely administered to patients and showed varying success rates. During the past 20 to 30 years, the use of immunotherapy in some European coun-tries decreased owing to the introduction of potent and safe antiallergic drugs. Recently, however, standardization of extracts and an increased under -\\nstanding of immunological mechanisms has led to a renaissance in the use of this treatment. At the same time it has become clear that patient selection and attention to practice guidelines are both vital in achieving successful treatment.\\nOverall approach to respiratory allergy\\nThe management of allergic airway diseases is based on combining three essential interventions, including allergen avoidance, medications, and allergen-specific immunotherapy, along with education of the patient regard -\\ning home management. Initiation of immunotherapy in moderate severe disease is clinically effective. Immunotherapy interferes with the pathophysi -\\nological mechanisms of allergic inflammation, with a potential for a prolonged effect compared with symptomatic pharmacological treatment. Although many antiallergic drugs are highly effective with limited side effects, they represent a symptomatic treatment, while immunotherapy represents  \\nthe only treatment capable of altering the natural course of the disease.  \\nUsing an appropriately selected allergen extract in patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma, immunotherapy can significantly reduce the severity of symptoms, the need for antiallergic drugs, and improve disease-specific quality of life.Allergen-specific \\nimmunotherapy\\nHans-Jørgen Malling, Jonathan Corren and  \\nPeter S Creticos8\\nDEFINITION\\nAllergen-specific \\nimmunotherapy (SIT) is the method in which increasing doses of allergen are administered to allergic subjects, thereby modulating the immune system and leading to a reduction in clinical symptoms.\\n© 2012 Elsevier Ltd\\nDOI: 10.1016/B978-0-7234-3658-4.00005-6 171', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/266/asthma/Allergy and Asthma.pdf',
